## Article summary
President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a grand, classically styled arch in Washington, D.C., to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary. The arch, designed by architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, features eagles and a gilded, winged statue symbolizing Victory. Trump showed models of the arch during a fundraising dinner at the White House, suggesting the largest design would dwarf nearby landmarks like the Lincoln Memorial. The proposed location for the arch is a traffic circle between Arlington National Cemetery and the Lincoln Memorial. When asked who the arch would be built for, Trump replied, 'Me.' The design of federal buildings and memorials typically requires approval from the Commission of Fine Arts, but the White House referred inquiries back to Trump's comments. The arch is intended to be a significant addition to the nation's capital, reflecting Trump's vision for a monumental tribute.
