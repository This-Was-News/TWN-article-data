## Article summary
President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas, stating that if internal bloodshed in Gaza persists, there will be no choice but to take violent action. This warning came after a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, which Trump had previously downplayed. Trump clarified that U.S. troops would not be involved, implying that nearby forces would handle the situation. The shift in Trump's tone towards Hamas was notable, as he had earlier acknowledged Hamas's actions against rival factions. The Hamas-run police had maintained security but have since dissipated as Israeli forces targeted them. Powerful local families and armed gangs have exploited the void, often hijacking humanitarian aid. The ceasefire plan required Hamas to hand over hostages, living and dead, by a deadline that passed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded Hamas fulfill the ceasefire terms regarding hostage remains. Hamas claimed to have honored the ceasefire terms by handing over accessible remains. The U.S. is sending troops to Israel to support the ceasefire but will not enter Gaza. Israeli officials expressed frustration over the slow return of hostage remains, while U.S. advisers believe Hamas is working to comply with the deal.
