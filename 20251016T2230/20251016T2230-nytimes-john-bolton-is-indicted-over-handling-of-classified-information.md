## Article summary
John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of mishandling classified information. The charges stem from Bolton sending over 1,000 pages of diary notes, including top-secret details, to individuals without security clearances. The investigation gained momentum under the Biden administration, and the indictment was pursued by career prosecutors. Bolton's emails were reportedly hacked by someone associated with the Iranian government. Bolton's lawyer argues that the diaries were unclassified and shared only with family. The case is part of a broader pattern of high-profile officials facing charges under the Espionage Act, including Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The indictment is unusual in that it followed standard Justice Department procedures, unlike other politically charged cases. Bolton's prosecution is seen as distinct from other Trump-era cases, with more evidentiary foundation.
