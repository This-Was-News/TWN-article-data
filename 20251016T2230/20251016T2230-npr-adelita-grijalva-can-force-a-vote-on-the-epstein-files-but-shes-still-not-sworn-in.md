## Article summary
Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, has faced delays in being sworn into Congress due to partisan tensions and a government shutdown. Despite winning her seat over three weeks ago, she has not been sworn in, leaving her without staff, a working phone, or a government email. House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to swear her in until the shutdown ends, a departure from his previous practice of swearing in new members quickly. Grijalva's supporters and Democrats accuse Johnson of delaying her swearing-in to avoid a vote on releasing the Epstein files, which she promised to support. Johnson denies these accusations, stating that Republicans are already investigating the matter. The delay has sparked protests and legal threats, with Arizona's Attorney General threatening action to force the oath of office. Grijalva, the daughter of the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, hopes to follow her father's legacy once she is seated.
