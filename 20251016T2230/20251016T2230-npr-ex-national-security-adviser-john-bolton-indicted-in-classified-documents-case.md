## Article summary
John Bolton, former national security adviser under President Trump, has been indicted on 18 charges related to the mishandling of classified documents. The charges include eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of unlawful retention of such information. Bolton is accused of using personal email and messaging apps to handle classified information, including details about future attacks and foreign policy relations. The Justice Department emphasizes that all Americans are subject to the same legal standards regarding national security. The charges follow an FBI search of Bolton's home, where classified documents were reportedly found. Bolton, who has been critical of Trump, published a memoir in 2020 that led to a legal battle over classified information. The indictment is part of a series of recent legal actions against former Trump administration officials and critics, including James Comey and Letitia James.
