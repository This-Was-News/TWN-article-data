## Article summary
The Tomahawk cruise missile, in use since the 1980s, is a low-flying, hard-to-detect weapon with a range of about 1,000 miles and precision guidance. It is favored for striking deep inland or hostile targets. President Trump has hinted at providing Tomahawks to Ukraine, which could significantly impact its war with Russia. The U.S. Navy had around 4,000 Tomahawks in 2023, but stocks have been depleted by actions against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Navy and Marine Corps have not been ordering many new missiles, with only 68 bought in 2023 and none in subsequent years. Defense officials express skepticism about giving Tomahawks to Ukraine due to concerns about their employment. Ukraine lacks the naval capability to launch the missiles, and while the U.S. Army is developing a ground-launch platform, it is not yet ready.
