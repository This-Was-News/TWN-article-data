## Article summary
John Bolton, former national security adviser under President Trump, has been charged with storing and sharing classified information. The 18-count indictment alleges that Bolton kept top-secret records at home and shared diary-like notes containing classified details with family members. The investigation into Bolton's handling of classified information was made public when the FBI searched his home and office in August. The case is set against a backdrop of political tensions, with Bolton known for his hawkish views and subsequent criticism of Trump. Bolton's lawyer argues that the diaries are unclassified and shared only with immediate family, and that the FBI was aware of their existence. The indictment details Bolton's sharing of over 1,000 pages of sensitive information, including details about foreign adversaries and covert actions. The case follows other indictments against former high-profile officials, but it is more detailed and was filed by a career prosecutor. Bolton's history includes serving in various government roles under multiple administrations, and his tenure as Trump's national security adviser ended in 2019 amid disputes over foreign policy. The charges come amid broader concerns about political weaponization of the Justice Department.
