## Article summary
A new AP-NORC poll reveals that most Americans view the ongoing government shutdown as a significant problem, with blame distributed among President Donald Trump, Republicans, and Democrats. The shutdown, now in its third week, is tied to a stalemate over extending tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance. The poll shows that 60% blame Trump and Republicans, while 54% blame Democrats. The shutdown is causing widespread disruptions, including flight delays and financial strain on federal employees. Democrats are pushing for the extension of health insurance subsidies, while Republicans refuse to negotiate until the government reopens. The public's frustration is higher towards the party in power, with Trump and Republicans receiving the most blame. The poll also indicates that health care could be a key issue for Democrats in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Despite the shutdown, public opinion on both parties remains largely unchanged, with low confidence in Congress. The poll was conducted with a sample of 1,289 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.
