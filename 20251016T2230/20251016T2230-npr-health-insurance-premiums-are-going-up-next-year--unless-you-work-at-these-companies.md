## Article summary
Health insurance premiums in the U.S. are rising significantly, with the average annual premium for a family of four exceeding $25,500. Employers and workers share these costs, but premiums have surged over 24% since 2019. Factors driving up costs include higher drug prices, increased demand for medical services post-pandemic, and consolidation in the healthcare industry. Many employees face potential paycheck deductions of 6% to 7% next year. Some companies, however, are covering employees' premiums entirely. Boston Consulting Group, for instance, pays full premiums for its 10,000 U.S. employees and their families, viewing it as an investment in productivity and retention. Other companies, including startups and nonprofits, also offer zero-premium health insurance, though often with trade-offs like higher deductibles. These employers believe that providing comprehensive health coverage helps attract and retain talent, fostering a healthier and more focused workforce.
