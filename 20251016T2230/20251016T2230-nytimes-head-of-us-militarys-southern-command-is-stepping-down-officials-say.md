## Article summary
Admiral Alvin Holsey, head of the U.S. Southern Command, is stepping down less than a year into his tenure amid escalating attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea. The Pentagon has deployed around 10,000 forces in the region for counterdrug and counterterrorism missions. Holsey's departure follows concerns he raised about the mission and attacks on alleged drug boats. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth praised Holsey's service but did not mention any friction. Tensions exist over Venezuela policy, with the U.S. aiming to remove President Nicolás Maduro. Legal experts dispute the Trump administration's justification for killing suspected drug traffickers. Holsey's departure is part of a broader trend of military leaders, many of whom are people of color or women, leaving their posts. Hegseth has fired or pushed out several high-ranking officials. The U.S. military is considering further escalation, including strikes inside Venezuela. The buildup includes 10,000 troops, eight warships, and a submarine in the Caribbean.
