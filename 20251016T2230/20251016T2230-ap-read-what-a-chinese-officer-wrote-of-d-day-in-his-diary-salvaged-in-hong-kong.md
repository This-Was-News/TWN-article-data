## Article summary
A Chinese officer, Lam Ping-yu, documented his experiences aboard the HMS Ramillies during the D-Day invasion in a diary. The diary, rescued from a Hong Kong tenement, reveals his firsthand account of the historic event. Lam and 23 other Chinese officers were sent to Europe to train and serve with Allied forces. His detailed diary, written in Chinese, provides a unique perspective on the Normandy landings. The diary was found by urban explorers and verified through historical records and ship logs. An exhibition in Ouistreham, France, now showcases Lam's story and the contributions of Chinese officers in World War II. Lam's daughter, Sau Ying Lam, learned about her father's wartime experiences through the diary. The diary also highlights a narrow brush with death when torpedoes were fired at their ship. Lam's account adds to the vast library of World War II memories, ensuring the sacrifices and international cooperation are remembered. The diary, though lost again, was photographed before its disappearance, preserving Lam's account for future generations.
