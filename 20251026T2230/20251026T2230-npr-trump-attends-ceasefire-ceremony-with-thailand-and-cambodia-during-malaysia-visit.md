## Article summary
During his visit to Malaysia for the 47th ASEAN summit, U.S. President Donald Trump attended a ceasefire ceremony between Thailand and Cambodia. Trump's threats of economic pressure were instrumental in prompting the two nations to halt border skirmishes, leading to an expanded ceasefire agreement. The deal includes the release of Cambodian prisoners by Thailand and the withdrawal of heavy artillery by Cambodia, with regional observers monitoring the situation. This event marked Trump's first engagement after arriving in Kuala Lumpur, where he also signed economic agreements with Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia aimed at increasing trade in critical minerals and reducing reliance on China. The summit provided an opportunity for Trump to enhance his image as an international dealmaker amidst domestic economic challenges and feuds. He expressed optimism about strengthening partnerships with ASEAN nations, emphasizing cooperation for secure supply chains. The ceasefire ceremony was particularly significant, with analysts suggesting Trump's leverage of tariffs was the primary driver for the agreement, potentially positioning him for a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the reconciliation, while Thai officials described the deal as a commitment to renewing relations. Trump's trip also included discussions on potential trade deals with China, Japan, and South Korea, though tensions with Canada over tariffs were also evident. The U.S. Treasury Secretary hinted at a possible de-escalation of the trade confrontation with China.
