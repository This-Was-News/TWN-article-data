## Article summary
President Donald Trump's push to have Republican lawmakers redraw congressional districts in Indiana and Kansas to favor the GOP has encountered significant resistance. Despite weeks of campaigning, including White House meetings and visits from Vice President JD Vance, Republican lawmakers in both states report lacking sufficient votes to pass new, more GOP-friendly maps. This situation makes Indiana and Kansas outliers in the national redistricting efforts, where Republican-majority legislatures are typically aligning with Trump's call to maintain control of the U.S. House. While the White House push is expected to continue, this represents a rare setback for Trump's efforts to secure a compliant Congress after the 2026 midterms. Some Republican lawmakers in Indiana oppose the redistricting, citing concerns that poorly executed maps could make solid Republican districts more competitive or that it is fundamentally wrong for a party to select its voters. In Kansas, Republican leaders are attempting to force a special session to redraw districts, bypassing the Democratic governor, but are struggling to gather the necessary signatures, with some Republican representatives refusing to sign the petition. These holdouts reflect an independent streak among voters in both states and a willingness by some lawmakers to push back against the gerrymandering efforts. Democrats are also actively working to counter potential GOP gains through their own redistricting initiatives in states like Virginia.
