## Article summary
A U.S. warship, the USS Gravely, has docked in Trinidad and Tobago's capital, Port-of-Spain, as the Trump administration intensifies military pressure on Venezuela and its President Nicolás Maduro. This arrival complements the presence of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which is moving closer to Venezuelan waters. Maduro has condemned these naval movements as an attempt by the U.S. to instigate a "new eternal war" against his country. President Trump has also accused Maduro, without providing evidence, of leading the organized crime gang Tren de Aragua. The USS Gravely is scheduled to remain in Trinidad until Thursday for joint training exercises between the two nations, aimed at addressing shared threats like transnational crime and enhancing resilience through training and security efforts. The visit occurs shortly after the U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago issued a warning to Americans regarding potential threats. However, the docking of the warship has drawn criticism from many in Trinidad and Tobago, with some, like David Abdulah of the Movement for Social Justice, deeming it an "abomination" given the proximity to Venezuela and the threat of war. Despite this, Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has been a supporter of U.S. military actions in the region. The regional trade bloc Caricom advocates for dialogue, though Persad-Bissessar has noted the Caribbean is not a zone of peace due to prevalent violent crime.
