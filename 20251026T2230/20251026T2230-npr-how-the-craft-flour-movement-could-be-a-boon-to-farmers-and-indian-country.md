## Article summary
The craft flour movement is offering a ray of hope for farmers in the Pacific Northwest, who have been struggling with low wheat prices and trade war uncertainties. Cairnspring Mills is constructing a new craft flour mill on the Umatilla Indian Reservation near Pendleton, Oregon. This expansion will significantly increase the company's production and provide a local market for wheat farmers, reducing their reliance on the unpredictable export market. The mill aims to process approximately 2 million bushels of wheat annually. This initiative is seen as a positive development for the reservation, which has historically had limited economic drivers beyond its casino. The mill is projected to create around 20 jobs, with a commitment to prioritizing training and hiring for Native individuals. Tribal officials view this project as a sign that Indian Country is open for business and offers a hopeful economic future for small rural communities.
