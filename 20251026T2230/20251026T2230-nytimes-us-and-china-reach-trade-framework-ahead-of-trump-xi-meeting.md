## Article summary
President Trump's Asia tour includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with a key meeting scheduled with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In Malaysia, Trump secured agreements on export controls, sanctions, and critical minerals from Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia, aiming to contain China's influence. He also presided over a peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand. Trade talks with Canada were suspended by Trump after an advertisement critical of tariffs aired, leading to threats of additional tariffs. Meanwhile, US and Chinese trade negotiators made progress on a framework deal, including agricultural purchases and fentanyl-related tariffs, ahead of the leaders' meeting. The US government faces a shutdown threat, with federal food aid potentially halted due to a dispute over Senate Democrats' negotiations on healthcare costs. Concerns remain about the specifics of the TikTok deal, with American investors expected to hold a majority stake. Senator Lindsey Graham suggested a congressional briefing on potential military operations in Venezuela and Colombia. Senator Rand Paul criticized the administration's approach to prosecuting drug traffickers, advocating for prosecution over military strikes. Japan and South Korea are also navigating trade negotiations and security concerns related to China during Trump's visit.
