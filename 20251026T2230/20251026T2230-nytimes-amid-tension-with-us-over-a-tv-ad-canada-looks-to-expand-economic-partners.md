## Article summary
Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney is navigating a trade dispute with President Trump by focusing on controllable aspects, such as seeking new economic partnerships abroad, particularly in Asia. This strategy comes after a recent incident involving an advertisement paid for by the Ontario government, which used audio of former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. President Trump reacted by suspending trade talks and threatening additional tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the ad would cease airing. Canada has previously made concessions, including withdrawing retaliatory tariffs and suspending a tax on American tech companies, to facilitate trade talks. Carney's new motto emphasizes focusing on what Canada can control, shifting attention to international economic ties. Critics of Trump's reaction suggest it highlights his tendency to make impulsive decisions that could harm American interests. Experts believe Canada is banking on American public and industry discontent over tariffs to pressure Trump. The prevailing Canadian approach, as described by experts, is to "hunker down" and avoid escalating the conflict, as picking a fight with the U.S. president is seen as counterproductive. Carney's strategy appears to be that patience and leveraging American dissatisfaction with the tariffs will ultimately benefit Canada, rather than engaging in direct confrontation.
