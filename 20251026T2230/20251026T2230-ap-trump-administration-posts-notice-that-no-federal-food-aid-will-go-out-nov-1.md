## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced that federal food aid, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), will not be distributed on November 1st due to the ongoing government shutdown. This decision impacts approximately one in eight Americans who rely on SNAP for groceries. The Trump administration stated it would not use contingency funds to continue benefits, citing legal restrictions and the need to reserve such funds for disaster relief. The shutdown, which began October 1st, is now the second-longest on record, and this cutoff would significantly expand its impact on vulnerable populations. The administration blames Senate Democrats for the impasse, while Democrats insist on negotiating Affordable Care Act subsidies before reopening the government. Democratic lawmakers requested the use of contingency funds, but a USDA memo confirmed these funds are not legally available for regular benefits. States are concerned about the halt in payments, with some pledging to continue benefits while acknowledging potential federal reimbursement issues. Other states are advising SNAP recipients to prepare for the cessation of aid and seek assistance from food banks. Senator Chris Murphy criticized Republicans and President Trump for refusing to negotiate, suggesting a resolution could be reached quickly if talks commenced.
