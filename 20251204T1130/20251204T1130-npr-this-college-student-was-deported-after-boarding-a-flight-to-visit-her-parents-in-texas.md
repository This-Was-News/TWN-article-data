## Article summary
Any López Belloza, a student at Babson College, was deported to Honduras after boarding a flight to Austin, Texas, with the intention of surprising her family for the holidays. Her attorney, Todd Pomerleau, asserts that this deportation violates a federal court order issued by Massachusetts U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on November 21st, which barred the government from deporting López Belloza until her case could be heard. Pomerleau stated that López Belloza, who came to the U.S. at age seven seeking asylum with her family, was flown to Texas and deported on November 22nd, before the court could review her case. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed her arrest on Thanksgiving but did not explain why it proceeded despite the judge's order, stating she received "full due process." Pomerleau is actively fighting for her return, emphasizing her lack of criminal background and her status as a student pursuing an "American dream." Babson College is providing academic support to López Belloza, who is currently staying with her grandparents in Honduras, and is staying informed about the legal proceedings.
