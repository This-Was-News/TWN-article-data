## Article summary
President Donald Trump's recent remarks describing Somalis as "garbage" and stating they "destroyed our country" have deeply shocked the largest Somali community in the United States, located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Trump's comments, made during a Tuesday Cabinet meeting and reiterated the next day, targeted the Somali population, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, whom he called a "fool." These statements coincide with reports of a federal immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota focusing on Somalis living illegally in the U.S., though most Somalis in the state are U.S. citizens. Somali-born entrepreneur Hamse Warfa, now a proud American citizen and successful businessman, countered Trump's rhetoric by stating, "I am not garbage." He noted that such anti-immigrant language has been used against other groups, like Haitians, in past elections. The Somali community in Minnesota, numbering around 84,000, has been in the state since the 1990s, contributing to the economy, revitalizing neighborhoods, and gaining political representation, including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar. Despite facing challenges, such as being typecast due to past fraud schemes, Somali leaders and allies, including Mayor Frey and Governor Tim Walz, have pledged to protect the community and denounced the president's divisive language. Community members express a desire for the rhetoric to cease, wishing to focus on everyday life and future aspirations rather than being disparaged by the president.
