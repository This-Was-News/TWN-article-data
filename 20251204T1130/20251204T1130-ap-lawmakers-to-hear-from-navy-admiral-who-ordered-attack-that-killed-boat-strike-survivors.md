## Article summary
Navy Admiral Frank Mitch Bradley, who commanded U.S. Special Operations Command, is scheduled to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill regarding an alleged order to fire upon survivors of an attack on a drug boat near Venezuela. This briefing comes amid a congressional investigation into Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's handling of the operation, with questions arising about potential legal violations. Lawmakers are seeking a full account of the strikes, particularly after reports that Bradley ordered an attack on survivors to comply with Hegseth's directive to kill everyone. Legal experts suggest this could be a crime if survivors were intentionally targeted. Bradley will brief key congressional leaders on national security committees and the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senators have expressed the seriousness of the matter, emphasizing the need for transparency and facts. Key questions for Bradley include the nature of Hegseth's orders and the rationale behind the second strike. Democratic lawmakers are demanding the release of video and written records, while Republicans have pledged a thorough review. Hegseth has defended his actions, citing the "fog of war" and stating Bradley had full authority for the second strike. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, with lawmakers seeking accountability for anyone responsible if survivors were indeed targeted.
