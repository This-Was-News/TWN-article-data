## Article summary
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has signed an executive order aimed at deterring a potential federal immigration crackdown. This action comes as the city's Somali community prepares for possible Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity. The order establishes clear guidelines for city agencies regarding federal immigration enforcement within Minneapolis. It requires federal agents to present a judicial warrant before entering private property or making arrests. This move is intended to protect residents from overreach and ensure due process. The Somali community has expressed concerns about increased surveillance and potential detentions. Community leaders have been actively engaging with city officials to address these fears. The executive order seeks to build trust and reinforce the city's commitment to its residents' rights. A sign stating "No ICE enter without court order" was observed at Karmel Mall, reflecting the community's stance. The order aims to prevent a climate of fear and ensure that federal immigration actions align with legal standards and city values.
