## Article summary
The U.S. Institute of Peace has been renamed the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, with the president's name now displayed on its headquarters, despite an ongoing legal battle over its control. The Trump administration seized the independent think tank, firing its board and staff, an action described by the administration as necessary to reform a "bloated, useless entity." Critics, however, view the renaming as adding "insult to injury," especially after a federal judge ruled the government's takeover illegal, though this ruling is currently under appeal. The institute, created by Congress in the 1980s to promote peace and prevent conflict, maintains it is an independent body, while the administration asserts it is an executive branch organization. The building's control has switched hands multiple times through court actions, with a final decision pending. Despite the legal turmoil, the institute's website highlighted President Trump's upcoming role in signing a peace agreement between the presidents of Congo and Rwanda at the headquarters. This event is seen by some as a potential backdrop for Trump to receive further accolades, with speculation also arising about a potential peace prize from FIFA.
