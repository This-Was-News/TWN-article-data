## Article summary
New York Attorney General Letitia James is challenging the authority of acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone, arguing his appointment is unlawful. This legal challenge stems from Sarcone's investigation into regulatory lawsuits James filed against Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association. James' lawyers contend that Sarcone's appointment circumvented federal law, rendering any actions he takes, including issuing subpoenas, invalid. They are seeking to have these subpoenas quashed and Sarcone disqualified from the investigation. Justice Department lawyers, however, maintain that Sarcone was appointed properly and has the authority to conduct investigations. This case echoes similar legal battles in other districts, such as Virginia, New Jersey, Nevada, and Los Angeles, where judges have questioned or overturned the appointments of acting U.S. attorneys under the Trump administration. These disputes often revolve around the administration's use of interim appointments to bypass Senate confirmation for U.S. attorney positions. In New York, Sarcone's appointment followed a path where district judges declined to keep him in the post after his initial term expired, leading to a maneuver by the Attorney General to reappoint him. The outcome of this hearing could significantly impact the ongoing investigation and broader legal challenges to the administration's appointment strategies for federal prosecutors.
