## Article summary
The U.S. health care system is facing a deepening crisis, with rising costs and financial struggles affecting both consumers and major industry players. Despite the increasing expense of insurance plans, both through the Affordable Care Act and employer-sponsored options, many Americans anticipate being unable to afford necessary medical care. This surge in costs is attributed to factors like expensive new drug treatments, increased demand for services post-pandemic, and consolidation within the industry. Simultaneously, large health care corporations, including UnitedHealth Group, are experiencing significant financial difficulties. UnitedHealth Group, a major player in insurance, healthcare provision, and pharmacy benefits, has seen its stock price plummet due to issues within its Medicare Advantage business, leading to regulatory scrutiny and a change in leadership. The company is now attempting to reduce its involvement in Medicare Advantage to improve its financial standing. Wall Street, which once viewed health care stocks as safe investments, is now anticipating continued volatility in the sector. Analysts suggest that while a long-term turnaround is possible, it may require considerable patience from investors, with a murky outlook for the next few years.
