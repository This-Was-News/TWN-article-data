## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that certain proposals within a U.S. plan to end the war in Ukraine are unacceptable to the Kremlin, suggesting that a resolution remains distant despite significant diplomatic efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump has initiated intensive talks aimed at halting the conflict, but fundamental disagreements persist, particularly concerning territorial concessions and future security guarantees for Ukraine. Putin described his recent five-hour meeting with U.S. envoys as necessary and useful, though challenging, with some points of the U.S. peace proposal being non-negotiable for Russia. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are scheduled to continue discussions with Ukraine's lead negotiator in Miami. Putin indicated that revealing specific details of the talks could jeopardize the peace process. Meanwhile, European leaders have expressed skepticism about Putin's genuine interest in peace, accusing him of feigning engagement. The conflict continues with ongoing Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian areas, resulting in casualties and damage to infrastructure, including a recent missile strike on Kryvyi Rih and shelling in Kherson and Odesa. In occupied Kherson, two men were reportedly killed by a Ukrainian drone strike.
