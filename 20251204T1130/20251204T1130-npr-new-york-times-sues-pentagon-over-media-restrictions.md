## Article summary
The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Pentagon over a new media policy. This policy requires media outlets to pledge not to gather information unless the Defense Department officially authorizes its release. The policy also bans credentialed journalists from reporting unclassified material not expressly approved for public consumption. In response, The New York Times and other organizations, including NPR, have surrendered their press passes rather than comply. The lawsuit argues that Hegseth's policy violates constitutional protections for free speech and freedom of the press, abandoning public scrutiny by independent news organizations. The Times also alleges the Pentagon violated their reporters' due process rights by making decisions about press passes without an appeal process. This situation draws parallels to restrictions imposed during the Trump administration against news outlets critical of the government. The New York Times is being represented by Theodore J. Boutrous, who is also involved in NPR's lawsuit against the White House. The Pentagon's press access policy has been criticized as giving government officials unchecked power over credentialing, which the First Amendment prohibits. Recently, the Pentagon welcomed a new group of correspondents willing to adhere to its policy, including individuals with pro-Trump leanings.
