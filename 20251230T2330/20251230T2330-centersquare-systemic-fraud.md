## Article summary
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner has condemned over $5.8 billion in questionable payments made by the department, citing "systemic fraud." A report from HUD's Office of the Chief Financial Officer flagged these payments, with approximately $1.5 billion identified in the Tenant Based Rental Assistance program and $4.3 billion in the Project Based Rental Assistance program. This means over 25% of PBRA spending was potentially fraudulent. Further analysis revealed eligibility issues for over 200,000 tenants, with about $150 million going to individuals with non-conforming Social Security numbers. Additionally, around $77 million was disbursed to approximately 30,000 deceased individuals. HUD's Principal Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Irving Dennis, noted a decline in internal controls and governance under the Biden administration, including poor record-keeping and a lack of effective oversight. Turner stated that HUD will investigate these findings and hold accountable those responsible. The administration aims to crack down on housing assistance fraud, emphasizing federal spending transparency.
