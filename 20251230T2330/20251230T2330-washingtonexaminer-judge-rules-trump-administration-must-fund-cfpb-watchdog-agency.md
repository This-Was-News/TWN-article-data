## Article summary
A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a watchdog agency the administration sought to shut down. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson criticized the administration's efforts to defund the agency, stating it was an attempt to circumvent a previous court order preventing its closure. The administration had argued it was legally barred from funding the CFPB due to issues with the Federal Reserve's financial status, but the judge dismissed this as a baseless pretext. Opponents of the CFPB's closure, including the attorneys general of 21 states and the District of Columbia, argue that dismantling the agency would weaken consumer protections and leave individuals vulnerable to financial exploitation. California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that closing the bureau would result in hundreds of thousands of consumer complaints being ignored. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who proposed the CFPB's creation, praised the ruling, highlighting the agency's success in returning billions of dollars to consumers wronged by financial institutions. The Trump administration, however, has viewed the CFPB as a burden on American free enterprise.
