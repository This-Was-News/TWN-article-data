## Article summary
New details are emerging about a U.S. strike on a suspected drug loading site in Venezuela, with reports suggesting a CIA drone carried out the operation. President Donald Trump confirmed the strike, describing the targeted site as an "implementation area" that no longer exists, but declined to confirm the CIA's involvement. CNN reported, citing sources, that the strike targeted a remote dock believed to be used by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua for drug storage and shipping. This strike marks the first known land strike by the U.S. in Venezuela since counter-narcotics operations intensified in the Caribbean. The U.S. Southern Command also confirmed a separate lethal kinetic strike on a marine vessel in the Eastern Pacific, resulting in the deaths of two narco-terrorists. These actions coincide with increased U.S. military presence in the region, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group. The administration has been actively targeting suspected drug trafficking vessels off the coast of Venezuela.
