## Article summary
Colorado's legal marijuana industry has surpassed $1 billion in sales for 2025, generating nearly $200 million in tax and fee revenue for the state. Governor Jared Polis highlighted the industry's role in driving revenue for school construction and supporting businesses and jobs, while also combating criminal activity. Colorado was the first U.S. state to approve recreational marijuana sales in 2012 and has since collected over $3 billion in tax revenue from nearly $18 billion in sales. This revenue has funded infrastructure projects and public schools. Recently, President Donald Trump signed an executive order reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, acknowledging its medical uses and signaling a shift in federal policy. Governor Polis praised this decision as long overdue, stating it aligns federal policy with Colorado's progressive cannabis regulations. However, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for increased accessibility to high-potency THC products and potential negative consequences, such as rising traffic deaths and mental health issues, as suggested by critics like Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. Complete sales data for 2025 will be available in February.
