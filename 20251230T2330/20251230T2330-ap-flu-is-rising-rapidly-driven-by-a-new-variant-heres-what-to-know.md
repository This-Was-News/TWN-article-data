## Article summary
Flu cases are rapidly increasing across the United States, primarily due to a new variant known as subclade K. This variant has already caused early outbreaks in other countries and is contributing to a significant rise in illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths this season. While it's too early to determine the full severity of the season, experts emphasize that flu vaccination is still beneficial. The current vaccine may not be a perfect match for subclade K, but preliminary data suggests it offers partial protection, reducing the risk of hospitalization. Flu viruses constantly mutate, and subclade K is a modified version of the H3N2 strain, which is typically harsh, especially for older adults. Although the mutations are not enough to classify it as a new flu type, they allow it to evade some vaccine-induced protection. The CDC recommends flu vaccination for nearly everyone six months and older, particularly those at higher risk, such as the elderly, pregnant women, young children, and individuals with chronic health conditions. While the vaccine might not perfectly match the new variant, it is expected to provide good protection against other circulating strains like H1N1 and Type B flu. Flu vaccines are available as shots and nasal sprays, with some individuals now eligible for self-administration of the nasal spray at home.
