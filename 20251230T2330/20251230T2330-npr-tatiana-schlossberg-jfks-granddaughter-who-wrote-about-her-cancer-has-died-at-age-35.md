## Article summary
Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of former President John F. Kennedy, has died at the age of 35 after a battle with acute myeloid leukemia with inversion 3, a rare and aggressive form of blood cancer. Schlossberg, a journalist and author known for her environmental writings, revealed her diagnosis in an essay published in The New Yorker on November 22. In the essay, she detailed her struggle with the disease, the pain it caused her and her loved ones, and the discovery of her cancer on the day she gave birth to her second child. She noted that despite fighting the disease for over a year, treatments had not led to remission. Schlossberg also used her essay to criticize her first cousin once removed, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., citing concerns about his vaccine skepticism and antipathy towards medical research funding. She expressed that his actions made the healthcare system she relied on feel strained. Her death was announced by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. Schlossberg is survived by her parents, siblings, husband, and two children. Experts believe her personal account is crucial in raising awareness and potentially spurring interest in medical research funding.
