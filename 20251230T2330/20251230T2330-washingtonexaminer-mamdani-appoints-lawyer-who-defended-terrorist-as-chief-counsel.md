## Article summary
New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has appointed Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer who has defended an al Qaeda terrorist and a Palestinian activist, as his chief counsel. Kassem, also a law professor, will advise Mamdani and City Hall on legal matters. He previously helped defend al Qaeda member Ahmed al Darbi, convicted of bombing a French oil tanker, and represented Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Kassem has also participated in anti-Israel protests and criticized the "Israeli wrap" sandwich for being offensive. He is a co-founder of a project providing legal defense for students detained by ICE and previously advised former President Joe Biden. Mamdani stated that Kassem and corporation counsel Steven Banks will be crucial in fighting for working people's safety and freedoms. Kassem expressed his commitment to defending New Yorkers and ensuring the city is a place where all can thrive. However, the appointment has drawn criticism, with some suggesting it will alienate the Jewish community, given Mamdani's past controversies regarding anti-Israel statements.
