## Article summary
The Secret History of the War in Ukraine, by Adam Entous, details America's deep and intimate involvement in the Ukraine War, a partnership that became the secret weapon for Ukraine's survival and defense of the post-World War II order. This collaboration, orchestrated from Clay Kaserne in Wiesbaden, Germany, involved intelligence sharing, strategic planning, and technology transfer, with American and Ukrainian officers working side-by-side. Initially, the partnership aimed to help Ukraine achieve unlikely feats against a larger, more powerful enemy, leading to early successes like the targeting of Russian battle groups and the Black Sea Fleet. However, the alliance faced strains due to rivalries, resentments, and diverging objectives, with Ukrainians sometimes viewing Americans as overbearing and Americans struggling to understand Ukrainian strategic ambitions. Despite tactical triumphs, internal Ukrainian politics significantly impacted major offensives, leading to strategic failures. The partnership also operated under the shadow of geopolitical fears, particularly concerning nuclear escalation. Over time, the Biden administration authorized clandestine operations, pushing red lines to support Ukraine, including strikes in Crimea and eventually inside Russia. The war evolved into a complex proxy conflict, with both sides learning valuable lessons for future warfare. Trust was a cornerstone, forged through direct communication and shared objectives, though challenges persisted. The narrative highlights key figures like Lt. Gen. Mykhaylo Zabrodskyi and Lt. Gen. Christopher T. Donahue, whose relationship symbolized the core of the alliance. The story underscores the precarious balance of power, the strategic decisions made, and the human cost of the conflict, ultimately revealing how the war reached its current critical juncture.
