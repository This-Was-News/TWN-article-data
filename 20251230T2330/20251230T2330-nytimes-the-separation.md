## Article summary
Donald Trump's promise to end the war in Ukraine in a day led to a complex and often contradictory negotiation process over nearly a year. Initially, the Biden administration had established a robust partnership with Ukraine, involving intelligence sharing and advanced weaponry. However, under Trump's presidency, this partnership unraveled due to internal administration conflicts and Trump's personal approach to diplomacy, which prioritized his own leverage and perceived respect from leaders. Key figures like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance advocated for a shift in focus towards China, leading to a "de facto anti-Ukraine policy" characterized by delays and cuts in aid. Despite these internal struggles, secret CIA operations continued to support Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian energy facilities. Negotiations with Russia, conducted through both official and back channels, involved proposals for territorial concessions from Ukraine, including significant portions of Donetsk and Crimea. These negotiations were marked by a struggle to balance Trump's desire for a quick deal with Russia's maximalist demands and Ukraine's desperate need for continued support. Ultimately, the U.S. military's internal divisions and a "shadow ban" on certain munitions created a "de facto anti-Ukraine policy," hindering Ukraine's defense. While the CIA's covert drone campaign showed some success, the overall partnership was strained by conflicting priorities and a lack of clear strategy, leaving the fate of Ukraine uncertain.
