## Article summary
A newly unsealed court order in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia reveals that high-level Justice Department officials urged his prosecution, deeming it a top priority, only after he was mistakenly deported and subsequently ordered to be returned to the U.S. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges and is seeking to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive and intended to punish him for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation. U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw found some evidence of vindictive prosecution, citing a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that suggested the charges were filed because Abrego Garcia won his wrongful deportation case. The judge's order indicates that the decision to prosecute may have been a joint one, with the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee reporting to others in the Justice Department. Emails show that officials in the Deputy Attorney General's Office communicated with the U.S. Attorney's Office about the case, with one email stating that the prosecution was a top priority. The human smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop where Abrego Garcia was pulled over with nine passengers, but he was initially given only a warning. Despite the case being turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, there was no record of an effort to charge him until April 2025, several days after the Supreme Court ruled in his favor. A hearing on the motion to dismiss the case is scheduled for January 28.
