## Article summary
Tatiana Schlossberg, a grandchild of the late President John F. Kennedy, has died at the age of 35. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia last year. Schlossberg, who was the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, revealed her terminal cancer diagnosis in an essay published in The New Yorker in November 2025. In the essay, she detailed her battle with leukemia, including chemotherapy and stem cell transplants. Schlossberg also criticized policies promoted by her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., suggesting they could harm cancer patients. She had worked as an environmental journalist for The New York Times and authored the book "Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have." Schlossberg expressed fears that her children would not remember her and sadness over not being able to continue her life with her husband. Her family, including siblings Rose and Jack Schlossberg, is mourning her loss. The Kennedy family has experienced several tragedies, including the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, and the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash.
