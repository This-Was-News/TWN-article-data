## Article summary
Donald Trump's campaign pledge to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours proved to be an oversimplification of a complex geopolitical issue. Despite his initial ambition, Trump eventually acknowledged the difficulty of a swift resolution. His administration's approach was marked by internal divisions and external outreach, including attempts to secure a secret letter from Biden aides to facilitate early transition talks, which was refused. A back channel to Russia was opened through intermediaries like Steve Witkoff. Within the Pentagon, officials influenced by JD Vance sought to redirect military support away from Ukraine towards confronting China, leading to the withholding of crucial munitions. Trump's belief in his personal rapport with Vladimir Putin was misplaced, as Putin largely ignored his peace proposals. Meanwhile, the CIA and U.S. military secretly aided Ukraine in striking Russian oil refineries and shadow fleet vessels, significantly impacting the Russian economy. A personal connection between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky was fostered through a shared appreciation for Ukrainian women, humanizing their relationship.
