## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to continue seeking funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency the administration has been attempting to dismantle. The administration argued that the CFPB had no valid funds because its funding comes from the Federal Reserve, which was operating at a loss. Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected this argument, stating it would effectively shut down the agency. This ruling upholds a previous injunction aimed at keeping the CFPB operational as mandated by Congress. The CFPB, established after the 2008 financial crisis, protects consumers from fraud and predatory practices and collects complaints against businesses. It has been a target of conservatives who deem its enforcement too aggressive. The Trump administration had previously halted work at the agency and initiated layoffs, which have been subject to legal challenges. Notably, the CFPB's funding does not come from taxpayer dollars but has returned over $21 billion to consumers.
