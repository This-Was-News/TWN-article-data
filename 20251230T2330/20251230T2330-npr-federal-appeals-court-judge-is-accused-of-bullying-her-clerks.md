## Article summary
A nonprofit organization, the Legal Accountability Project, has filed a misconduct complaint against federal appeals court Judge Sarah Merriam of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. The complaint alleges that Merriam engages in bullying and mistreatment of her law clerks, citing conversations with multiple former clerks who fear retaliation. According to the organization's president, Aliza Shatzman, the alleged behavior includes yelling, berating clerks, and sending "all-caps unhinged emails." This is reportedly the second publicly known complaint against Merriam in four years, though such complaints are typically handled internally and kept confidential to protect judicial independence. NPR's investigation into the federal court system revealed a culture of fear regarding reporting judges and found that the internal system often fails to bring about significant change. A previous internal investigation into an unnamed 2nd Circuit judge in December 2023 found evidence of an "overly harsh" management style, leading to the judge agreeing to counseling and workplace conduct training. While the judge was not named, a legal commentator alleged it was Merriam, and the findings align with the recent complaint's details. The Legal Accountability Project stated that clerks in 2024 and 2025 reported abuses by Merriam, with some quitting or withdrawing job offers due to the alleged work environment. Judge Merriam, a former public defender and magistrate judge, was nominated to the District Court by President Biden in 2021 and promoted to the appeals court in 2022. This case highlights ongoing concerns about the power imbalance between federal judges and their clerks, who lack typical worker protections. The filing of this new complaint may lead to interviews with former clerks and the judge herself.
