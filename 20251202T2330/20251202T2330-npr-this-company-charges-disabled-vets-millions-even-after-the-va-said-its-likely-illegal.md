## Article summary
A company called Trajector Medical is charging disabled veterans millions for help with their VA disability claims, even after the VA warned them it might be illegal. The company uses a computerized system called "CallBot" to monitor VA hotlines and detect when a veteran's disability payments increase, at which point they send a bill, sometimes for as much as $20,000. Many veterans feel misled, stating they did most of the work themselves or that the company exaggerated their conditions. Trajector denies filing claims directly, stating they provide a "medical evidence packet," but evidence suggests they may be filling out and submitting forms through a related platform called "Benefit Karma." The VA has sent warning letters to Trajector in the past, but the company maintains it complies with the law. Some veterans are happy with the service, but many feel exploited, especially since free assistance is available through accredited veterans service organizations. Congress is considering legislation to either ban such companies or regulate their fees, with competing bills in the House and Senate. Trajector, founded with the mission to help veterans, has seen its focus shift from client assistance to aggressive debt collection, according to former employees who fear retribution for speaking out.
