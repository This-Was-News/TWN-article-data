## Article summary
Costco is pursuing refunds for tariffs imposed under President Donald Trump's administration, joining other companies in challenging these import taxes. Lower courts have previously ruled these sweeping tariffs illegal, and the case is now before the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, importers could be eligible for refunds on payments made. Costco has filed legal actions to secure its claim for potential refunds, concerned that the process of finalizing tariff bills by Customs and Border Protection might jeopardize their ability to collect. Other companies like Revlon and Bumble Bee Foods have made similar arguments. The tariffs in question have generated approximately $90 billion. The mechanism for processing such large-scale refunds remains unclear, as this scenario represents an unprecedented influx of refund requests. Trump has previously warned that losing these tariffs would severely damage the American economy.
