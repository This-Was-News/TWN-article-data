## Article summary
The publisher of the beloved children's book character Franklin the Turtle has strongly condemned Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for posting a meme that depicts Franklin firing a rocket-propelled grenade at drug boats. The meme, titled 'Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists,' was posted by Hegseth amidst growing scrutiny over the legality of U.S. strikes on suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean in September. Kids Can Press, the publisher, stated that the unauthorized and violent use of Franklin's image contradicts the character's values of kindness, empathy, and inclusivity. Hegseth has been accused of authorizing a second strike on a boat that killed surviving occupants, an action that could violate the laws of war, though he has denied these reports. Democrats, including Senator Mark Kelly and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, have criticized Hegseth's actions, with Schumer calling him a "national embarrassment." Both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have launched investigations into the September incident. While the White House initially stated that another military leader ordered the strikes, a U.S. official has disputed this account, claiming Hegseth commanded "two strikes to kill." President Trump has defended Hegseth but stated he would not make a decision on the matter as Hegseth claims he did not order the second strike.
