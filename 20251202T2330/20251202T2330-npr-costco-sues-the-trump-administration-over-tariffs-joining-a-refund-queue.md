## Article summary
Costco has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking a refund for tariffs paid if the Supreme Court deems them illegal. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing the legality of President Trump's tariffs on nearly all imports, with justices appearing skeptical during oral arguments. Lower courts had previously ruled that Trump exceeded his emergency economic powers in imposing these tariffs. Costco joins a growing list of companies, including Revlon, Bumble Bee, and Kawasaki, that have filed similar lawsuits to secure potential refunds. Trade law experts note that this marks a significant shift, with larger companies now publicly joining the legal action, which has largely been led by smaller businesses. While Costco did not disclose the total amount paid in tariffs, the company expressed concern about its ability to recover all funds even if the tariffs are overturned. Costco previously stated that approximately one-third of its U.S. sales consist of imported goods, primarily nonfood items.
