## Article summary
Pop singer Sabrina Carpenter and the publisher of Franklin the Turtle have publicly condemned the Trump administration for using their work to promote its agenda. Carpenter denounced the use of her song "Juno" in a video montage depicting Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, calling the video "evil and disgusting" and demanding her music not be associated with the administration's "inhumane agenda." Kids Can Press, the publisher of Franklin the Turtle, also condemned a post by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that featured a manipulated image of Franklin the Turtle aiming a bazooka, stating it contradicts the character's values. The administration has been conducting strikes against drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, resulting in numerous deaths. This is not the first time the Trump administration has faced objections from artists; a long list of musicians and performers, including ABBA, Bruce Springsteen, and Adele, have previously objected to their songs and copyrighted material being used by the campaign.
