## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended a follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean in early September, citing the "fog of war" and stating he saw no survivors in the water. Lawmakers are investigating the incident following a report that Hegseth issued a verbal order to kill everyone on the boat. This strike was part of the Trump administration's counterdrug campaign, which has involved over 20 strikes and more than 80 deaths. Legal experts suggest the second strike may have violated peacetime laws, and the Pentagon's own manual deems striking survivors of a sunken ship illegal. President Trump distanced himself from the secondary strike, claiming he lacked detailed information and relied on Hegseth. Hegseth stated that Trump empowers commanders to make difficult decisions. The Pentagon confirmed all strikes were presidentially directed and the chain of command functioned correctly. The administration suggested the admiral overseeing the operation made the decision for the second strike, an action the White House asserts was within his authority and the law. Admiral Frank Mitch Bradley is scheduled to brief lawmakers on the matter.
