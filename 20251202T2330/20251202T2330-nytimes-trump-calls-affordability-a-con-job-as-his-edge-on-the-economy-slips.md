## Article summary
President Trump has expressed frustration with the growing concern over affordability in the United States, dismissing it as a "con job" orchestrated by Democrats. During a cabinet meeting, he argued that the issue of affordability is a "fake narrative" designed to mislead the public, especially in light of his administration's claimed economic achievements like trillions in investments and record employment. Trump asserted that "affordability doesn't mean anything to anybody," and that he inherited an economy with the "worst inflation in history." He also reprised his criticisms of former President Joe Biden, blaming him for leaving a failing economy. However, by downplaying the persistent high costs that polls indicate Americans are experiencing, Trump risks a similar political misstep as Biden. Trump has often taken credit for lowering inflation, while simultaneously implementing policies, such as tariffs, that can contribute to increased costs. The article suggests that the issue of affordability is becoming a significant political challenge for Trump, potentially impacting upcoming elections.
