## Article summary
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, made his first court appearance in D.C. Superior Court, pleading not guilty to charges including first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill. He is accused of an ambush-style attack that killed West Virginia National Guard Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and wounded Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe near the White House. Beckstrom died from her injuries, while Wolfe remains in serious condition but shows some progress. Lakanwal allegedly screamed "Allahu Akbar!" during the attack. The incident has led to all National Guard members in D.C. being armed and an increase in deployed troops. Authorities state Lakanwal drove across the country from Washington state to commit the attack. A refugee volunteer described Lakanwal as withdrawn and potentially suffering a mental health crisis, not showing signs of radicalization. Beckstrom, who volunteered for the D.C. mission, is remembered for her commitment to serving others. Wolfe and Beckstrom were friends and had been deployed to D.C. in August. Lakanwal previously served in an Afghan counterterrorism unit and was resettled in the U.S. through Operation Allies Welcome. He reportedly struggled to adjust to life in the U.S., leading to isolation. The shooting has prompted the administration to pause visa reviews for Afghans and halt all asylum decisions, drawing criticism from veterans and refugee advocates who argue against punishing an entire community for one individual's actions.
