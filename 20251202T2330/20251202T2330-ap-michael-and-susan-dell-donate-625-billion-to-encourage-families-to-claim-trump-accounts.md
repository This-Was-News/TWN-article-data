## Article summary
Michael and Susan Dell have pledged $6.25 billion to encourage families to claim newly created investment accounts for children, dubbed 'Trump Accounts.' This historic gift, announced on GivingTuesday, is believed to be the largest single private commitment to U.S. children. The Dells' contribution will provide $250 to each qualified child under 11, supplementing the $1,000 the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit into these accounts for children born between 2025 and 2028. The Dells aim to foster hope and opportunity, believing this initiative will build prosperity for future generations. The Trump Accounts, established by President Trump's tax and spending legislation, are set to launch on July 4, 2026. Funds can be withdrawn by children at age 18 for education, home purchase, or starting a business. The Dells' contribution is targeted to ZIP codes with a median family income of $150,000 or less to benefit children who won't receive the Treasury's seed money. While this initiative aims to boost long-term savings, it does not immediately address current childhood poverty, which is exacerbated by cuts to social support programs also included in the legislation. Experts see potential for the Trump Accounts to evolve and become more inclusive over time, similar to other major social policies. President Trump praised the Dells' gift as one of the most generous acts in history and indicated he and others would also contribute.
