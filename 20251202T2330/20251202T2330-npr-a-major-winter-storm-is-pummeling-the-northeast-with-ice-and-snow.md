## Article summary
A major winter storm is currently impacting the Northeastern United States, bringing significant snowfall and icy conditions. This storm system, moving from Pennsylvania to Maine, is expected to drop at least 6 inches of snow in multiple states, potentially disrupting the Tuesday evening commute. Parts of Appalachia, particularly along the Virginia and West Virginia border, are bracing for widespread icing that could create hazardous road and sidewalk conditions. Governors in affected states are urging caution and preparedness, with Maine's governor advising residents to check on neighbors and New Jersey's governor declaring a state of emergency for several northern counties. This follows a weekend of heavy snow across the Midwest, where Chicago set a new November snowfall record and Milwaukee experienced significant accumulation. Forecasters predict that states like New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine could see at least half an inch of snow by Wednesday morning, with the heaviest snowfall anticipated in areas from the Poconos to coastal Maine. The storm is expected to move into Canada by Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, a separate winter storm system is forecast to bring snow to parts of Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming.
