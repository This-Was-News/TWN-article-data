## Article summary
The Trump administration is intensifying its deportation efforts against Afghan nationals following a recent shooting in Washington D.C. This crackdown, detailed in internal documents, involves locating and apprehending over 1,860 Afghans with final deportation orders. The directive to focus on Afghan nationals has been distributed to ICE field offices. Concurrently, officials are reviewing the vetting process for Afghans admitted to the U.S. The shooting suspect, an Afghan refugee named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was allegedly experiencing mental health issues stemming from his combat experience in Afghanistan. Mr. Lakanwal arrived in the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome and was granted asylum in April. While Biden administration officials assert that vetting was adequate, a Republican-cited inspector general report identified significant flaws. In response to the incident, the Trump administration has halted asylum requests and visa issuances for individuals from Afghanistan, and is reviewing previously approved asylum cases and green cards from certain countries. These actions could drastically alter U.S. immigration policy. Similar enforcement actions are also targeting Somali immigrants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, but the focus on Afghan refugees is particularly pronounced, with daily reporting requirements on arrests and removals. Critics argue these measures constitute collective punishment and a waste of resources, with one advocate calling it an inappropriate response to the crime.
