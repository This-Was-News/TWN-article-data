## Article summary
The Trump administration has threatened to withhold SNAP food aid from most Democratic-led states if they do not provide recipient data, citing the need to combat fraud. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated that cooperation is necessary to identify deceased individuals and those receiving benefits multiple times, claiming this data has already helped uncover significant issues in states that have complied. However, 22 states and the District of Columbia have sued to block the data request, arguing they already verify eligibility and that sharing sensitive data is inappropriate. California officials expressed skepticism about the administration's threats, calling the potential cuts "morally repugnant." A federal judge has temporarily barred the administration from collecting the information from the suing states. While the administration claims 29 states have complied, the exact number and the specific data provided remain unclear. Democratic officials have criticized the administration's actions, accusing it of political vendettas and making decisions that will harm families. SNAP has recently been in the spotlight due to expanded work requirements and a previous attempt by the administration to withhold November benefits during a government shutdown.
