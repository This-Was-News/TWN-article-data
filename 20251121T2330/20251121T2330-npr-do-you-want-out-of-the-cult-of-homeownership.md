## Article summary
The NPR podcast "It's Been a Minute" discusses the challenges millennials face in achieving homeownership and explores alternative perspectives on adulthood. Bill Pulte of the FHFA mentioned a potential plan for 50-year mortgage terms, but NPR's Scott Horsley expressed skepticism, calling it a superficial solution that could lead to paying more interest over a longer period and hinder wealth accumulation. Rhaina Cohen highlighted that homeownership remains a significant cultural marker of adulthood, offering security and a sense of belonging, even as other traditional markers like marriage and children become more optional. The podcast also delves into emerging trends, such as friends or relatives co-buying properties, with about 15% of homebuyers in 2024 opting for this route, driven by both affordability and a desire for companionship. Cohen shared anecdotes of people choosing co-buying not just for financial reasons but also to combat loneliness, as experienced during the pandemic. The discussion suggests a potential shift in how we define and achieve adult milestones, questioning the traditional "cult of homeownership" and exploring new possibilities for living arrangements and financial security.
