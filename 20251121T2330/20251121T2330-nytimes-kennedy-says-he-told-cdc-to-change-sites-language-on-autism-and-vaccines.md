## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated in an interview that he directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to alter its long-held stance that vaccines do not cause autism. This action highlights his intent to question scientific consensus and influence the health department's direction. While acknowledging that large studies have found no link between the MMR vaccine or thimerosal and autism, Mr. Kennedy cited a lack of comprehensive research on other childhood vaccines. He believes that definitive statements about vaccines not causing autism are unproven and used to placate parental concerns. Mr. Kennedy asserted that the claim 'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not scientifically supported. This direct intervention by a health secretary in scientific guidance is considered highly unusual, as such changes are typically initiated by agency scientists. Mr. Kennedy's involvement stems from his extensive history of vaccine activism and his deep focus on this issue amidst other pressing health matters.
