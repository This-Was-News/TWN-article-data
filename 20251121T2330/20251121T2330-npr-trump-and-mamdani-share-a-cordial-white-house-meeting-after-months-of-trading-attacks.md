## Article summary
New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is set to meet President Trump at the White House on Friday, marking their first face-to-face encounter. This meeting is significant as Trump has previously labeled Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, as a "communist" and a radical figure. Mamdani, however, has stated his intention to work with anyone to lower the cost of living for New Yorkers and has vowed to pursue all avenues to make the city affordable. Trump has been a vocal critic of Mamdani since his primary win, even threatening to cut federal funding to the city. Mamdani, in turn, has directly addressed Trump, signaling his determination to implement his progressive agenda. This agenda includes proposals such as freezing rent, making city buses free, and opening city-run grocery stores. The article highlights the contrast between Mamdani's progressive platform and Trump's conservative opposition. It also touches upon the national interest Mamdani's candidacy has garnered beyond New York. The upcoming meeting is framed as a pivotal moment, bringing together two figures with starkly different political ideologies.
