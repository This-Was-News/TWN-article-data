## Article summary
Representative Eugene Vindman has called for the declassification of a 2019 phone call between President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, stating that a classified transcript he reviewed would shock Americans. Vindman described the call as "disturbing," occurring after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, whose killing U.S. intelligence concluded the Crown Prince approved. He compared the significance of this call to the one between Trump and the Ukrainian president that led to Trump's first impeachment. Vindman made these remarks alongside Khashoggi's widow, expressing his motivation to speak out after Trump welcomed the Crown Prince to the White House. He believes Trump is attempting to rewrite history regarding the Saudi leader's involvement in Khashoggi's murder. Vindman, serving on the National Security Council during Trump's term, reviewed the transcript. He and other House Democrats have formally requested the release of the transcript. However, the push for declassification is considered unlikely to succeed. The announcement is seen as a move to increase political pressure on the president and maintain focus on Khashoggi's assassination.
