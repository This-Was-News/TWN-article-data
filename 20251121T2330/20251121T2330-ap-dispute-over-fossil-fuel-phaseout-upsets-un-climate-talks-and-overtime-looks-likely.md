## Article summary
The United Nations climate talks in Brazil, COP30, are nearing their end without a major agreement, with concerns that the conference may conclude with little accomplished. Brazil's proposed texts for the final stages of the talks have been criticized by numerous countries for failing to explicitly mention fossil fuels as the cause of global warming and for not outlining a clear path to transition away from them. Representatives from nations like Panama, the European Union, and small island states have voiced strong objections, with the EU stating they would not accept texts that lack scientific basis and a clear transition away from fossil fuels. The conference president, André Corrêa do Lago of Brazil, acknowledged the difficulties and shifted to smaller negotiating groups after initial plenary sessions stalled. A fire at the conference venue earlier in the week also caused delays, putting the talks behind schedule. Delegates are pushing for a more robust plan to phase out fossil fuels, building on a previous agreement from the Dubai talks, but face opposition from powerful oil-producing nations. Despite these challenges, some, like former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, have urged nations to stand firm against proposals perceived as influenced by oil-producing countries. The negotiations are likely to extend beyond the original deadline as countries grapple with these contentious issues.
