## Article summary
Democratic Congressman Jason Crow stated that President Trump's accusations of sedition against him and other lawmakers have led to multiple death threats. Crow, a former Army Ranger, was part of a video advising U.S. troops to refuse illegal orders. Trump responded on Truth Social, labeling their actions as seditious behavior punishable by death and sharing posts suggesting the lawmakers should be hanged. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, denied Trump intended to incite violence, emphasizing the importance of the military chain of command. Crow, however, asserted that he will not be intimidated by these threats. The video featured six Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds, all of whom had sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution. They aimed to remind active service members of their right and duty to disobey unlawful commands that violate the Constitution. Trump's posts also included accusations that the lawmakers' actions constituted insurrection and warranted indictment. Despite the threats, Crow remains resolute in his stance and commitment to constitutional principles.
