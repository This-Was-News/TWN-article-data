## Article summary
An Ohio police officer, Connor Grubb, has been acquitted of all charges, including murder, in the fatal shooting of Ta'Kiya Young. Young, a pregnant Black mother, was accused of shoplifting when the incident occurred in a supermarket parking lot on August 24, 2023. Grubb had approached Young's car after a report of theft, and bodycam footage showed Young refusing to exit the vehicle before it slowly rolled forward toward the officer. Grubb fired a single shot into her chest, fatally wounding her and her unborn child. The judge dismissed some charges related to the baby's death, stating prosecutors failed to prove Grubb knew Young was pregnant. The defense argued Grubb felt the car hit his legs and shins, and that he must live with taking a life. Young's family expressed devastation and vowed to pursue a civil lawsuit, with her grandmother lamenting the outcome as unjust. Attorneys for the family criticized the verdict as normalizing police misconduct and highlighted concerns about officers escalating minor incidents.
