## Article summary
President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a meeting at the White House, focusing on shared goals rather than their past criticisms of each other. Despite previous harsh words, Trump expressed praise for Mamdani and pledged cooperation, even stating he would be comfortable living in New York City under Mamdani's leadership. They found common ground on issues like housing affordability and the cost of groceries, mirroring themes from Trump's own successful campaigns. The meeting also touched upon crime in New York, with both agreeing on the need to reduce it. However, the meeting's impact was felt in the stock market, with Consolidated Edison Inc. (ConEd) stock dropping significantly after Trump's comments about the utility company's rates. In other news, Trump released a Ukraine-Russia peace proposal, which received cautious optimism from Russian President Putin but skepticism from some Republicans and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, who expressed concerns about the potential loss of dignity or a key partner for Ukraine. The Supreme Court is set to consider Trump's birthright citizenship restrictions, and the FAA issued a warning to pilots about flying over Venezuela due to security concerns. Additionally, the HHS announced a $100 million investment in mental health initiatives, and the IRS was ordered to stop sharing taxpayer information with ICE.
