## Article summary
State and local election officials from both major parties are preparing for potential interference in the upcoming midterm elections by a Trump administration. They are planning for various scenarios, acknowledging the unpredictability of what might occur. Officials are bolstering relationships with law enforcement and legal offices to resist any interference efforts. Concerns include potential executive actions to control voting processes, despite the Constitution granting states authority over elections. There are also worries about the possibility of federal troops being deployed to polling places, a scenario previously considered unlikely but now being contemplated. Furthermore, election officials are concerned about the difficulty in establishing trusted sources of information, as individuals with a history of spreading election misinformation have been appointed to prominent government roles. The Department of Justice has also made unprecedented requests to investigate voting machines and access voter data, raising alarms about federal overreach. Finally, cybersecurity measures for elections have been reduced, potentially making smaller counties more vulnerable to attacks.
