## Article summary
Federal agents have been conducting surprise raids across Chicago for nearly two months as part of the Trump administration's immigration agenda. These operations, often involving unmarked vehicles, have led to the apprehension of stunned individuals in various neighborhoods. Reports and videos indicate aggressive tactics, including agents striking restrained individuals, deploying tear gas near schools, and using pepper spray on onlookers. This has instilled a culture of fear, particularly in predominantly Latino communities, with many expressing shock at the agents' use of force. Operation Midway Blitz, initiated in early September, has resulted in over 3,300 arrests, including U.S. citizens. The raids have occurred randomly in both affluent and modest areas, targeting schools, workplaces, and public spaces like Millennium Park. In response, Chicago residents have united to document these events using their mobile phones, capturing instances such as a federal agent tackling a Black teenager in the East Side neighborhood, and tear gas deployment in the Lakeview area. Videos also show agents arresting a construction worker in Old Irving Park, and an incident in Evanston where an agent punched a restrained man, leading to protests from bystanders. The Department of Homeland Security and related agencies have not provided comments on these actions, though Trump administration officials have previously defended agent conduct.
