## Article summary
The fallout from Jeffrey Epstein's crimes continues to have global repercussions, impacting vulnerable victims, elite individuals, and institutions. Despite his death, Epstein's connections continue to affect academics, government leaders, royalty, journalists, and banks across borders and political parties, eroding public trust. Economist Lawrence Summers faced significant professional consequences, losing positions at OpenAI, the Center for American Progress, and Yale University due to newly released emails showing continued contact with Epstein. Harvard University is also conducting its own review, having previously accepted substantial donations from Epstein and granted him access to campus facilities. Prince Andrew of Britain has lost his royal title and home, facing scrutiny for his alleged involvement in Epstein's sex crimes and continued association after Epstein's conviction. This situation has threatened support for the British monarchy during a sensitive time for King Charles. President Donald Trump's image of control has been challenged as he navigated the release of Epstein-related files, ultimately signing a bill to make many of them public after a political struggle. Trump has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein's activities, even filing a defamation suit over a report about a birthday note. The legislation to release files, however, includes exemptions that shield some information from public view. The article highlights that victims, numbering over 1,000 according to the Justice Department, have borne the highest cost of Epstein's transgressions.
