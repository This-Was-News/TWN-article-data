## Article summary
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy has launched a new campaign called "The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You" to encourage better behavior among air travelers. The campaign features a public service announcement that contrasts the polite and well-dressed travelers of the 1960s with the disruptive behavior seen in airports and on planes today. Duffy's initiative aims to bring back civility by reminding passengers to use manners, respect others, and maintain self-control. The PSA specifically calls out issues like in-flight altercations, forgetting basic courtesies like "please" and "thank you," and failing to assist fellow passengers with luggage. Duffy expressed a desire to return to an era where travelers presented themselves with more respect, even suggesting a move away from wearing pajamas to the airport. This campaign comes shortly after the Transportation Department decided against a proposal that would have required airlines to compensate passengers for significant travel disruptions, a move seen as a rollback of passenger protections and a step away from holding airlines accountable for customer service.
