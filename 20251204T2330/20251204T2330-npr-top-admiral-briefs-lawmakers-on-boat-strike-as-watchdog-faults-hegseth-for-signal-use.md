## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced dual scrutiny as lawmakers were briefed on a controversial Sept. 2 strike on survivors aboard an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, while a Pentagon watchdog faulted him for using Signal to discuss U.S. airstrikes in Yemen. Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley, who oversaw the boat strike operation, briefed lawmakers in closed-door sessions. Democrats, including Rep. Jim Himes, expressed shock, viewing the video as evidence of the U.S. military attacking shipwrecked sailors, which Himes argued violates the laws of armed conflict. Conversely, Sen. Tom Cotton described the video as showing survivors attempting to salvage a drug-laden boat and deemed the strikes lawful. The boat strike incident has raised questions about whether it broke U.S. law or constituted a war crime, with President Trump stating he was unaware of the specifics of the second strike. Meanwhile, a Pentagon Inspector General report found that Hegseth violated policy by using the Signal app on his personal phone to share sensitive military plans regarding airstrikes in Yemen. The report concluded this action could have jeopardized servicemembers and the mission. Hegseth did not participate in the investigation, asserting the shared information was not classified. The Pentagon, however, characterized the report as a "TOTAL exoneration" for Hegseth, stating no classified information was shared and the matter is resolved.
