## Article summary
The Department of Justice has issued an internal memo instructing prison inspectors to stop using safety standards specifically designed to protect LGBTQ and intersex inmates. This directive, obtained by NPR, halts the evaluation of detention centers using criteria aimed at preventing sexual violence against transgender, intersex, and gender-nonconforming individuals. Advocates express concern that this change will significantly increase the danger for this vulnerable population. The memo states that these revisions are part of aligning federal standards with President Trump's executive order on "gender ideology extremism," which recognizes only male and female sexes. While the standards are being revised, facilities undergoing audits will not be assessed on these LGBTQ-specific safety measures. This move is the latest in a series of policy changes by the Trump administration that reduce protections for transgender individuals, including those in the military and minors seeking gender-affirming care. The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) mandates regular audits to ensure facilities prevent rape and harassment, and these audits are crucial oversight tools. Experts warn that removing these specific safety considerations will make prisons less safe for everyone, particularly the most vulnerable. Data from a 2015 survey indicated that LGBTQ prisoners were over six times more likely to be sexually assaulted than the general prison population. The DOJ previously cut funding to the National PREA Resource Center, the organization that trains auditors, citing a reallocation of funds away from priorities not aligned with the administration's goals. Despite the memo, the National Association of PREA Coordinators notes that current regulations technically remain unchanged until revisions are finalized, leading to potential confusion and a lack of consistent enforcement.
