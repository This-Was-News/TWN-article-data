## Article summary
The Trump administration is initiating a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a trade deal that replaced NAFTA. This process involves hearings where various stakeholders, including farmers, academics, and trade groups, are sharing their assessments and hoping to influence future negotiations with Canada and Mexico. While many acknowledge the USMCA's benefits, they also caution against actions that could jeopardize existing advantages. President Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with the deal, suggesting it may expire or be renegotiated, and has previously threatened to withdraw from such agreements. He views the USMCA as potentially disadvantageous to the United States, similar to other trade deals. The administration is considering splitting the three-country agreement into two bilateral deals, reflecting perceived differences in negotiations with Mexico and Canada. Industries like textiles and automotive are concerned about potential disruptions, with some advocating for the preservation of the current pact while others push for significant improvements. Farmers have mixed views, with some seeking more protection from Mexican imports. The USMCA itself is a complex document with provisions aimed at benefiting U.S. manufacturing and addressing labor standards, reflecting input from various interest groups.
