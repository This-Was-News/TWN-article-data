## Article summary
The Supreme Court has allowed Texas to use a congressional map favorable to Republicans in the upcoming elections, overriding a lower-court ruling that suggested the map discriminates based on race. This decision comes as a relief to Texas Republicans, as candidate qualifying for the March primaries has already begun. The Supreme Court's order temporarily halts the lower court's block on the map, pending a final decision. This redistricting plan, enacted last summer at President Trump's urging, was designed to give Republicans an advantage by creating five additional House seats. This move is part of a broader national redistricting battle, with other states like Missouri and North Carolina also enacting maps that favor Republicans. In response, California voters approved a measure to give Democrats more seats, and the Trump administration is challenging these maps. The Texas case involves a dispute between judges appointed by different administrations, with one judge concluding the map likely dilutes the political power of Black and Latino voters, while another strongly dissented, criticizing the ruling and its potential beneficiaries. The Supreme Court is also considering a separate case from Louisiana that could impact race-based districts under the Voting Rights Act, the outcome of which may affect the current redistricting landscape.
