## Article summary
The U.S. State Department has issued a directive to deny visas to individuals involved in fact-checking, content moderation, or other activities deemed "censorship" by the Trump administration. This policy primarily targets H-1B visa applicants, often employed in the tech sector. The memo instructs consular officers to scrutinize applicants' resumes, online profiles, and media appearances for involvement in combating misinformation, disinformation, or false narratives. The administration cites concerns that tech companies have unfairly targeted conservatives and that foreign nationals should not be allowed to "censor" Americans. Critics, including First Amendment experts, argue that this policy is incoherent and potentially unconstitutional, conflating essential trust and safety work with censorship. This directive follows previous actions, including the requirement for H-1B applicants to make their social media profiles public for review. The State Department maintains that it defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreign censorship.
