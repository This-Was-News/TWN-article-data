## Article summary
Investigative reports reveal that the intense U.S.-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, the most significant sea battle since World War II, contributed to a series of costly Navy mishaps. These incidents included a friendly fire event where the USS Gettysburg shot at two fighter jets, the USS Harry S. Truman colliding with a merchant vessel, and the loss of two other multimillion-dollar jets. The reports highlight that the constant missile attacks and operational demands severely stressed the Truman's crew, leading to sleep deprivation among top leadership and a sense of numbness or detachment in some sailors. These four preventable mishaps cost the Navy over $100 million and resulted in injuries, with several incidents hinging on split-second reactions. The collision with the merchant vessel narrowly avoided piercing a compartment filled with sleeping sailors, thanks to the quick actions of the ship's captain. Experts suggest these events serve as a wake-up call, indicating the Navy is unprepared for extended combat and is overextending its ships and personnel. The investigations found issues ranging from poor training and over-reliance on technology to unsafe speeds and maintenance failures, with redacted sections obscuring specific accountability actions. The high operational tempo and the constant threat of Houthi attacks were identified as significant challenges that strained readiness and preparation.
