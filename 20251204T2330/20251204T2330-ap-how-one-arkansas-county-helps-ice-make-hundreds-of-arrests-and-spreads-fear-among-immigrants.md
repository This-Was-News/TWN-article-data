## Article summary
Northwest Arkansas has become a significant area for immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, with Benton County partnering with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to facilitate hundreds of arrests. This collaboration, often stemming from traffic stops and arrests made at the county jail, has led to over 450 ICE arrests in Benton County alone from January to October. The county's 287(g) agreement allows deputies to screen jail inmates for immigration status, leading to their transfer to ICE custody. Those turned over to ICE have faced a range of charges, from minor offenses like driving without a license to more serious crimes. This trend is part of a nationwide expansion of similar partnerships between ICE and local law enforcement agencies, with over 1,180 agreements in place, an increase from 135 at the start of the administration. Arkansas, under a new law signed by Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, mandates county sheriffs to cooperate with ICE. Immigrants in the region report living in fear, avoiding leaving their homes for non-essential activities due to concerns of racial profiling and arrest. One woman, a legal permanent resident, was held on an ICE detainer after a traffic stop, despite having no criminal record, while her husband, who had entered the country illegally, was deported after being arrested on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge. The separation has had severe financial and emotional consequences for her and their children.
