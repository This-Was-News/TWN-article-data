## Article summary
A special election in Tennessee highlights the impact of partisan gerrymandering, where Republican Matt Behn won a U.S. House seat by 9 percentage points, a victory largely preordained by how the district was drawn. Following the last census, Republicans in Tennessee divided Nashville, a Democratic stronghold, into three Republican-leaning districts. This practice, often referred to as manipulative mapmaking, aims to help the party in power maintain or expand its majorities. Voters in the minority party express frustration over losing the chance to elect representatives of their choice. The redrawing of Nashville's districts, which flipped a Democratic seat to Republican control, is now being replicated in other states as former President Donald Trump advocates for mid-decade redistricting. States like Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have approved new maps to boost Republican chances, while Democrats have countered with their own gerrymandering in California. The stakes are high, as Democrats need a small gain to control the U.S. House. Indiana is considering a similar redistricting plan that could give Republicans a shot at winning all of its U.S. House seats, potentially splitting a Democratic-held district in Indianapolis and disenfranchising minority voters. Political scientists note that while such gerrymandering can achieve its intended purpose of increasing partisan representation, it may ultimately disadvantage voters in both urban and rural areas by diluting their voices.
