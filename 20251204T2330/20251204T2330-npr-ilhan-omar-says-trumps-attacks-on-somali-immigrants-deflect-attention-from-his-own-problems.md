## Article summary
President Trump has intensified his verbal attacks on Minnesota's Somali community, labeling immigrants from Somalia as "garbage" and claiming they have "destroyed our country." During a discussion about alleged fraud in Minnesota's social services, Trump also mentioned deporting Minnesota Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents a significant Somali American population. Omar, who immigrated to the U.S. as a child and is now a citizen, described Trump's remarks as "vile." She stated that the president's rhetoric is consistent with his long history of engaging in racism, xenophobia, bigotry, and Islamophobia throughout his time in office. Omar suggested that Trump's attacks serve to deflect attention from scrutiny he faces. She believes his comments are a tactic to distract from other issues and appeal to his base by targeting minority groups. The president's continued targeting of the Somali community highlights ongoing tensions surrounding immigration and xenophobia in the United States. Omar's response underscores the personal impact of such rhetoric on individuals and communities.
