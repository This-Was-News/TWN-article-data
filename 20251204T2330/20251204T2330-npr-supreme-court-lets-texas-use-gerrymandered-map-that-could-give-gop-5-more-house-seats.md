## Article summary
The Supreme Court has allowed Texas to utilize a newly drawn congressional map that could potentially secure five additional U.S. House seats for Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. This decision overrides a previous ruling by a three-judge panel that had blocked the map, finding it likely violated the Constitution by discriminating based on race. The panel had cited evidence suggesting lawmakers manipulated district demographics to disenfranchise Black and Latino voters, but Texas argued the redistricting was motivated by a desire to elect more Republicans rather than by racial bias. Justice Samuel Alito had initially allowed Texas to temporarily use the map while the Supreme Court considered the state's appeal. This development occurs amidst a broader trend of gerrymandering efforts across the country, with states like California, Missouri, Florida, Indiana, Virginia, and North Carolina also seeing new or contested congressional maps. A pending Supreme Court decision on a voting rights case concerning Louisiana's map could further influence the redistricting landscape nationwide, potentially enabling more Republican-friendly districts before the 2026 midterms.
