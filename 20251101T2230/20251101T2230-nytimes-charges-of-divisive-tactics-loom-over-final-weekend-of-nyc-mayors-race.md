## Article summary
The New York City mayoral race is heating up as Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic front-runner, and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo trade accusations of divisiveness. Mamdani alleges that Cuomo has amplified anti-Islamic attacks against him, while Cuomo claims Mamdani is the one creating divisions. Former President Barack Obama has called Mamdani to praise his campaign, signaling support beyond the election. Early voting is experiencing high turnout, with nearly half a million ballots cast by Friday night. Mamdani, focusing on his immigrant roots and South Asian support, held a rally in Queens, emphasizing community power. Meanwhile, Cuomo is campaigning in various boroughs, seeking to connect with voters. The Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, is trailing in third place. Muslim voters express both pride in Mamdani's potential historic win and fear due to the rise in Islamophobic rhetoric. Reverend Al Sharpton has condemned the Islamophobia in the race, calling it an attempt to link all Muslims to terrorism. Cuomo, in an interview, stated that diversity can be both a strength and a weakness in New York, while also condemning bigoted remarks. The election is set for Tuesday, with early voting concluding on Sunday.
