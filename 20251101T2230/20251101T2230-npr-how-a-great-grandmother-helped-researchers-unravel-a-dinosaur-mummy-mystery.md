## Article summary
Paleontologist Paul Sereno's research, published in the journal Science, has brought new clarity to the appearance of the duck-billed dinosaur *Edmontosaurus annectens*. To locate the original excavation site of a famous dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908, Sereno engaged in historical sleuthing and even consulted with local ranchers. His investigation led him to a rancher whose great-grandmother was the postmaster of a non-existent town on modern maps, which helped him pinpoint the mummy's discovery location. The "mummy zone" in Wyoming's badlands, characterized by a thick layer of river sand, has preserved dinosaur bodies, offering valuable insights. Sereno discovered that these mummies are essentially thin clay masks of the body, not replacements of the actual skin. This research provides a comprehensive view of the *Edmontosaurus* from head to toe, including details about its bill, hooves, crest, and tail spikes, though its color remains unknown. The study highlights two specimens: an adult nicknamed "Ed Sr." and the only known juvenile dinosaur mummy, "Ed Jr." Experts like Clint Boyd, paleontology program manager for the North Dakota Geological Survey, have praised the study for its thoroughness and its value as a baseline for future research. Sereno's work also represents a personal full circle, as a childhood visit to the very specimen that inspired his search ignited his passion for paleontology. He encourages aspiring young paleontologists, emphasizing that many dinosaur discoveries still await.
