## Article summary
Former President Barack Obama is actively campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidates Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, urging voters to elect them ahead of Tuesday's elections. These races are seen as potential indicators of the national political mood and could foreshadow the upcoming midterm elections. Obama's rallies contrast with Donald Trump's approach, as he has largely left Republican nominees Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia and Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey to campaign independently, though he has offered endorsements and conducted phone rallies. In Virginia, Obama criticized Trump's policies and character, emphasizing the importance of elections for the nation's democracy. Meanwhile, the Republican candidates are focusing on issues like energy costs and property taxes, with Ciattarelli also highlighting Sherrill's background and questioning its relevance to New Jersey's problems. The election outcomes could also shed light on the influence of social issues, such as abortion rights and transgender policies, on voters. Additionally, California voters are deciding on a referendum to redraw congressional maps, a move that could significantly impact the balance of power in the House of Representatives. Obama's involvement underscores his continued popularity among Democrats and the party's efforts to mobilize diverse coalitions, particularly in areas crucial for Democratic victories.
