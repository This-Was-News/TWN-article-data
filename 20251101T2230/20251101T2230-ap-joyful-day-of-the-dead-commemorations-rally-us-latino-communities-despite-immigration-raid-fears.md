## Article summary
Day of the Dead celebrations across U.S. Latino communities have taken on heightened significance this year, serving as a source of resilience and community pride amidst fears of increased immigration enforcement raids. Despite concerns that deportation fears might dampen public gatherings, participants turned out in large numbers. These celebrations, which blend joyful remembrance with a renewed sense of presence, honor both recent family deaths and ancestral ties. The tradition, rooted in Indigenous practices and influenced by Catholicism, involves creating altars with offerings of food, drinks, and favorite pastimes to welcome the souls of the departed. In cities like Minneapolis and Mankato, organizers emphasized the importance of continuing these cultural rituals, even in the face of anxiety. The festivities have also evolved into a public sphere, sometimes serving as a form of protest for marginalized victims. Altars in Minneapolis commemorated a range of losses, including victims of school shootings, border deaths, 9/11, the war in Gaza, and violence against Indigenous women. Organizers and participants expressed a strong sense of community and spiritual strength derived from these gatherings, highlighting the importance of remembering loved ones positively and feeling their presence.
