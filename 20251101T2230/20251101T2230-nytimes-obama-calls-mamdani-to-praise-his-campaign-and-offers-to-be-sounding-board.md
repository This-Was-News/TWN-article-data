## Article summary
Former President Barack Obama recently called New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to praise his campaign and offer future support. The approximately 30-minute private conversation, described by two sources, highlighted Obama's investment in Mamdani's success beyond the election. They discussed the challenges of staffing a new administration and building the necessary infrastructure to implement Mamdani's agenda. Obama admired Mamdani's campaign execution, noting his few missteps under intense scrutiny. While Obama has not formally endorsed Mamdani, adhering to his practice of avoiding municipal race interventions, this call signals his support. This is notable as other Democratic leaders have maintained a distance from Mamdani, a democratic socialist. Obama offered to be a sounding board if Mamdani wins and suggested a future in-person meeting. Mamdani expressed that Obama's past speeches inspired his own remarks on Islamophobia. This outreach comes as national Democrats have been reticent, with some, like Senator Chuck Schumer, still undecided on their stance, while others, like Representative Hakeem Jeffries, offered late endorsements. Republicans, however, have sought to link Mamdani nationally with socialism. Mamdani's campaign has drawn comparisons to Obama's 2008 run, with former Obama officials noting the shared sense of hope and excitement.
