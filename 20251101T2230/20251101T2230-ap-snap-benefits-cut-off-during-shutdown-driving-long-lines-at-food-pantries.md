## Article summary
SNAP benefits were cut off due to the government shutdown, causing long lines at food pantries nationwide. In the Bronx, a food pantry saw an unusual number of people, some arriving as early as 4 a.m. Volunteers and recipients alike expressed concern about how they would manage without the benefits. The Department of Agriculture had planned to withhold payments, but federal judges ordered them to be made. However, confusion remained about when the debit cards would be reloaded. A U.S. District Judge ordered the government to report on how SNAP accounts would be funded. The delay highlighted the financial vulnerabilities of many, with one food pantry director noting that the pantry now serves the whole community, not just the poor. Similar scenes of increased demand were observed in Georgia and Kentucky, with families worried about missing Thanksgiving benefits. Recipients expressed frustration with the decisions made in Washington and a desire for greater understanding of poverty's challenges. Food pantries are working to welcome newcomers and provide additional services, addressing the embarrassment and shame some may feel.
