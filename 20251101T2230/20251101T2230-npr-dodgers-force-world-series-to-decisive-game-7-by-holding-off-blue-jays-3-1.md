## Article summary
The Los Angeles Dodgers have forced a decisive Game 7 in the World Series by defeating the Toronto Blue Jays 3-1 in Game 6. Yoshinobu Yamamoto secured his second win against the Blue Jays, pitching six innings and allowing one run. The Dodgers established a 3-0 lead in the third inning, highlighted by Mookie Betts' two-run single. Rookie relievers Justin Wrobleski and Roki Sasaki combined for effective relief, before starter Tyler Glasnow entered from the bullpen to secure the win in the ninth inning. Glasnow's appearance was crucial, as he induced a pop-up and then benefited from a game-ending double play initiated by Kiké Hernández. This dramatic double play, the first of its kind in postseason history, preserved the Dodgers' lead. Max Scherzer is slated to start Game 7 for the Blue Jays, seeking their first World Series title since 1993. The Dodgers, aiming for their third title in six seasons, will rely on their pitching depth, with Shohei Ohtani also potentially playing a role. Mookie Betts, despite a slump, delivered a critical hit, expressing his determination to contribute to the team's success. The Blue Jays, who had won the previous two games in Los Angeles, were unable to secure the championship at home. The stage is now set for a thrilling Game 7 to determine the World Series champion.
