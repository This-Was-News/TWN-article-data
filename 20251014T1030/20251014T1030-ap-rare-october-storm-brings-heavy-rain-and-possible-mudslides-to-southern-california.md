## Article summary
A rare October storm hit Southern California, bringing heavy rain, high winds, and the risk of mudslides. Evacuations were ordered in wildfire-scarred areas like Pacific Palisades and Mandeville Canyon, which were devastated by a January fire. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass warned residents to stay alert and indoors, with the worst weather expected early Tuesday. The storm could bring up to 4 inches of rain and even tornadoes, with high winds posing additional risks. The National Weather Service described the storm as rare and potent, with unpredictable impacts. The Los Angeles Fire Department patrolled the area, and parts of state Route 27 were closed. Heavy rain also caused urban flooding in Northern California, and a restaurant along the Pacific Coast Highway closed in anticipation. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been high since the 2018 Montecito mudslides. Meanwhile, Typhoon Halong caused severe damage in Alaska, and a microburst in Tempe, Arizona, led to significant damage and power outages.
