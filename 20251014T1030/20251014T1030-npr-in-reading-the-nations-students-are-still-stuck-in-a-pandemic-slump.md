## Article summary
The nation's third- through eighth-graders are still struggling with reading, according to new data from NWEA's Spring 2025 MAP Growth assessment. Math scores show slight improvements but remain below pre-pandemic levels. The data indicates that reading scores have not improved since the pandemic, with students performing at or below pandemic-era lows. Math scores have shown slow but steady improvement since 2021, with gains across different student groups. NWEA has launched a new performance dashboard to help school leaders and policymakers track student progress. The dashboard will be updated more frequently than the Nation's Report Card, providing timely data to inform decision-making. Experts emphasize the importance of regular data checks to monitor student recovery. The Trump administration's cuts to the Institute of Education Sciences highlight the need for local data to guide academic interventions.
