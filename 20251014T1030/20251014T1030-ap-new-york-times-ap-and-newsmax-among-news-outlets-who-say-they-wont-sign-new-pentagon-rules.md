## Article summary
Several major news organizations, including The New York Times, The Associated Press, Newsmax, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, and Reuters, have refused to sign a new Defense Department document outlining press rules, risking the eviction of their reporters from the Pentagon. These outlets argue that the new policy threatens to punish routine news gathering protected by the First Amendment. The Pentagon's new restrictions include barring journalists from accessing large parts of the Pentagon without an escort and allowing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to revoke press access for reporters who seek unapproved information. Newsmax, despite generally supporting President Donald Trump's administration, called the requirements unnecessary and onerous. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell defended the rules as common sense media procedures, while Hegseth reposted critical comments about the journalists' stance. Reporters argue that signing the statement would imply that reporting unapproved information harms national security, which they deny. The Pentagon Press Association criticized the policy as vague and likely unconstitutional, emphasizing the public's right to know about government and military operations. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and news organizations, with Trump having filed lawsuits against several outlets and moved to restrict funding for government-run media services.
