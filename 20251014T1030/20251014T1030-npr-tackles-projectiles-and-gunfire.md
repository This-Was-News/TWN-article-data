## Article summary
The article discusses concerns about the increasing use of violent tactics by ICE officers, citing multiple incidents involving gunfire, pepper balls, and excessive force. Videos show officers pinning individuals to the ground, drawing weapons, and using pepper balls on bystanders and reporters. Critics argue that these tactics escalate tensions rather than de-escalate them. Recent surveys indicate that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics. Incidents include a massive apartment raid in Chicago and the shooting of a woman, with body camera footage contradicting official narratives. The ACLU of Illinois has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for violating protesters' constitutional rights. ICE claims officers are highly trained and act within the law, but reports suggest assaults on officers may be overstated. Former officials and experts argue that federal officers lack the training for urban policing and that excessive force is unnecessary. The use of force must be objectively reasonable and proportional to the threat, but critics question the social and democratic legitimacy of these actions. Immigrant rights groups urge bystanders to document incidents to hold officers accountable.
