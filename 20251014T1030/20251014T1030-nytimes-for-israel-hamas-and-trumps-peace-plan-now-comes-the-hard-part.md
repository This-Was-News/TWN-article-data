## Article summary
Hamas has released hostages and agreed to a cease-fire, but convincing them to disarm and demilitarize Gaza remains a significant challenge. The release of hostages and the cease-fire, achieved with the help of President Trump and other leaders, was the easier part. The harder task is ensuring Hamas gives up its weapons, a key precondition for Israel's full withdrawal from Gaza. President Trump's 20-point plan outlines a comprehensive solution, including an international security force, economic rebuilding, and a temporary Palestinian governing committee. The details of post-war governance were complex and deferred to a second phase of negotiations. In Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi gathered leaders to build on the momentum of the truce and hostage exchange. Trump announced the start of Phase 2, predicting significant progress and asserting that peace in the Middle East is achievable.
