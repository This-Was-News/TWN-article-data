## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced sweeping layoffs at the U.S. Department of Education, significantly impacting the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). The reduction-in-force (RIF) affects dozens of staff responsible for overseeing $15 billion in special education funding and ensuring states comply with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The layoffs, totaling 466 across the department, have raised concerns about the future of special education oversight and support for the 7.5 million children with disabilities in the U.S. Employees fear that key responsibilities, such as reviewing state plans and providing technical assistance, will go unmet. The cuts have been criticized as illegal, as federal law mandates the existence of an Office of Special Education Programs. The layoffs come amidst President Trump's push to return education to the states, raising questions about the future of federal oversight and the potential for inconsistent implementation of special education laws across states.
