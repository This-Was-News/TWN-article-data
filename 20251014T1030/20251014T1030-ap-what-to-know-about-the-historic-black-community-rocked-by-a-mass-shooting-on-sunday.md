## Article summary
A mass shooting occurred on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, home to the largest Gullah community in the United States. The Gullah, also known as Geechee, are descendants of enslaved Africans who retained much of their African heritage due to their separation from the mainland. They have a distinct language, food, music, and crafts rooted in African cultures. Approximately 5,000 Gullah people live on the island, which spans 140 square miles. The shooting took place at Willie's Bar and Grill, a community pillar that serves Gullah-inspired cuisine. The incident happened during a high school reunion, adding to the community's recent challenges, including hurricanes, aging infrastructure, and real estate development battles. The Gullah community has faced threats to its cultural preservation, making this tragedy even more devastating.
