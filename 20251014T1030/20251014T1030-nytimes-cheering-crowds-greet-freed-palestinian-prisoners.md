## Article summary
Cheering crowds greeted Palestinian prisoners released by Israel under a new cease-fire deal. Families in Ramallah eagerly awaited the arrival of buses carrying nearly 2,000 released prisoners and detainees. Among those freed were 250 Palestinians convicted of terrorism offenses and 1,700 detained in Gaza without charge. Many of the released prisoners appeared haggard and exhausted, with some requiring medical attention. The Israel Prison Service confirmed the release of all 1,968 Palestinians slated for exchange. Some families expressed mixed feelings, with joy for the released prisoners tempered by concerns about their health and the conditions of their release. The exchange included Palestinians convicted of attacks in the 1980s and 1990s, with over 150 sent into exile. The release was part of a broader prisoner-hostage swap, with Israel stipulating that no detainees suspected of involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks would be freed. The event was marked by both celebration and sorrow, as some families learned their loved ones were not among those released. The scene was one of joy, grief, and disbelief, with crowds gathering around hospitals and buses to welcome the returning prisoners.
