## Article summary
NPR is losing access to the Pentagon because they refuse to sign a new Defense Department document that restricts journalists from soliciting unclassified information. This policy would prevent them from doing their job effectively. Major news outlets, including NPR, the Washington Post, CNN, and the New York Times, have not signed the new rule. The author, who has held a Pentagon press pass for 28 years, emphasizes the importance of journalism in uncovering the truth behind official statements. Over the years, NPR has reported on various military operations and policies, often revealing discrepancies between official claims and ground realities. The author highlights the risks journalists face, including the loss of colleagues in combat zones. With the Trump administration providing minimal briefings, the author expresses concern about the lack of transparency and accountability in the Pentagon's operations. The author argues that a free press is essential for a functioning democracy and questions how the American people will stay informed without access to independent journalism.
