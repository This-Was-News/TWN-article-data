## Article summary
A fragile ceasefire in Gaza has led to the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, marking a significant but challenging step towards peace. The ceasefire, brokered by President Donald Trump, is seen as the end of the war in Gaza and the beginning of rebuilding efforts. However, the path to long-term peace and stability is fraught with uncertainties and potential pitfalls. Key details of the peace plan remain unsettled, including the disarmament of Hamas, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, and the establishment of a new security force. The plan also lacks clarity on the governance of Gaza and the response of its population. Experts warn that the ceasefire is fragile and that sustained effort and attention from the U.S. and other nations will be required to prevent a resumption of fighting. The legacy of conflict and deep distrust among the parties adds to the complexity. Despite optimism from Trump, skepticism remains due to the historical failure of U.S. attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The ceasefire is seen as a temporary pause, and its success depends on continued engagement from Trump and other actors. The Gaza Strip requires massive rehabilitation, with tens of thousands killed, over 90% of the population displaced, and widespread destruction. The cost of rebuilding is estimated at $53 billion, with wealthy Arab states expected to contribute. The biggest sticking point remains the issue of a Palestinian state, which Trump's plan holds out as a possibility only after a lengthy transition period.
