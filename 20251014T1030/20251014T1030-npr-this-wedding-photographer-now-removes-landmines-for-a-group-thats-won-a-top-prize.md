## Article summary
Mofida Majzoub, a former wedding photographer, now leads demining operations for the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) in Lebanon and Syria. Landmines, numbering around 110 million globally, pose a significant threat, causing over 5,700 casualties in 2023, mostly civilians. MAG, which has been operating for over 35 years in more than 70 countries, received a prestigious award for its humanitarian efforts. In Syria, where over 1,400 landmine casualties have been reported since the end of the civil war in 2024, Majzoub oversees demining teams. She describes the dangerous and meticulous process of detecting, disarming, and removing landmines, emphasizing the need for focus and discipline. Despite the risks, Majzoub finds fulfillment in making areas safe for people to return to their homes and lives. The work is extensive, with an estimated 10 to 15 years of effort still needed in Syria. Majzoub's dedication is driven by the satisfaction of saving lives and restoring safety to communities.
