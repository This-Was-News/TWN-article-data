## Article summary
Russian forces attacked Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, targeting a hospital and wounding seven people. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to request Tomahawk missiles. The Russian attack aimed at energy facilities, part of a campaign to disable Ukraine's power supply. Zelenskyy urged foreign countries to provide more air defense systems. Military aid to Ukraine dropped sharply in July and August. Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump will focus on potential U.S. provision of long-range weapons. Tomahawk missiles could allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russia. Ukrainian long-range attacks are impacting Russian oil production and causing gas shortages. The talks are expected to center on pushing Moscow into negotiations.
