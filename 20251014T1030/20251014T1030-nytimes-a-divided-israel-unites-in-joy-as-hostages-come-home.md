## Article summary
Israel celebrated the release of the last surviving hostages from Gaza, marking a moment of national unity and joy after years of polarizing war. The 20 living hostages, along with the remains of 28 deceased ones, were returned as part of a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Many Israelis had long hoped for this outcome, with polls showing a majority wanting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize their release. The hostages, who had become household names, were thinner but alive and on their feet, reuniting with their families amidst emotional scenes. The release was brokered by the Trump administration and signaled the end of the war. Israelis gathered in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and along roads to welcome the returnees, waving flags and cheering. The hostages were taken to hospitals for medical checks and reunions with family members. The release also included the exchange of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. While the living hostages are back, Israel is still awaiting the return of the remains of the deceased. The moment was seen as a time for healing and peace, both within Israel and with its neighbors.
