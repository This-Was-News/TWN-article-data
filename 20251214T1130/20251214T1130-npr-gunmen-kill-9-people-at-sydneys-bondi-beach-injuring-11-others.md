## Article summary
Nine people were killed and eleven others injured in a mass shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday. Police stated that two gunmen were involved; one was fatally shot by officers, while the second was apprehended and is in critical condition. The incident occurred during a Hanukkah celebration called "Chanukah by the Sea." Authorities are investigating suspicious items found at the scene. Dramatic footage captured a bystander disarming one of the gunmen. Emergency services responded rapidly to reports of gunfire. The New South Wales Premier described the events as "deeply distressing," and the Prime Minister echoed sentiments of shock and distress, commending the efforts of first responders. Mass shootings are exceptionally rare in Australia, with the country having enacted strict gun laws following a 1996 massacre. Previous significant mass casualty events this century have involved murder-suicides and extremist attacks.
