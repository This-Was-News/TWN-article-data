## Article summary
Two people were killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police are actively searching for the shooter, who remains at large. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon in the engineering building during final exams. Surveillance video shows the suspect, dressed in black, walking away from the scene, but their face is not visible, and it's unclear if they are a student. Witnesses described the suspect possibly wearing a camouflage mask. University President Christina Paxson stated that all ten shooting victims were students, with one in critical condition and others requiring intensive care. The campus and surrounding neighborhoods were under a shelter-in-place order as hundreds of officers conducted a massive search. Students hid in classrooms and other buildings for hours. The shooter is believed to have used a handgun. Governor Dan McKee vowed to deploy all available resources to apprehend the suspect. The Brown community and the city of Providence are in shock and mourning following the tragic event.
