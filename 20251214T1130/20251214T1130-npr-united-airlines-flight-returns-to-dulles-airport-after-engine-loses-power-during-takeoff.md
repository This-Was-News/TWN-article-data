A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo, Japan, safely returned to Dulles International Airport in Virginia on Saturday after experiencing an engine failure shortly after takeoff. The plane, a Boeing 777-200ER, was carrying 275 passengers and 15 crew members. According to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, a piece of the engine cover separated and caught fire, igniting a brushfire on the ground. No injuries were reported among the passengers or crew.
