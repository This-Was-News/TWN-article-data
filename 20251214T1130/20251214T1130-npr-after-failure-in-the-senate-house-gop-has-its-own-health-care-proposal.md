## Article summary
Following the failure of health care proposals in the Senate, House Republicans have introduced their own legislation. This new proposal, released late Friday, does not extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year, potentially causing significant premium increases for millions. Instead, the Republican plan focuses on allowing small businesses to pool together for insurance and aims to lower drug costs by regulating pharmacy benefit managers. Starting in 2027, federal payments would be made to reduce premiums for some low-income individuals, though health plans covering abortion would be excluded. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated the proposal addresses key drivers of health care costs to improve affordability, access, and choice. However, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the plan as "toxic" and "deeply unserious" for not extending the ACA tax credits. Previous Senate efforts to extend these subsidies, supported by some Republicans, also failed to gain enough votes. Former President Trump has suggested directing funds directly to individuals for healthcare costs rather than using ACA tax credits. While the Senate GOP's proposal included health savings accounts, the House version does not. Some Republicans are concerned that ending ACA subsidies could negatively impact their party in upcoming elections, with some House members seeking to force a vote on extending these subsidies despite party leadership opposition.
