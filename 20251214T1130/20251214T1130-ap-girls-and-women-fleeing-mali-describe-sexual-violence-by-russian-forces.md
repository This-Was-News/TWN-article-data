## Article summary
Girls and women fleeing Mali are reporting sexual assaults by Russian forces, specifically members of Africa Corps, a new military unit under Russian control. The Associated Press gained rare access to a refugee camp in Mauritania where these testimonies were shared. One harrowing account involves a 14-year-old girl who was raped by Africa Corps fighters after witnessing them behead her uncle. She later collapsed from infection and shock, and her family, lacking funds, could not immediately seek medical attention. Aid workers confirm that while sexual violence is prevalent in Mali's conflict, shame and fear prevent many victims from coming forward, making accountability difficult. Other refugees also shared experiences of attempted rape and violence by armed "white men," believed to be Africa Corps. These allegations echo past reports of sexual abuse by the Wagner mercenary group, which Africa Corps replaced. The UN reported a mass rape in Moura village in 2023, involving Malian troops and "armed white men." The Malian government's expulsion of the UN peacekeeping mission has further hindered data collection on conflict-related sexual violence. Aid organizations express deep concern over the escalating violence and disregard for human life, noting the psychological toll on survivors and the difficulty in providing adequate care and support in the current climate.
