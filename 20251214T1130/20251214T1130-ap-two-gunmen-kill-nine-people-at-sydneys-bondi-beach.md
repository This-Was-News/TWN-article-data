## Article summary
In Sydney, Australia, at least 11 people were killed and 29 injured during a shooting at a Jewish event on Bondi Beach. Authorities have declared the incident a terrorist attack, targeting the local Jewish community during a Hanukkah celebration. One gunman was killed by police, and a second suspect was arrested and is in critical condition. A suspicious device was also found in one of the suspect's cars. This event is particularly shocking in Australia, where mass shootings are rare due to strict gun laws enacted after a 1996 massacre. Witnesses described a chaotic scene of panic and flight as shots were heard. The Prime Minister expressed his condolences, and emergency services responded swiftly. The investigation into the attack is ongoing, with specialist officers examining the scene and recovered items.
