## Article summary
Anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies are intensifying across Europe, with right-wing parties gaining popularity and mainstream politicians adopting tougher stances on migration. This trend is fueled by a combination of factors including economic stagnation since the 2008 financial crisis, the rise of nationalist politicians, and the polarizing influence of social media. In the UK, there's a notable increase in national division and decline, exacerbated by the Brexit debate and the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media platforms, particularly X, are criticized for promoting divisive content. Ethnonationalism is being promoted by parties like Germany's AfD and France's National Rally, with rhetoric that echoes concerns from the Trump administration about immigration threatening national identities. Policies once considered extreme, such as stripping immigrants of permanent-resident status, are now on the political agenda. Hate crimes are on the rise in the UK, and protests against asylum-seeker accommodation have turned violent in Ireland and the Netherlands. Some politicians are criticized for using language that echoes far-right sentiments, leading to calls for calmer rhetoric. Human rights advocates warn that appeasing the right may lead to increasingly extreme policies.
