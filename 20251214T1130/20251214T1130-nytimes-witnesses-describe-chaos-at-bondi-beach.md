## Article summary
Chaos erupted at Bondi Beach in Sydney during a Hanukkah celebration when gunshots were fired, sending attendees fleeing. Authorities reported at least 12 fatalities, including one of the alleged shooters. Ebonny Munro, who was with her baby, described the event as a family gathering with bubbles and music before the shooting began. She took shelter under a barbecue, smelling gunpowder and witnessing at least one person being shot. The shooting continued for approximately 10 minutes. Finn Foster, a tourist, initially mistook the gunshots for fireworks before witnessing panicked crowds running from the beach. People were seen jumping over cars and scaling walls while pulling their children. The identities of the victims have not yet been released by the police. However, the head of the local Chabad organization stated that one of their emissaries was among those shot. As night fell, many people were still sheltering in nearby businesses.
