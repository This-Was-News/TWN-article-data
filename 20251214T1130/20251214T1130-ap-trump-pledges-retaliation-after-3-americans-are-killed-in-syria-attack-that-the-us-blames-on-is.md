## Article summary
President Donald Trump has pledged severe retaliation following an attack in Syria that resulted in the deaths of two U.S. service members and one American civilian. The United States attributes this attack to the Islamic State group (IS). Trump stated that the attack was an IS act against the U.S. and Syria in a volatile region. He also mentioned that Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa expressed devastation and anger over the incident, emphasizing Syria's cooperation with U.S. troops. Two of the fallen soldiers were identified as members of the Iowa National Guard. U.S. Central Command confirmed that three service members were wounded in the ambush by a lone IS member, and the gunman was killed. The Pentagon identified the civilian killed as a U.S. interpreter and stated the attack targeted personnel involved in counter-terrorism operations. The attack occurred near Palmyra, and Syrian authorities are investigating the gunman's potential links to IS and extremist ideology. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed that anyone targeting Americans would be hunted and killed. The U.S. maintains a presence of hundreds of troops in eastern Syria to combat IS, and this incident marks the first fatalities since the fall of President Bashar Assad a year prior. Despite IS being largely defeated on the battlefield, its sleeper cells continue to carry out attacks, with an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 fighters remaining in Syria and Iraq.
