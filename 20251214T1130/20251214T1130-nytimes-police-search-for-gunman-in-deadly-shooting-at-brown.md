## Article summary
Law enforcement is searching for a gunman who killed two students and injured nine others in a shooting at Brown University on Saturday. The attacker, who wore a face mask and carried a rifle, entered a first-floor classroom in the engineering building during a final exam review session and began shooting before escaping. Officials have released a video of a person leaving the scene and are appealing for public assistance in identifying the suspect, who remains at large. The injured students were taken to a hospital, with several in critical condition. The shooting caused widespread disruption, with the campus and surrounding areas placed on lockdown and many businesses closing early. Some students at the university had previously survived other school shootings, highlighting the profound impact of such events. The incident occurred in the Barus and Holley engineering building, which was accessible due to final exams. The university's open campus layout may have facilitated the suspect's escape onto Hope Street. The event has deeply affected the Brown community, with students and faculty expressing shock and distress.
