## Article summary
The Trump administration is making the U.S. citizenship test more difficult. Starting October 20, new applicants will have to answer more questions correctly during the civics interview, which now includes tougher questions about U.S. history and politics. The test will also assess applicants' 'good moral character' and their positive contributions to society. Advocates argue that these changes will make the naturalization process more challenging, especially for those with low literacy levels. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow claims the current test is too easy, while Professor Amanda Frost argues there's no evidence the existing process is flawed. The changes are part of broader efforts to limit immigration. The new test aims to ensure immigrants are 'fully assimilated' and will contribute to America's greatness. Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, highlighting their positive impact.
