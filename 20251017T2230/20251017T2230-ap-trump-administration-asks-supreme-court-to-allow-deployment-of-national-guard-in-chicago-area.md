## Article summary
The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, intensifying a dispute with Democratic governors over military use on U.S. soil. This request follows a judge's order temporarily halting the deployment of Guard members from Illinois and Texas to aid immigration enforcement. The conservative-leaning Supreme Court has frequently sided with Trump in emergency appeals, allowing policies like the ban on transgender individuals in the military and aggressive immigration enforcement. Judge April Perry found no evidence of impending rebellion in Illinois during Trump's immigration crackdown, but the administration argues her order undermines presidential authority and endangers federal personnel. Recent protests in Broadview, near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, have been tense, with law enforcement using tear gas and chemical agents. Similar disputes over National Guard deployments have arisen in Oregon and California, where a judge ruled the deployment illegal. Currently, Guard troops are also active in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee.
