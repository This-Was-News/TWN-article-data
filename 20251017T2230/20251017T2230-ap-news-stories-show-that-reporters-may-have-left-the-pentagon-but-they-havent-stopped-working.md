## Article summary
After journalists left the Pentagon over disputed reporting rules, they continued working, relying on sources to cover U.S. military actions and leadership changes. The Pentagon's new rules, seen as restrictive by journalists, led to a mass departure, with only 15 reporters signing the new policy. Despite the exit, reporters like Nancy Youssef of The Atlantic continued their work from nearby locations. Concerns were raised about reduced access to military sites and operations, as well as potential chilling effects on source relationships. Some mid-level service members pledged to continue providing information, citing constitutional values. The dispute highlights tensions between press freedom and government control over military reporting.
