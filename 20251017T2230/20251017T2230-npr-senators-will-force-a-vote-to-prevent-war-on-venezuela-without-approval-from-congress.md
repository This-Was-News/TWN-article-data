## Article summary
Senators are pushing for a vote to prevent President Trump from declaring war on Venezuela without congressional approval. Sen. Tim Kaine, along with Sens. Adam Schiff and Rand Paul, introduced a resolution to force a Senate vote on the matter. Concerns about imminent military action are growing due to recent U.S. strikes and covert operations in the region. Trump has authorized CIA operations and is considering land operations in Venezuela. Kaine and Schiff previously forced a vote to limit Trump's war powers in the Caribbean, which failed but gained some Republican support. Paul has criticized the strikes, emphasizing the need for public debate and constitutional deliberation. The senators hope to garner more Republican support for the new resolution. The administration has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the strikes, which lawmakers believe are illegal and unconstitutional. Trump has ordered multiple military strikes on alleged drug boats, resulting in reported casualties. The outcome of the upcoming vote remains uncertain.
