## Article summary
President Donald Trump indicated to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he is unlikely to sell Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles, despite earlier suggestions. Zelenskyy proposed a deal where Ukraine would provide advanced drones in exchange for the missiles, which Ukraine sees as crucial for compelling Russia to engage in serious peace talks. Trump expressed reluctance to deplete U.S. missile supplies and preferred the war to end without the need for such weapons. He called for both sides to halt fighting and declare victory, with history deciding the outcome. Zelenskyy agreed on the need for a ceasefire and negotiations but did not fully endorse Trump's call for an immediate end to the war. The meeting between the two leaders lasted over two hours, longer than planned, and followed a lengthy phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy praised Trump's recent ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, suggesting he now has the momentum to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Trump's shifting stance on the Tomahawks disappointed Ukrainians, as they had hoped for U.S. support to strike deeper into Russian territory. Putin warned that supplying Tomahawks would damage U.S.-Russia relations. Ukrainian officials argued that the threat of such strikes could push Putin towards negotiations. This was the fourth face-to-face meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, with plans for further talks in Hungary involving Putin and their senior aides.
