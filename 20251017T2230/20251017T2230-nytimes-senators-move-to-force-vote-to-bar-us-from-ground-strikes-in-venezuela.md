## Article summary
A bipartisan group in the Senate is pushing for a vote on legislation to prevent the U.S. from engaging in hostilities inside Venezuela without congressional authorization. The measure, led by Senators Tim Kaine, Adam B. Schiff, and Rand Paul, aims to curb President Trump's escalating military actions against Venezuela. The Trump administration has conducted strikes on boats allegedly transporting drugs and has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The administration claims these actions are justified due to the flow of drugs and migrants into the U.S. However, the Senate has not been briefed on the covert C.I.A. operations in Venezuela. The measure faces opposition from most Republican lawmakers, but a vote would put Congress on record regarding the president's military campaign. Senators express concerns about the lack of congressional approval and the potential for an all-out war. The White House maintains that the president's actions are within the laws of armed conflict. The bipartisan measure seeks to attract more Republican support to rein in the administration's military actions.
