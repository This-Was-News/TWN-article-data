## Article summary
OpenAI's ChatGPT will soon allow erotic conversations for verified adults, following CEO Sam Altman's announcement. This move comes as the AI industry increasingly explores sexual content, with early adopters facing legal and societal challenges. Altman emphasized setting boundaries similar to R-rated movies, allowing adult freedom while restricting access for teens. The decision could help OpenAI monetize its service, as paid subscriptions are currently focused on professional use. Research indicates a significant market for AI chatbots designed for romantic or sexual bonding, with concerns about the impact on real-world relationships. OpenAI faces lawsuits related to AI chatbot misuse, including one involving a minor's suicide. Other companies like Civitai and Nomi.ai have also ventured into mature AI content, encountering abuse and regulatory pressures. Civitai initially allowed mature content but faced backlash and engagement drops after implementing stricter measures. Nomi.ai's chatbots are designed for adult users and platonic relationships, though some users may engage in erotic conversations. Altman's announcement follows California Governor Gavin Newsom's veto of a bill aimed at restricting AI chatbots for minors, with tech companies introducing new age restrictions and parental controls.
