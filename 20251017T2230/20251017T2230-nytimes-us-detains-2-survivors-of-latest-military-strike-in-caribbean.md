## Article summary
The U.S. Navy has detained two survivors from a military strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean, presenting legal and policy challenges for the Trump administration. The strike, part of a six-week campaign targeting suspected drug runners, marks the first time the military has held prisoners under this context. The administration faces decisions on whether to release, prosecute, or detain the survivors indefinitely. The strike killed two others, bringing the total deaths in such operations to at least 29. The survivors' nationalities remain unknown. The Trump administration has not publicly addressed the survivors' fate. Legal experts note the complexities of detaining them, including potential judicial scrutiny and the need to comply with international law. The administration could transfer the survivors to Guantánamo Bay, but this raises broader legal risks and could lead to court challenges. Prosecuting the survivors also presents challenges due to potential lack of admissible evidence. The administration's actions are part of a broader campaign against drug cartels, which it has labeled as terrorist organizations.
