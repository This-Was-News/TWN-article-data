## Article summary
Organizers of the No Kings protests expect millions of Americans to march against the Trump administration's policies this weekend. The protests coincide with National Guard deployments in several cities and ongoing ICE arrests. Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, emphasizes solidarity and defense of democracy. Republicans criticize the protests as anti-American, while protesters highlight issues like immigration, healthcare, and election integrity. The No Kings website states opposition to Trump's perceived absolutism. The White House dismisses the protests. Harvard sociologist Liz McKenna notes past protest movements' impact but acknowledges recent inefficacy in achieving goals. Despite this, organizers aim to show resilience against the administration.
