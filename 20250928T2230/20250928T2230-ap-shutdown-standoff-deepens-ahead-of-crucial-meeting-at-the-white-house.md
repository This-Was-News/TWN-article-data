## Article summary
A government shutdown standoff is intensifying between Senate Democrats and Republicans ahead of a crucial meeting at the White House. Republicans insist Democrats must help pass a short-term funding extension to avoid a shutdown, while Democrats demand immediate negotiations on healthcare. Both sides are unwilling to compromise, with Republicans blaming Democrats and Democrats accusing Republicans of inaction. The Senate is expected to vote on a House-passed funding bill on Tuesday, but Republicans may need Democratic support to pass it. Democrats, emboldened by their base, are willing to shut down the government to fight against Trump and Republican policies. Meanwhile, concerns over expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits and potential federal worker layoffs add urgency to the negotiations. The White House has warned of mass firings if a shutdown occurs, while Republicans argue the healthcare program needs reform. Democrats hope for a serious negotiation at the rescheduled White House meeting, but tensions remain high as the deadline approaches.
