## Article summary
President Donald Trump will address a hastily convened meeting of top military leaders at Quantico, Virginia, on Tuesday, as reported by a White House official. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth summoned hundreds of senior commanders, including generals and admirals, from around the world with little notice. Trump, who initially seemed unaware of the meeting, decided to attend, though his participation was not part of the original plan. He plans to discuss the military's success and positive developments. The meeting's purpose was initially unclear, but Trump's involvement raises concerns about politicizing the nonpartisan military audience. Trump has previously made campaign-style remarks to military personnel and has deployed troops to various cities, including Portland and Los Angeles, often over local objections. The Pentagon confirmed Hegseth's address to senior military leaders. The meeting includes 800 generals and admirals stationed globally. The Washington Post first reported on Trump's attendance.
