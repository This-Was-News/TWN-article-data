## Article summary
Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, has faced significant legal and political challenges, including corruption investigations involving his close allies. His former chief adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, her son, former state senator Jesse Hamilton, and two influential supporters were charged with orchestrating a bribery scheme across several city agencies. This is the second time Lewis-Martin has been charged with corruption in less than a year. Adams himself was indicted on criminal charges last fall, accused of abusing his office for personal gain, including obtaining free and discounted travel and illegal foreign campaign contributions. These legal troubles have caused chaos in city government, led to a drop in Adams' approval ratings, and alienated many Democrats. The situation has created a complex web of legal and political issues surrounding the mayor and his associates.
