## Article summary
New York City Mayor Eric Adams has abandoned his reelection campaign, acknowledging he was no longer a viable contender due to a year of scandal and political turmoil. In a social media video, Adams reflected on his tenure but admitted that a dismissed federal corruption case and media speculation hindered his campaign's viability. He did not endorse any remaining candidates but warned against divisive agendas. Adams' withdrawal could benefit former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a fellow centrist, though it's unclear if Adams' supporters will shift to Cuomo. State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, aims to lower the cost of living in New York City. Cuomo praised Adams for prioritizing the city's well-being, while Mamdani criticized Cuomo's political comeback. Republican Curtis Sliwa remains in the race despite internal party challenges. Adams' campaign was plagued by corruption probes and scandals, including resignations of key officials and federal charges. Despite achieving some successes, such as reducing crime rates, Adams' administration was marred by controversies. His warm relationship with President Donald Trump and the dismissal of his corruption case by the Trump administration added to the political turmoil. Adams' decision to skip the Democratic primary and run as an independent further complicated his campaign.
