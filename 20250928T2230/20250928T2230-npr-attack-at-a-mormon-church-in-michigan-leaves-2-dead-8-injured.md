## Article summary
On Sunday morning, a gunman attacked a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints service in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, killing two people and injuring eight others. The suspect, 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, rammed his vehicle into the church and opened fire with an assault rifle. Police believe he also set the church on fire. Officers quickly responded and neutralized the suspect in the parking lot. One victim is in critical condition, while seven are stable. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expressed her condolences, and former President Trump offered FBI support. Police are investigating the motive and searching the suspect's residence and cellphone records. Church spokesperson Doug Andersen condemned the attack, calling it a tragic act of violence and emphasizing that places of worship should be sanctuaries of peace.
