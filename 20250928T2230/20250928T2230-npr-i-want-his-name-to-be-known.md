## Article summary
Stephany Gauffeny, the wife of Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, speaks to NPR about her husband's critical condition after a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility on September 24. Garcia-Hernandez, an undocumented immigrant detained for driving under the influence, is on life support, and Gauffeny fears he may not survive. She expresses her anguish, especially as she is pregnant with their fifth child. Gauffeny describes the difficulty of visiting her husband, who remains in ICE custody and is shackled despite his condition. She criticizes the government's delay in identifying the victims and emphasizes her husband's kind nature, sense of humor, and dedication to his family. Garcia-Hernandez was a house painter and a loving father to their four children. Gauffeny is concerned about her family's future, as her husband was the main source of income. The family is relying on a GoFundMe campaign to cover expenses. Gauffeny hopes for her husband's recovery but acknowledges the grim reality.
