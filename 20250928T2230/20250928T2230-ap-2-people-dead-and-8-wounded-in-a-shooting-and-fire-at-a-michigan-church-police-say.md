## Article summary
A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service, killing two people and injuring eight others before police shot him. The suspect, identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, from Burton, rammed a pickup through the church's front door and set the building ablaze. Police responded within 30 seconds and killed the shooter about seven minutes later. One of the wounded was in critical condition, and seven others were stable. Investigators are searching the suspect's residence and have not yet determined a motive. The incident is the latest in a series of shootings at houses of worship in the U.S. President Donald Trump and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expressed condolences and condemned the violence. The church is near residential areas and another place of worship. The shooting occurred the day after the death of Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Mormon church. The community is in shock, with nearby nurses leaving a picket line to assist first responders.
