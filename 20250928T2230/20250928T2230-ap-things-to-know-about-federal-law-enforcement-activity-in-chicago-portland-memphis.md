## Article summary
Armed federal agents patrolled Chicago's downtown streets, escalating an immigration enforcement crackdown following President Trump's announcement to send troops to Portland. In Chicago, dozens of federal agents in tactical gear walked through tourist and shopping areas, amid a surge in immigration enforcement and conflicts at an ICE building in Broadview. Trump directed the Department of Defense to provide troops to protect ICE facilities in Portland, facing pushback from Oregon's Democratic governor. The moves follow Trump's crime crackdowns in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. In Memphis, federal authorities, including immigration and drug enforcement agents, are expected to arrive, with concerns raised by Latinos about increased ICE presence. Chicago's mayor and governor criticized the federal show of force, calling it intimidation. Protests and conflicts have occurred outside the ICE building in Broadview, with agents using pepper balls and tear gas. Oregon officials rejected Trump's claims of domestic terrorism, asserting the city is managing fine. Memphis officials clarified that National Guard members will not be armed unless requested and will not make arrests. Protesters in Memphis and Oregon called for more funding for education and crime prevention instead of federal troop presence.
