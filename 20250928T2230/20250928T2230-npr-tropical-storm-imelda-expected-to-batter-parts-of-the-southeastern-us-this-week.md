## Article summary
Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to impact parts of the southeastern U.S. this week, bringing significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency in preparation. The storm, upgraded from a tropical depression, is currently affecting the Caribbean and is forecasted to intensify into a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday. Areas along the East Coast, including Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, are preparing for harsh conditions, with tropical storm watches issued. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warns of potential flash flooding and dangerous marine conditions. The region has largely been spared severe storms this year, but past hurricanes like Helene have caused significant damage. Climate change is making hurricanes more severe, with hotter ocean temperatures fueling stronger storms. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 led to improved understanding and preparedness for such events.
