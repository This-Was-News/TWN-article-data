## Article summary
The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is confronting its violent anti-immigrant history with a new monument. In 1885, a mob of European migrants burned down Chinatown and killed 28 Chinese people, one of the deadliest incidents of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history. Researchers from Grinnell College are excavating the site, uncovering artifacts from the burned-down buildings. The town, known for its diverse immigrant history, has long celebrated its multicultural roots with an International Day. Recently, a new statue, 'Requiem,' was unveiled to commemorate the massacre's 140th anniversary. The bronze statue depicts a Chinese miner amidst the ruins, holding a ceremonial dragon flag. Despite the town's conservative leanings, the mayor and local students supported the monument. The town's growing acknowledgment of its past comes amid increased immigration enforcement. Descendants of the massacre victims, like Ricky and Grace Leo, returned to participate in the commemoration. The event included lion dancers, name recitations, and lectures, bringing together descendants and the community to honor the victims. The monument serves as a long-overdue recognition of a dark chapter in the town's history.
