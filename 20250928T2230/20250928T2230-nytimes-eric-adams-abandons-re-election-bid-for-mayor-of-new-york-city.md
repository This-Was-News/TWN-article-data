## Article summary
Mayor Eric Adams of New York City has abandoned his re-election bid just five weeks before Election Day, citing media speculation and the denial of public matching funds for his campaign. In a video message, Adams conceded he could no longer see a path to re-election and blamed external forces for his campaign's struggles. He warned voters about growing extremism in city politics without naming his Democratic rival, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. Adams also criticized former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, though these comments were cut from the final video. His decision ends weeks of speculation and negotiations, including talks about a potential ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia, which fell through. Adams's name will remain on the ballot, and his exit signals the likely end of his decades-long political career. The move could reshape the race, with Cuomo and Mamdani vying for support. Adams had initially promised to continue campaigning despite scandals, a federal indictment, and poor poll numbers, but ultimately decided to step aside.
