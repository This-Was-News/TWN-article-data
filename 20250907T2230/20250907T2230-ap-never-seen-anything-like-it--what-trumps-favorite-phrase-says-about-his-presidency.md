## Article summary
President Donald Trump frequently uses the phrase 'never seen anything like it' to describe various aspects of his presidency, from missile defense systems to economic growth. This hyperbole reflects his black-and-white worldview, where he sees himself as the hero and his political opponents as villains. His use of extreme language translates into his governance style, demanding extreme responses to every situation. The phrase has been used 194 times this year, far outpacing previous years in office. Trump's loose relationship with facts is well-documented, with his ghostwriter coining the term 'truthful hyperbole' to describe his exaggerations. While some of his claims are accurate, others are not, such as his statements on inflation and immigration. The phrase has become a fixture in his events and is spreading through his administration, with top advisers adopting similar language. Trump also attributes the phrase to others, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, to emphasize his impact.
