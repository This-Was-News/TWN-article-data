## Article summary
A young Philadelphia Phillies fan was gifted special baseball treats after a home run ball was taken from him during a viral dispute. Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader hit a home run during a game against the Miami Marlins, with the ball landing near a woman. A man grabbed the ball and gave it to the young boy, but a woman, dubbed 'Philles Karen,' confronted the man, claiming the ball was hers. The man eventually gave the ball to the woman. The Phillies and Marlins teams acknowledged the excitement for young fans in such situations. A Marlins staffer gave the boy a gift bag filled with swag and wished him a happy birthday. After the game, Bader met the young fan, gave him an autographed bat, and the Phillies won the game 9-3.
