## Article summary
By age 40, over half of Americans have high blood pressure, often undetected, earning it the nickname 'the silent killer.' New guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend early treatment, including lifestyle changes and medications, when systolic blood pressure rises above 130/80 mm Hg. Hypertension is a leading cause of heart disease, kidney disease, and dementia, with potential damage to small blood vessels in the brain linked to cognitive decline. Early treatment can significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other complications. The guidelines emphasize a low-sodium diet, exercise, limiting alcohol, and stress reduction through practices like meditation or yoga. For those with systolic blood pressure in the 130s, lifestyle changes are recommended first, followed by medication if necessary. For those with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 140 or higher), starting on high blood pressure medications is advised. Despite awareness, many struggle to manage their blood pressure due to medication side effects, lifestyle challenges, and individual differences. A new class of medication targeting the hormone aldosterone shows promise in lowering blood pressure, with a study indicating a 10-point improvement in systolic blood pressure over placebo. This reduction is linked to a 20% decrease in the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia.
