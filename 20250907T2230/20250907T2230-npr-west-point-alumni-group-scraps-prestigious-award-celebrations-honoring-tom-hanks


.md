## Article summary
The West Point Association of Graduates has canceled the official ceremony and parade honoring Tom Hanks as the 2025 recipient of the prestigious Sylvanus Thayer Award. The decision was announced internally by the association's president, Mark Beger, citing the Army's need to focus on its core mission. Hanks, known for his support of veterans, was praised for his contributions to the portrayal of American service members and the care of veterans. The award, established in 1958, is the highest civilian accolade given by West Point and has previously been awarded to notable figures from various backgrounds. The cancellation comes amid broader changes at West Point, including the elimination of student clubs for women and minority students following a Trump administration crackdown on diversity programs. Hanks has been a public supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, which may have influenced the decision. Retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Ty Seidule noted that the award ceremony is typically uncontroversial and rarely canceled, suggesting political motivations behind the decision. Despite the cancellation, the Sylvanus Thayer Award remains a significant honor recognizing individuals who have made substantial contributions to the nation.
