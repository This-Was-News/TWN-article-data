## Article summary
Russia launched its largest drone assault on Ukraine to date, targeting a government building in Kyiv's heavily guarded district for the first time since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia deployed 805 Iranian-designed Shahed drones and 13 cruise and ballistic missiles, with some evading defenses and causing impacts. President Trump expressed frustration with President Putin's unwillingness to soften maximalist demands for a settlement, despite ongoing bombardment of Ukraine. At least five people were killed, including a woman and child in Kyiv. European leaders condemned the attack, with Ursula von der Leyen calling it a mockery of diplomacy. The assault came days after European leaders proposed a framework for post-war security guarantees. Russia has escalated drone attacks, producing about 2,700 Shahed-type drones monthly. Despite peace efforts, Russia continues its offensive, demanding territorial concessions and a cap on Ukraine's military. Trump has threatened sanctions but has not followed through, with deadlines passing without consequence.
