## Article summary
A peace vigil that had stood outside the White House for over four decades was dismantled on Sunday after President Donald Trump ordered its removal as part of efforts to clear homeless encampments in Washington, D.C. The vigil, started in 1981 by activist William Thomas to promote nuclear disarmament, was believed to be the longest continuous anti-war protest in U.S. history. Philpos Melaku-Bello, a volunteer who had manned the vigil for years, stated that the Park Police justified the removal by mislabeling it as a shelter. He emphasized that the vigil was protected under the First Amendment and not an encampment where people live. The White House confirmed the removal, citing it as a hazard to visitors. This action is part of a series of measures by the Trump administration to oversee policing in the city, aimed at fulfilling an executive order on beautifying D.C. Melaku-Bello is consulting attorneys, viewing the removal as a civil rights violation and alleging it was done to fit Trump's agenda. The vigil was brought to Trump's attention during a White House event, where conservative correspondent Bran Glenn described it as an eyesore and misrepresented it as rat-infested and a national security risk. Despite these claims, no weapons or rats were found during the dismantling.
