## Article summary
Russia has intensified its disinformation efforts while the Trump administration has dismantled U.S. countermeasures. Moldova, a small European nation, is a key target, with Russia aiming to influence its upcoming parliamentary elections. The Kremlin has launched an intense campaign, flooding social media with fake content and using advanced AI tools. Fake posts and videos have spread across platforms like TikTok, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. One notable example involved impersonating OK! magazine to smear Moldova's president, Maia Sandu. Under the Biden administration, U.S. officials previously pushed back against such campaigns, urging platforms like Meta to identify and combat trolls. However, this resistance has ceased under Trump. The Trump administration has also cut diplomatic and financial support for Moldova's fight against Russian influence. This shift highlights the growing challenge of combating foreign disinformation without strong U.S. involvement.
