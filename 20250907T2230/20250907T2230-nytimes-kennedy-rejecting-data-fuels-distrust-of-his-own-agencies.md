## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Health Secretary, has been rejecting his department's COVID-19 data, claiming uncertainty about death counts and denying issues with vaccine accessibility. He has also asserted that mRNA vaccines cause serious harm, despite the CDC's findings to the contrary. His critics argue that his lack of medical or scientific training and his conspiracy-minded approach have undermined public health agencies, particularly the CDC. Kennedy's distrust of his department's scientists and doctors has led to turmoil, including mass firings and restructuring. He has accused agency scientists of malpractice and stonewalling vaccine safety data requests. Experts warn that his actions are fueling mistrust in public health institutions. Kennedy's supporters share his suspicions of organized medicine, while his detractors question his credibility. His stance on vaccines has led to conflicting policies across states, with Republican states loosening requirements and Democratic states tightening them. A recent poll shows that only 37% of the public trusts Kennedy as a source of vaccine information. His dismissal of expert opinions and misrepresentation of data have further eroded public confidence in health agencies.
