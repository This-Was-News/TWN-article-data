## Article summary
Chicago churches are urging calm resistance as the city prepares for expected federal intervention. The Rev. Marshall Hatch advised congregants at New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church to stay connected and protest peacefully. Churches across Chicago are addressing fears of increased law enforcement and deportations. President Trump has threatened federal intervention in Chicago, citing crime and deportation efforts, despite objections from local leaders and residents. The threat has heightened tensions, particularly in Black and Latino communities with fragile trust in police. Details of the intervention remain sparse, but federal law enforcement action is expected this week. The Trump administration has targeted Chicago's sanctuary laws, which limit local cooperation with immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security plans to use a military base and a federal processing center for a potential 45-day operation. Churches are also reminding people of their rights during interactions with immigration agents. The expected operation has dampened celebrations and raised fears in immigrant communities.
