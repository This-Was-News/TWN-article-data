## Article summary
Florida's plan to drop school vaccine mandates will not take effect for 90 days and initially covers only chickenpox and a few other diseases. The state's health department confirmed this after Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced the change, making Florida the first state to make vaccinations voluntary. This move contradicts decades of public policy and research supporting vaccines as safe and effective. The plan removes mandates for hepatitis B, chickenpox, Hib influenza, and pneumococcal diseases, but other vaccines like measles, polio, and tetanus remain required unless updated by lawmakers. The rule change was noted on September 3, 2025, with the public school year already started. Lawmakers will not meet again until January 2026, though committee meetings begin in October. Ladapo emphasized parental choice, stating that parents should decide what goes into their children's bodies. Florida already has a religious exemption for vaccine requirements. Health experts warn that making vaccines voluntary puts students and staff at risk, especially with rising cases of measles and whooping cough. The World Health Organization reported that vaccines have saved at least 154 million lives globally over the past 50 years, mostly infants and children.
