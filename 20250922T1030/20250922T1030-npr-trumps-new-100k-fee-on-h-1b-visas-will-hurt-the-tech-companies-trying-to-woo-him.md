## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, impacting tech companies that rely heavily on this program for hiring high-skilled foreign workers. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase have urged their employees to return to the U.S. before the new rule takes effect. The H-1B program, which allows 85,000 visas annually, is used by various industries, including tech, finance, and retail. The White House claims the program has been exploited to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign labor, a critique supported by some economists and politicians. While some experts cautiously support the change, immigration-focused groups argue it will undermine job creation and competitiveness. The new fee is seen as a setback for tech companies that have tried to align with Trump's policies, highlighting the challenges they face in currying favor with the administration. Despite their efforts, including attending White House events and donating to inaugural funds, tech leaders are facing increased difficulties in operating under Trump's policies.
