## Article summary
The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has sparked two main reactions among Republicans: a commitment to continue his political work and a push to blame left-wing extremists. At Kirk's memorial service, his widow, Erika, emphasized forgiveness and love, while President Trump praised Kirk's character but disagreed with his views on opponents. Kirk's legacy as a youth organizer has grown, with increased interest in his Turning Point group. Republicans like Vice President Vance and Tucker Carlson have vowed to advance his causes. Meanwhile, Trump and other Republicans have escalated rhetoric against left-wing groups, with some calling for retribution and others comparing Kirk's killing to Sept. 11. Online voices on the right have demanded consequences for those criticizing Kirk. Additionally, concerns about political violence, immigration, and the economy have led to a decline in Republican optimism about the country's future.
