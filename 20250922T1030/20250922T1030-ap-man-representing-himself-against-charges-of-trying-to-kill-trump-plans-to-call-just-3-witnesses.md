## Article summary
Ryan Routh is representing himself in federal court after being charged with attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course in 2024. Prosecutors allege Routh spent weeks plotting the attack and aimed a rifle at Trump but did not fire. Routh has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer. He plans to call just three witnesses, including a firearms expert and two character witnesses, and may not testify himself. Routh's defense is expected to take less than a day. Prosecutors have presented 38 witnesses over seven days. Routh previously expressed dissatisfaction with his court-appointed attorneys, claiming they did not believe in his defense. The trial is progressing faster than anticipated, with closing arguments scheduled for Tuesday. Routh has a history of violent behavior and was previously arrested for barricading himself with weapons and possessing stolen items. He also faces state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.
