## Article summary
France and Saudi Arabia are pushing for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the United Nations General Assembly, aiming to establish a Palestinian state in territories Israel seized in 1967. Several Western countries, including Britain, Canada, and Australia, have formally recognized a Palestinian state, joining nearly 150 others. However, the U.S. and Israel oppose this, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatening unilateral actions like annexing parts of the West Bank. The ongoing war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' attack in October 2023, has devastated the region, displacing 90% of its population and causing widespread famine. A French-Saudi plan proposes a phased solution, including an immediate ceasefire, hostage returns, and Israeli withdrawal, followed by Palestinian elections and international assistance. However, the plan faces significant hurdles, including opposition from Netanyahu's government, Hamas' refusal to disarm, and the Palestinian Authority's unpopularity. The U.S. and Israel argue that recognizing a Palestinian state rewards Hamas and complicates peace efforts. Despite international support, the plan's success remains uncertain, with past efforts often failing due to deep-seated conflicts and political divisions.
