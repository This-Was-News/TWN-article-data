## Article summary
Russia and Ukraine exchanged accusations of deadly drone strikes on civilian areas, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy anticipating intense diplomacy at the U.N. General Assembly. Zelenskyy has proposed a ceasefire and a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Moscow has objected to some proposals, leaving an end to the conflict uncertain. International concerns have grown over the potential spread of the war beyond Ukraine's borders, with incidents including Russian drones in Poland and fighter aircraft in Estonian airspace. Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics warned that Russia is testing NATO's response and aiming to reduce Western support for Ukraine. Zelenskyy plans to attend the U.N. General Assembly to rally support against Russia's invasion, with a busy schedule of meetings, including one with U.S. President Donald Trump. He emphasized the need for strong global resolve to achieve peace. Zelenskyy reported that Russia launched over 1,500 drones and 50 missiles at Ukraine in the past week, with many components sourced from foreign countries. Ukraine has pushed for stricter sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Russian airstrikes killed three people in Zaporizhzhia, while Ukrainian drones struck the resort of Foros in Crimea and the Belgorod region, causing casualties. Both sides claimed the other targeted civilian areas.
