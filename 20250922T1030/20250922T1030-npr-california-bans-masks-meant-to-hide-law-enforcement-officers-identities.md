## Article summary
California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning law enforcement from wearing masks on duty, except for specific cases like riot gear, medical masks, and undercover work. The law, called the 'No Secret Police Act,' aims to address concerns about federal agents operating in masks during immigration enforcement, which has led to protests in cities like Los Angeles. Newsom criticized the use of masks by federal agents, calling it a sign of growing authoritarianism and a tactic to terrorize diverse communities. The law will take effect next year, but its enforceability on federal agents is unclear. University of California, Davis law professor Raquel Aldana noted that the law attempts to establish limits on federal government actions within the state, citing state sovereignty. Other states, including New York and Massachusetts, are considering similar legislation. ICE officials have stated that masks are worn to protect agents from being identified and threatened online. Newsom also signed additional bills requiring law enforcement to display their names or badge numbers and prohibiting ICE agents from entering schools and healthcare facilities without valid warrants. Local law enforcement organizations opposed the bill, arguing it could endanger officers and their families. Despite potential legal challenges, advocates like Giselle Garcia from NorCal Resist believe the law provides a basis for litigation against federal government abuses.
