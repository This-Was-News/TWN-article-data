## Article summary
The United Nations General Assembly is marking its 80th anniversary amid deep crises, including deadlocks over Russia's war against Ukraine and Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. The U.N. faces financial cutbacks, particularly from the United States, which has reduced funding and withdrawn from key organizations like the World Health Organization and UNESCO. The U.N.'s top humanitarian official warns of a 'perfect storm' of underfunding, overstretch, and attacks on aid workers. The Trump administration has rejected the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals and disrupted various U.N. initiatives. Meanwhile, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom have recognized a state of Palestine, a move opposed by the U.S. and Israel. Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, will address the assembly, marking the end of Syria's diplomatic isolation. China is gaining influence as the U.S. withdraws, though it is not providing significant financial support. President Trump is expected to address the assembly, promoting his peace efforts, though his claims of resolving multiple wars have been disputed. The assembly will bring nearly 150 heads of state and government, offering opportunities for dialogue and mediation.
