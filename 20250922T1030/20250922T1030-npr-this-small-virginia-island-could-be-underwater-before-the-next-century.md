## Article summary
Tangier Island, Virginia, is at risk of being underwater within the next 50 years due to climate change, rising sea levels, and erosion. The island, known for its crabbing culture and unique accent, has lost two-thirds of its landmass since 1850. Climate change is accelerating erosion and increasing the frequency and intensity of storms, while the entire Chesapeake Bay region is sinking tectonically. The population has decreased by 30% since 2022, with many young people leaving the island. Despite global attention and some political support, the island has received limited help, with projects like seawalls and jetties taking decades to complete. Climate researcher Dave Schulte estimated that protecting and restoring the island would cost between $250 to $350 million. Mayor James 'Ooker' Eskridge emphasizes the importance of preserving the island's culture and way of life. Nearby Poplar Island, Maryland, serves as a model for habitat restoration and climate adaptation strategies. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation is working with Tangier to develop an adaptation plan to protect the island from climate change impacts.
