## Article summary
European nations are increasingly vocal in their criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza and are considering recognizing Palestine as a state, but concrete actions remain limited. While the European Union has proposed higher tariffs on Israeli goods and some countries have taken steps like banning arms sales, these measures have had little impact on the war. Efforts to aid Gaza have been insufficient, and asylum seekers from the region face significant barriers. Belgium, for instance, has a relatively permissive immigration policy but has closed its evacuation list and many asylum applications have been rejected. The European Union's attempts to impose sanctions on Israel have stalled due to opposition from countries like Germany, which has a complex historical relationship with Israel. Despite growing public opinion against Israel's conduct, political alliances and histories have hindered more substantial actions. Some nations, like Spain and Belgium, have taken individual steps, but these have not significantly altered the situation. The European Union is now pushing to suspend part of its trade agreement with Israel, but this requires a large majority and is not guaranteed. The overall challenge remains turning words of condemnation into effective action.
