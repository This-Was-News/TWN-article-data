## Article summary
Finland's President Alexander Stubb believes a ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before spring and urges European allies to maintain their support, despite a corruption scandal in Kyiv. He emphasizes the need for 'sisu'—Finnish for endurance and resilience—to navigate the ongoing conflict and Russia's hybrid warfare. Stubb, who shares a long border with Russia, plays a key role in communicating between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He highlights Finland's historical experience with Russia and its shift to NATO membership following the 2022 invasion. Stubb leverages his relationship with Trump to advocate for Ukraine, suggesting pressure on Russia through frozen assets and increased military aid. He acknowledges Zelenskyy's need to address corruption allegations swiftly, as they benefit Russia. Stubb believes Trump's engagement with Putin is crucial, while also noting the broader Russian hybrid war tactics targeting Europe. He advises a cool, calm, and collected approach, embodying the spirit of sisu, to counter these threats. Stubb admires Zelenskyy's leadership during wartime and maintains a pragmatic approach to the complex negotiations, focusing on security guarantees and a potential ceasefire.
