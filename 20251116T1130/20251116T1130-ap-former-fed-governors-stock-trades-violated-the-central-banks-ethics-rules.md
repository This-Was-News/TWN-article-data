## Article summary
A former Federal Reserve governor, Adriana Kugler, has been found to have violated the central bank's ethics rules through her stock trades in 2024. These violations, detailed in a report by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, include trading during blackout periods when the Federal Reserve's policymaking committee meets. Kugler, who retired in August, disclosed trades in companies such as Southwest Airlines, Apple, and Caterpillar. The Federal Reserve prohibits its officials from investing in individual stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies, allowing only diversified investments like mutual funds. Officials must also provide advance notice and approval for trades. Kugler's disclosed transactions included a sale of Palo Alto Networks stock and purchases of Cava Group stock within a week of Fed meetings. She also sold Southwest Airlines stock during a blackout period before a Fed meeting in April 2024. The report notes that some trading activity was carried out by Kugler's spouse without her knowledge, and she stated her spouse did not intend to violate any rules. The Federal Reserve implemented stricter ethics rules in 2022 following previous controversies over questionable trades by officials. Kugler was the first Hispanic Fed governor and has since returned to the Georgetown faculty.
