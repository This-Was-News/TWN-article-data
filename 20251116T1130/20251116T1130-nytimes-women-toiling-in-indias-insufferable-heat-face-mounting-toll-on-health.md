## Article summary
Women in India are facing severe health consequences due to prolonged exposure to heat stress, a danger exacerbated by increasingly frequent and intense heat waves. Kantaben Kishen Parmar, a vegetable seller in Ahmedabad, experiences daily temperatures around 105 degrees Fahrenheit while working long hours, leading to health issues like dehydration, urinary tract infections, and heavy bleeding. These conditions are often linked to heat stress by medical experts. Millions of Indians working in the informal sector, including farmworkers, waste collectors, and garment stitchers, are particularly vulnerable as they often toil outdoors or in poorly ventilated spaces. The rising temperatures and extended heat seasons are taking a significant toll on their health and livelihoods, with limited options for relief or protection. The article highlights the personal struggles of women like Ms. Parmar, who have no choice but to endure these harsh conditions. Scientists and doctors are increasingly concerned about the long-term impacts of heat stress on this population. The issue underscores a critical public health challenge in India, amplified by climate change.
