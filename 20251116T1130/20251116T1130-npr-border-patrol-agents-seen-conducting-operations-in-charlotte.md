## Article summary
U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents conducted arrests along Charlotte's Central Avenue and South Boulevard corridors on Saturday, November 15, 2025, targeting areas with significant immigrant populations. These operations led to businesses closing early and prompted a protest in uptown Charlotte where hundreds gathered to condemn the federal immigration agents' presence. Witnesses reported agents in uniform, some in unmarked cars, making stops and arrests, with one business owner describing the detention of her asylum-seeking mechanic. The arrests preceded a protest where chants of "No justice, no peace, no ICE or police" were heard. Charlotte officials had previously expressed concerns about the deployment, fearing it would cause "unnecessary fear and uncertainty" and citing instances in other cities where individuals without criminal records were detained. While Democratic leaders in Charlotte stated the Border Patrol was not needed, Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Tim Moore, expressed confidence in federal law enforcement. CBP Commander Greg Bovino defended the agency's actions, asserting they target "illegal aliens" and not legal immigrants. The Mecklenburg GOP criticized Democratic officials for allegedly prioritizing "political theater" over public safety. The duration and scope of the Border Patrol's operations in Charlotte remain unclear.
