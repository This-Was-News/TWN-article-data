## Article summary
Jeffrey Epstein's recently released emails offer a glimpse into a bygone era of New York's elite, a world of powerful figures and exclusive gatherings that has largely vanished. The documents span from around 2009 until his arrest in 2019, revealing the financier's connections to media moguls, politicians, and socialites. This clubby environment, where print media held significant sway, began to erode with the rise of the internet and the #MeToo movement. The emails show Epstein and his contemporaries reacting to these societal shifts, with some appearing to struggle with the changing landscape. Figures like Woody Allen, Donald Trump, Matt Lauer, and Harvey Weinstein are mentioned in correspondence related to events and media dealings. Publicists and journalists like Peggy Siegal and Michael Wolff are frequently featured, attempting to manage Epstein's public image and navigate the media. The fallout from the #MeToo movement is evident, as many of the men mentioned faced accusations and public scrutiny. Despite attempts to control his narrative through digital consultants and media outreach, Epstein's reputation continued to decline. The emails highlight the interconnectedness of power, media, and influence in a New York that is now a relic of the past, with many of the individuals involved having since left the public stage or faced significant repercussions.
