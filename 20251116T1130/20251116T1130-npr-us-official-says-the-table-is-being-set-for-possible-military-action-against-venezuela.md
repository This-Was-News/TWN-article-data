## Article summary
A U.S. military official has indicated that preparations are being made for potential military action against Venezuela, stating that the 'table is being set.' The world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, is set to arrive in the northern Caribbean, joining 15,000 service members. This deployment occurs amidst growing tensions and ongoing military exercises involving high-level meetings with Congress and foreign leaders. While President Trump has suggested he has made a decision regarding military force, it remains unclear if he will proceed with an attack. The U.S. has previously conducted strikes on boats in the region, citing drug trafficking from Venezuela, and has offered a reward for the arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. Some officials suggest the carrier's arrival may be a pressure tactic. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced 'Operation Southern Spear,' aimed at defending the homeland and removing 'narco-terrorists.' This increased activity follows the unexpected resignation of Adm. Alvin Holsey, who reportedly objected to the boat strikes that have resulted in 80 fatalities and targeted vessels that did not appear hostile.
