## Article summary
The Salt Lake County District Attorney, Sim Gill, has decided not to file charges against Tim Ballard, the founder of the anti-child-trafficking organization Operation Underground Railroad. This decision comes after several women filed lawsuits accusing Ballard of sexual assault and exploiting his position. Gill stated that there was insufficient admissible evidence to bring charges, emphasizing that the law requires evidence strong enough to remove all reasonable doubt for a jury. While he acknowledged the survivors' accounts, he stressed that the legal standard was not met. One of the lawsuits has been dismissed, though an appeal is pending, while another remains active. Ballard's attorney, Mark Eisenhut, expressed that Ballard is innocent and hopes authorities will consider charges against the accusers. Ballard resigned from Operation Underground Railroad following the allegations.
