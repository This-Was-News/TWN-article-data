## Article summary
Naturalized U.S. citizens are expressing growing apprehension regarding President Donald Trump's immigration policies, which they fear are undermining the security and promise of their citizenship. Many naturalized citizens, who believed their oath of allegiance secured them a place and protection in the United States, now feel their status is precarious. Concerns include the possibility of being questioned or detained when traveling abroad, and even within the U.S., with instances of citizens being wrongly detained. The Justice Department's memo to increase denaturalization efforts and Trump's past threats against citizenship have amplified these fears. Historically, the definition and accessibility of U.S. citizenship have fluctuated, with laws in the past restricting naturalization based on race and origin. For individuals like Dauda Sesay, who escaped civil war and found refuge in the U.S., the current climate feels like a betrayal of the commitment made when he took the oath of citizenship. This uncertainty has led some naturalized citizens to fear speaking out publicly, worried about attracting negative attention. The article highlights how the concept of who belongs in the U.S. has been a dynamic and often contested aspect of American history. The current political climate has created an atmosphere where the bedrock protection of naturalization feels increasingly unstable for many.
