## Article summary
Gaza's makeshift shelters are struggling as the first strong winter rains have begun, causing flooding and damage to infrastructure. Residents in the Muwasi tent camp are attempting to dig trenches to divert water, but rain is still leaking through tears in tarpaulins and shelters, soaking belongings. The war, now in its second year, has displaced over 2 million people, with many residing in temporary tents. The Israeli military designated Muwasi as a humanitarian zone, but aid organizations warn that winterization materials are insufficient. The United Nations reports that Muwasi was sheltering up to 425,000 displaced Palestinians. Meanwhile, a U.N. Security Council vote is expected on a U.S. proposal for a stabilization force in Gaza, facing opposition from Russia, China, and some Arab countries. The war began on October 7, 2023, with Hamas-led militants attacking Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages. Israel demands the return of remains of three hostages before progressing to the second stage of the ceasefire. Hamas claims the territory's devastation complicates finding remains, while Israel accuses the group of delays. The Gaza Health Ministry reports that Israel has returned 330 Palestinian remains, with only 97 identified. Israels military campaign has resulted in the deaths of 69,100 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
