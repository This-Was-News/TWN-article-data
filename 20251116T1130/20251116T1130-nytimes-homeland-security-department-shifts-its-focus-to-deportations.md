## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has significantly shifted its focus from its original mission of protecting Americans to a concentrated effort on arresting undocumented immigrants under President Trump's administration. This redirection has led to thousands of federal agents being diverted from their regular duties, impacting various law enforcement operations. For instance, agents investigating child exploitation cases have been reassigned, hindering efforts to pursue child predators. Similarly, national security probes, such as one into the black market for Iranian oil funding terrorism, have been slowed down. Federal efforts to combat human trafficking have also languished as investigators are pulled into deportation efforts. The Coast Guard has diverted aircraft for transporting immigrants, and the department's law enforcement academy has delayed training for many agencies to prioritize immigration officers. This overhaul represents a substantial departure for an agency created after 9/11 to prevent terrorism and protect national security. Administration officials defend the immigration crackdown, arguing it is paramount to public safety and national security, and that many crimes are linked to illegal immigration. However, federal data indicates that a significant portion of those arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement do not have criminal records in the U.S. The pressure to deport more people has intensified, with regular high-level meetings to plan and execute this operation. This has led to agents from Homeland Security Investigations, typically focused on transnational criminal organizations, being reassigned to tasks like compiling immigrant addresses and making arrests at traffic stops. Even specialists in counterterrorism and money laundering cases have been drawn into immigration work. The intensified focus on immigration has also affected intelligence sharing and law enforcement training, with programs for non-immigration agents being suspended. The Coast Guard's search-and-rescue missions have also been impacted, with planes and staff redeployed to support immigration enforcement. The shift has also negatively impacted investigations into complex human smuggling and sex trafficking cases, with federal prosecutors reporting that such cases are stagnating.
