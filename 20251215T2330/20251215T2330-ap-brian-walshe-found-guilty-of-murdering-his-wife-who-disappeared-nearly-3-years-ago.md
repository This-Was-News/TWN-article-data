## Article summary
Brian Walshe has been found guilty of the first-degree murder of his wife, Ana Walshe, who disappeared nearly three years ago. The couple lived in Cohasset, Massachusetts, and have three young children who are now in state custody. Prosecutors presented extensive digital evidence, including Walshe's online searches for terms related to dismemberment, disposing of a body, and cleaning DNA. Surveillance footage showed Walshe discarding trash bags, and a search of a processing facility uncovered items including a hatchet, towels, a Tyvek suit, and Ana Walshe's personal belongings. DNA evidence from these items and the Tyvek suit matched both Ana and Brian Walshe. An insurance executive testified that Brian Walshe was the sole beneficiary of Ana Walshe's $1 million life insurance policy. The defense argued that Ana Walshe's death was sudden and unexplained, but ultimately rested their case without calling witnesses. Walshe initially claimed his wife had a work emergency in Washington D.C., but this was not supported by evidence. He later admitted to dismembering and disposing of her body after finding her deceased in bed. Walshe faces life in prison without parole and is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday.
