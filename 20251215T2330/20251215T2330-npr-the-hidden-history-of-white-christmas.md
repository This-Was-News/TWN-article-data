## Article summary
The song 'White Christmas,' sung by Bing Crosby and written by Irving Berlin, is one of the most popular holiday songs of all time, yet it has a complex and controversial history. Despite its enduring appeal, the song's origins are rooted in personal tragedy for Berlin, who lost his young son on Christmas Day. The song itself is melancholic, reflecting a nostalgic longing for a past Christmas, a departure from typical joyful holiday tunes. Berlin, an immigrant himself, drew inspiration from 'home songs' that expressed longing for a lost homeland, adapting this theme to a Christmas context. Notably, an original, largely forgotten introductory verse depicted a New Yorker longing for the wintry north while stuck in sunny California. Scholar Jody Rosen suggests that the song's nostalgia also subtly references explicitly racist minstrel songs, such as Stephen Foster's 'Old Kentucky Home,' which had its meaning twisted over time. The song was central to the 1942 film 'Holiday Inn,' which itself contained racist stereotypes and a blackface number, a practice that was a recent memory for audiences at the time. The pairing of nostalgia for Christmas with nostalgia for blackface in the film is noted by scholar Brynn Shiovitz. Despite its problematic history, 'White Christmas' became immensely popular, especially with American GIs during WWII, leading to another film centered on the song in 1954. Over the decades, countless artists have recorded versions of the song, and each generation adds new layers of meaning, often separating the song from its complex past.
