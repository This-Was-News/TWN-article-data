## Article summary
President Trump faced immediate backlash for attacking Hollywood director Rob Reiner less than a day after reports of his stabbing death, baselessly suggesting Reiner's criticism of Trump may have led to his murder. Trump wrote on Truth Social that Reiner's death was due to "TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME," a claim he doubled down on when questioned by reporters. The police stated Reiner's 32-year-old son was arrested on suspicion of murder, with no indication that political beliefs were a factor. This attack prompted criticism even from some MAGA-aligned Republicans and allies, who urged Trump to retract his comments and called the post inappropriate and disrespectful. Jenna Ellis, a former Trump lawyer, stated, "This is NOT the appropriate response." Other Republicans, including Representatives Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene, condemned the post, emphasizing that it was a family tragedy and not a political matter. Senator Chuck Schumer also criticized Trump, stating he "knows no shame." This incident highlights a pattern of Trump showing little empathy for the deaths of perceived rivals. Reiner's son had reportedly struggled with drug abuse and homelessness.
