The son of acclaimed director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the discovery of their bodies at their Los Angeles home. The couple, who were married for over 35 years, were found stabbed to death. Their son, Nick Reiner, who has spoken publicly about his struggles with drug abuse and homelessness, was taken into custody. The arrest occurred after witnesses reported seeing Rob and Nick Reiner in an argument at a party the night before the deaths. Rob Reiner was a celebrated filmmaker known for classics like 'This Is Spinal Tap,' 'When Harry Met Sally…,' and 'The Princess Bride,' and was also a prominent political activist. Michele Singer Reiner was a photographer and producer who influenced her husband's work, notably by inspiring the changed ending of 'When Harry Met Sally….' The couple were active in Democratic politics and championed various liberal causes. President Trump drew criticism for his comments suggesting Reiner's political criticism may have led to his death. The Reiners' son, Nick, had previously collaborated with his father on the film 'Being Charlie,' which was loosely based on Nick's own experiences with addiction.
