## Article summary
Director and actor Rob Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, 68, were found dead in their Los Angeles home, with authorities believing they were victims of a stabbing. Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder, with bail set at $4 million. The incident has sent shockwaves through Hollywood and beyond, with tributes pouring in from celebrities, politicians, and sports figures. Former President Joe Biden offered condolences, highlighting the Reiners' "extraordinary contributions." President Donald Trump, however, controversially posted on social media, blaming Reiner's death on his opposition to Trump's policies, a statement that drew criticism from some Republicans. Nick Reiner had previously spoken publicly about his struggles with addiction, and he and his father had collaborated on a semi-autobiographical film, "Being Charlie," exploring their relationship. The Reiner family, known for their contributions to comedy and film, was seen as a symbol of a gentle and hopeful spirit in American culture. The investigation into the deaths is ongoing, with the case to be presented to the district attorney's office for formal charges.
