## Article summary
Two Brown University students, 18-year-old MukhammadAziz Umurzokov and 19-year-old Ella Cook, have been identified as the victims of a shooting on campus. Umurzokov, who aspired to be a neurosurgeon, is remembered for his kindness and intelligence, leaving a void in the Uzbek American community. Cook, a sophomore and vice president of the Brown College Republicans, is described as a devoted Christian and conservative with a bold, brave, and kind heart. The gunman remains at large after the attack, which also injured nine other students, with seven in critical but stable condition, one in critical condition, and one discharged. Police released a person of interest, a 24-year-old man, leaving authorities without a known suspect. The shooting occurred in an academic building during final exams, prompting the cancellation of most remaining in-person exams to allow the university community to focus on support and healing. The Ivy League school's community was shocked by the violence just days before winter break. Authorities had previously described the suspect as a male dressed in black who fled the scene on foot.
