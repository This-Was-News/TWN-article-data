## Article summary
Australia is moving swiftly to enact stricter gun laws following a tragic mass shooting at Bondi Beach that killed at least 15 people. The country already has some of the strictest gun laws globally, established after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, which led to the National Firearms Agreement. This agreement restricted certain types of firearms and implemented a national buyback program. Despite the success of these laws in preventing mass shootings for over two decades, firearm ownership has been increasing, and some provisions have been weakened. In response to the recent attack, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and regional leaders have agreed to renegotiate the National Firearms Agreement, speed up the creation of a National Firearms Register, limit the number and types of guns an individual can own, and restrict licenses to citizens only. The National Cabinet, a body comprising the Prime Minister and state/territory leaders, facilitates swift policy coordination. Public support for stronger gun laws remains high in Australia, with a recent poll indicating a strong majority in favor of tightening regulations. This swift action is also enabled by a political culture that generally gravitates towards the center and prioritizes community safety.
