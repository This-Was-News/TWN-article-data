## Article summary
Senator Ted Cruz is pushing for new restrictions on military flights to be approved before government funding expires at the end of January. These measures are intended to prevent future midair collisions, such as the one that tragically killed 67 people in January. Cruz and Senator Maria Cantwell are advocating for the removal of provisions from a defense bill that would allow military aircraft to operate without broadcasting their precise location, a practice in place before the fatal crash. They argue that this exemption was the direct cause of the January 29th collision. Before the crash, military helicopters frequently flew in the airspace around Washington D.C. without using the ADS-B system, which the FAA later mandated for all aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board, senators, airlines, and transportation unions have all expressed strong criticism of these new provisions in the defense bill. Cruz has stated he will hold up government funding until the ROTOR Act, which requires all aircraft to broadcast their locations, is passed. Families of the crash victims support the ROTOR Act and fear that the defense bill's provisions will reverse safety improvements and jeopardize aviation safety around Reagan National Airport.
