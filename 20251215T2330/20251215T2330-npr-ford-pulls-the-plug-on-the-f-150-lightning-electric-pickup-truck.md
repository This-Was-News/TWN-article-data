## Article summary
Ford has ceased production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, shifting its focus to hybrid vehicles and a future lineup of smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. The company cited customer demand and the F-150 Lightning's lack of profitability as key reasons for the decision. While customers desire electrification benefits like instant torque and mobile power, affordability remains a critical factor. The F-150 Lightning, initially launched with a low price point, saw its cost increase significantly by the 2025 model. Despite critical acclaim and being the best-selling electric truck last quarter, the segment as a whole has struggled with performance and affordability expectations. Ford lost money on every F-150 Lightning sold, and production costs did not decrease as anticipated. Changes in the regulatory environment, including the rollback of EV incentives and fuel economy standards, also influenced Ford's decision. The company plans to introduce more compact and affordable EVs, targeting a price point of $30,000. Ford will repurpose its excess battery production capacity to create batteries for stationary storage, which can be used to balance the electric grid, power data centers, and serve other industrial customers.
