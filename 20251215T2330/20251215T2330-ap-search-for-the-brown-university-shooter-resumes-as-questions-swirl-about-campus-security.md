## Article summary
Authorities have resumed their search for a gunman who killed two Brown University students and wounded nine others in a shooting that occurred during final exams. While a person of interest was initially detained, they were later released as evidence pointed elsewhere, leaving law enforcement without a clear suspect. New video footage released by authorities shows a masked individual in a dark jacket walking away from the scene, providing the clearest images of the suspect to date. The investigation is focusing on tracing the suspect's movements after the attack and searching for physical evidence, with law enforcement asking for public assistance. Questions are being raised about campus security, the apparent lack of surveillance cameras in the shooting location, and the time the suspect may have gained to escape due to the initial focus on the released person of interest. The two students killed have been identified as Ella Cook, a sophomore involved in campus Republican activities and active in her church, and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, a freshman who had overcome significant health challenges. Of the nine injured, one has been released, while the rest remain in critical condition. The attack has prompted increased security measures at other universities, including Yale, during Hanukkah celebrations.
