## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm in Jamaica's recorded history, is bearing down on the island as a catastrophic Category 5 storm. Forecasters anticipate landfall early Tuesday, with the storm expected to traverse the island diagonally before hitting Cuba. The Jamaican government has stated its infrastructure is not equipped to withstand such a powerful storm, emphasizing recovery as the primary challenge. Ahead of Melissa's arrival, the island experienced landslides, fallen trees, and widespread power outages, with officials warning of a slow cleanup process. A life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet is projected for southern Jamaica, prompting concerns for coastal hospitals. The storm has already been blamed for seven deaths across the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic. Melissa's sustained winds are reported at 175 mph, moving north-northeast. Despite government evacuation orders, many families are sheltering in place, expressing profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods. Cuba is evacuating over 600,000 people from its eastern region in preparation for the hurricane's expected landfall. Melissa is also forecast to impact the southeast Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands.
