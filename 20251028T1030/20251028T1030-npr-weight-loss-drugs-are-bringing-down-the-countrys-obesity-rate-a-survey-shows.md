## Article summary
A recent Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index survey indicates a slight decrease in the United States' obesity rate, attributed to the increasing use of injectable weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. The obesity rate has fallen to 37% of U.S. adults from a high of 39.9% three years ago. The number of Americans taking GLP-1 agonist medications, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, more than doubled in the past year and a half, reaching 12.4% of respondents. These drugs, approved starting in 2021, work by suppressing hunger and slowing digestion, offering a potential solution to the long-standing issue of obesity. The survey observed a more significant decline in obesity rates among individuals aged 40 to 64, a demographic that shows higher reliance on these medications, with obesity rates dropping by 5.0 points to 42.8% in the 50-64 age group. Women also appear to be taking these drugs more frequently and experiencing greater weight loss compared to men. Despite these positive trends, access to these medications remains a significant concern. Many private insurers are reportedly discontinuing coverage for GLP-1 medications, potentially increasing out-of-pocket costs to around $500 per month. While efforts are underway to develop more affordable pill versions, these treatments may still be out of reach for many individuals.
