## Article summary
The Trump administration has stated that emergency funds cannot be used to maintain Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during a government shutdown, blaming Democrats for the lapse in funding. Millions of Americans are expected to lose their food assistance in early November as states scramble to cover the difference. SNAP, an entitlement program providing food aid to about one in eight U.S. residents, is funded through annual Congressional appropriations, which lapsed on October 1. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) claims its contingency funds are only for supplementing existing appropriations, not for covering benefits when appropriations have ceased. This stance contradicts a previous USDA shutdown lapse plan which indicated that multi-year contingency funds were available to ensure SNAP operations, including participant benefits, could continue during a shutdown. Budget experts disagree with the administration's interpretation, arguing that SNAP contingency funds should be used in this situation and that the administration is using SNAP funding as a political tool. The administration previously transferred $300 million to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) from a separate fund, and has used other funds to maintain military pay. Despite legal provisions for contingency funds to "carry out program operations," the administration's current position suggests these funds are unavailable for regular SNAP benefits during the shutdown, leading to widespread concern about the program's continuity and the impact on recipients.
