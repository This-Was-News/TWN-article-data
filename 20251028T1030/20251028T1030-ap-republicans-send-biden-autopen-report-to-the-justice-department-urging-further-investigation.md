## Article summary
House Republicans have released a report on President Joe Biden's use of the autopen, urging the Justice Department to investigate further. The report criticizes Biden's time in office and his inner circle, largely rehashing public information and making broad accusations. While it doesn't present concrete evidence of aides conspiring or the president being unaware of official actions, Republicans claim their findings cast doubt on all of Biden's actions. The report heavily focuses on contested claims that Biden's mental state declined, allowing White House officials to enact policies without his knowledge, particularly concerning pardons. Republicans allege a cover-up of the president's cognitive decline orchestrated by his inner circle, targeting his doctor and senior aides who invoked their Fifth Amendment rights. They have also sent a letter to the D.C. Board of Medicine urging disciplinary action against Biden's doctor. The report argues that executive actions taken via the autopen should be considered void without documented proof of Biden's approval. Democrats have denounced the probe as a distraction and a waste of time, while legal experts warn of potential future legal issues for administrations that use similar methods.
