## Article summary
China has signed an expanded free trade agreement with ASEAN, with Premier Li Qiang promoting closer economic ties as an alternative to U.S. protectionism. Li emphasized solidarity and cooperation to overcome global economic uncertainties, criticizing confrontation and economic bullying. However, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed skepticism, stating that cooperation cannot coexist with coercion, particularly in light of ongoing disputes in the South China Sea. The ASEAN-China Free Trade Area 3.0, the third revision of the agreement, aims to lower tariffs, boost services and investment, and covers a market of over 2 billion people, with two-way trade reaching nearly $1 trillion last year. The upgraded pact is expected to enhance integration in areas like digital trade and sustainability. Despite welcoming the trade deal, Marcos highlighted continued harassment in the South China Sea and urged China to commit to meaningful engagement. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim stressed ASEAN's desire for friendly relations with all countries, reflecting the bloc's centrality. The summit concluded with an agreement to accelerate negotiations for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, with leaders agreeing that the region should not be an area of superpower contestation.
