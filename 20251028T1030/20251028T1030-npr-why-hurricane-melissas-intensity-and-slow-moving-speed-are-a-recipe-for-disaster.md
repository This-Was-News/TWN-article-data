## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm with sustained winds of 157 mph or greater, is rapidly intensifying and barreling toward Jamaica, threatening to be the strongest storm to hit the island in modern history. The National Hurricane Center forecasts landfall early Tuesday morning, with the potential for catastrophic damage, severe flooding, and landslides due to its intensity and slow-moving pace. Jamaica's prime minister, Andrew Holness, stated that the country's infrastructure cannot withstand a Category 5 storm and that precautionary measures, including resident relocation, are being taken. Melissa is expected to impact Jamaica's eyewall, experiencing the fiercest winds and heaviest rainfall, potentially up to 30 inches. The slow pace means prolonged exposure to these destructive forces, similar to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which caused extensive flooding and fatalities. The mountainous terrain of Jamaica further exacerbates the risk of flash flooding and landslides as heavy rainfall flows downhill. Beyond Jamaica, Melissa is forecast to affect parts of Cuba and the Bahamas later in the week, with eastern Cuba potentially receiving up to 20 inches of rain and the southeast Bahamas up to 10 inches. Southwestern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic are also at risk. Climate change is contributing to the increased frequency of larger, more powerful storms, and research indicates that slow-moving tropical storms have become more common in recent decades.
