## Article summary
Food banks and pantries are preparing for a significant increase in demand due to a looming pause in federal food aid caused by the government shutdown. This comes after already struggling with federal program cuts earlier in the year. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which assists 40 million Americans, is set to halt benefits in November as the administration will not use contingency funds to maintain aid. States that temporarily cover food assistance costs will not be reimbursed. Charitable food services, which supplement federal programs, have seen rising demand since the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation spike. Earlier this year, programs providing over $1 billion for schools and food banks were ended. Individuals relying on SNAP express deep concern about how they will feed their families and themselves. While some food banks have strong donor support, others are facing critically low food supplies due to previous funding issues. Some states are fast-tracking emergency funds to help food pantries, but others are directing recipients to charitable groups and personal networks for assistance. Experts warn that the implications of removing SNAP are catastrophic, and the situation is already dire and worsening.
