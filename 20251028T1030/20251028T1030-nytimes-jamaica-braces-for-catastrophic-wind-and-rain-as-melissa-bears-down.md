## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm with 175 m.p.h. winds, is projected to make a direct hit on Jamaica. The storm is expected to cause catastrophic damage with torrential rainfall, potentially leading to widespread power and communication outages. Jamaican officials are concerned that not enough residents are heeding evacuation orders, with only about 1,700 having evacuated to shelters by Monday evening, despite anticipating the displacement of 50,000 people. Jamaica, heavily reliant on tourism, has limited resources for disaster preparedness. At least three deaths and thirteen injuries have been linked to storm preparations. Melissa's landfall is anticipated on Tuesday in St. Elizabeth Parish, with extreme weather expected to impact the island overnight. The storm is predicted to maintain hurricane strength as it passes through the Bahamas, bypassing the United States. Regional preparations include evacuations in Cuba and the relocation of U.S. Navy personnel and warships from Guantánamo Bay. The National Weather Service continues its operations despite reduced staffing due to a government shutdown. The World Food Program has positioned a limited amount of food in Haiti due to donor priorities shifting to other global crises.
