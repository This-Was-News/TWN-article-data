## Article summary
Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has maintained her support for a discharge petition aimed at compelling the release of Jeffrey Epstein's investigative files. Despite a recent meeting with Trump administration officials at the White House, Boebert stated she felt no pressure to withdraw her support. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt characterized the meeting as an effort to demonstrate transparency. Boebert, alongside three other Republicans, signed the bipartisan petition initiated by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna. The petition reached the required 218 signatures with the addition of Democratic Representative Adelita Grijalva. Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the House will vote on the bill next week. However, passage in the Senate and subsequent signing into law by President Trump, who has previously called the effort the "Epstein Hoax," are not guaranteed.
