## Article summary
The longest government shutdown in U.S. history has ended after 43 days, with President Trump signing a bill to reopen the government. However, a return to normal operations will not be immediate. Federal workers, who have gone without pay for six weeks, are returning to work and are guaranteed back pay, though the exact timing may vary by agency. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been funded through September 2026, alleviating concerns about food assistance for millions. Smithsonian institutions, including museums and the National Zoo, will reopen on a rolling basis starting Friday. Air travel disruptions are expected to linger due to shortages of air traffic controllers who worked without pay, and airlines will need time to adjust schedules. National Parks face a long recovery period to address damage and lost revenue due to reduced staffing and services. The IRS, which furloughed many workers and paused tax refunds, is preparing for tax filing season, but experts worry about potential backlogs and a messy 2026 tax season. The shutdown may have permanently impaired economic data, with some reports likely never to be released. This bill only funds the government through January 30, raising the possibility of another shutdown in the near future.
