## Article summary
Some supporters of President Trump are expressing concern that he is drifting away from his "America First" populist agenda. These worries stem from his recent actions, including dining with billionaires, revamping the White House opulently while Americans struggle, and showing interest in foreign crises and skilled foreign workers. A significant point of contention is Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, where his resistance to further disclosures has angered a segment of his base that previously pushed for accountability. Critics, like Representative Thomas Massie, argue that the administration is prioritizing foreign entanglements and fiscal irresponsibility over domestic needs. Trump allies acknowledge the muddled populist message, noting his courting of wealthy donors and pursuit of international accolades. Despite these concerns and a dip in approval ratings, Trump maintains that he understands his base's desires and that his actions, including foreign policy successes, ultimately benefit America. However, some former aides and supporters feel his rhetoric during the campaign was a "means to an end," and that his current policies favor the wealthy over the working class.
