## Article summary
Top officials at Fannie Mae were ousted after raising concerns about the sharing of confidential mortgage pricing data. Lauren Smith, a confidant of Bill Pulte, the Trump administration's top housing regulator, provided this sensitive information to Freddie Mac, a competitor, at Pulte's request. This action alarmed Fannie Mae executives, who feared it could lead to accusations of collusion to fix mortgage rates. Senior officials, including Malloy Evans and Fannie Mae's CEO Priscilla Almodovar, who questioned Smith's actions, were subsequently forced out. Internal ethics investigators looking into Pulte and his associates were also dismissed. These dismissals have caused a stir in the housing industry and drawn criticism from Democrats, who accuse Pulte of weaponizing his position for political gain. Critics suggest Pulte is using his role to advance Donald Trump's agenda, citing his past actions, such as pushing for cryptocurrency acceptance in mortgage criteria and proposing a 50-year mortgage. Pulte has also publicly focused on large homebuilders, demanding increased construction volume and hinting at a crackdown. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which Pulte leads, stated that its regulated entities must comply with all laws. Fannie Mae also affirmed its commitment to compliance. Pulte and Smith did not respond to requests for comment. The situation highlights potential conflicts of interest arising from Pulte's multiple roles and his efforts to align with President Trump.
