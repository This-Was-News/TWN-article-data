## Article summary
Russia launched a significant missile and drone attack on Kyiv early Friday, resulting in four fatalities and at least 34 injuries, including a pregnant woman. The assault, which also impacted Odesa and Kharkiv, was primarily directed at the capital, with drones and missiles striking residential buildings. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the attack as calculated to maximize civilian harm, a claim Russia denies, stating it targeted military-industrial and energy facilities. This offensive was the most substantial on Kyiv in nearly three weeks, following a pattern of Russian strikes on energy infrastructure ahead of winter. Ukraine utilized American-made Patriot air defense systems to repel the attack, shooting down 14 missiles, though Zelenskyy appealed for more such systems. In Odesa, Russian drones hit a street in Chornomorsk, killing two and injuring seven. Survivors recounted harrowing escapes from damaged apartment blocks. The wider Kyiv region also sustained damage to critical infrastructure and homes. In retaliation, Ukraine has deployed its own drones and missiles against Russian targets, including oil refineries and manufacturing plants. Russia reported intercepting numerous Ukrainian drones over its regions and Crimea, while Ukraine claimed to have used Neptune missiles to strike deep into Russia. Attacks in Russia's Krasnodar and Saratov regions reportedly damaged an oil depot, coastal structures, and civilian infrastructure.
