## Article summary
A growing number of Americans are turning to unapproved peptide injections, promoted by influencers and allies of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for purported benefits like muscle building, skin rejuvenation, and longevity. These substances are distinct from FDA-approved GLP-1 medications and often lack rigorous human clinical trials, with evidence frequently derived from animal studies. Some peptides, like BPC-157 and TB-500, are banned by sports authorities as doping agents. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has attempted to regulate these products, issuing warning letters and identifying peptides unsuitable for compounding. However, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to end the FDA's oversight of such alternative treatments, aligning with proponents like Gary Brecka who sell peptide products. While the FDA has flagged certain peptides for safety risks, industry groups have pushed back, leading to legal challenges and reviews. Experts caution patients to question the long-term safety and efficacy of these unregulated injections, as the actual contents and purity of research-grade peptides can be uncertain, with many sourced internationally.
