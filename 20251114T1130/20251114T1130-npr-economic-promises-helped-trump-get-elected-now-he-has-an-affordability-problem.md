## Article summary
President Trump is facing an "affordability problem" as voters express concern over the economy and cost of living, despite his claims of economic success. Trump's campaign pledge to "make America affordable again" is resurfacing as polls indicate public dissatisfaction, with many blaming his policies for rising prices. While Trump frequently highlights stock market highs and claims costs are down, a senior administration official acknowledges there's "no finish line" in addressing economic strain. Trump's approach has been characterized by boasting about economic indicators and dismissing anxieties, even calling rising costs a "con job by the Democrats" and questioning the validity of polls. This stance contrasts with the cautious messaging of previous administrations and has drawn criticism from within his own party, with some Republicans stating that simply holding inflation steady doesn't alleviate the burden of high prices. Experts note that consumer confidence is low, and people are negatively impacted by inflation, regardless of wage growth. Key cost issues identified include grocery prices, home prices, and healthcare costs, with a general sentiment that despite potential increases in purchasing power, people are not "feeling the love" due to the focus on rising expenses.
