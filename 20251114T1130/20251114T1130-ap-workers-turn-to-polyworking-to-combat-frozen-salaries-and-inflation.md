## Article summary
Professionals in the U.S. are increasingly taking on side jobs or multiple jobs, a practice known as 'polyworking,' to create a financial safety net against inflation, stagnant wages, and the fear of layoffs. This trend offers a way to supplement income and maintain financial stability in an uncertain job market. For example, Katelyn Cusick holds a full-time job as a visual merchandiser, manages social media for a shoe brand, sells paintings on Etsy, and ushers at concerts. She finds this variety stimulating and appreciates the extra income to manage living costs, as her main job's salary has not increased in years. Others are driven by workplace instability or a reluctance to depend on a single employer, turning to gig work platforms like Uber and Grubhub. Sociologist Alexandrea Ravenelle notes that stagnant salaries and rising living costs are pushing people to seek additional income streams. Some are building 'portfolio careers,' acquiring diverse skills through various roles, similar to Cusick's efforts to keep her social media marketing skills current. Career experts advise following a passion for side ventures, as they require significant personal time and effort. Josie White, for instance, turned her passion for mental health advocacy into a side pursuit of public speaking, sharing her experiences to help others. While launching a side hustle may involve initial investment and time before generating income, it can eventually lead to paid opportunities. Gig work, like food delivery or ride-sharing, can provide immediate income, as demonstrated by Tom Ritter, who used it to supplement his earnings and cover bills after losing his full-time job. However, experts caution against over-reliance on gig work due to its potential stigma and the platforms' tendency to reduce earnings through algorithm changes. They also advise skepticism towards online opportunities that seem too good to be true, as some may be scams. Finding time for multiple jobs can impact personal life, but for some, like White, the fulfillment derived from their ventures outweighs the perceived imbalance.
