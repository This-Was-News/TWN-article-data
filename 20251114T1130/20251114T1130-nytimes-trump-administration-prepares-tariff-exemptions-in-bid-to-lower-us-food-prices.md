## Article summary
The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to grant broad exemptions to certain tariffs in an effort to reduce high food prices impacting American consumers. This potential rollback of a key economic policy comes amid growing concerns about affordability, which played a significant role in recent election outcomes. The proposed exemptions are expected to cover reciprocal tariffs imposed on products from countries that have not yet reached trade agreements with the administration. Specifically, beef and citrus products are being considered for exemptions, though a final decision from President Trump is pending. This plan is more extensive than a previous proposal that would have been limited to products not primarily produced domestically and sourced from countries with existing trade deals. The earlier executive order had directed the commerce secretary and the U.S. trade representative to identify exemptions for over a thousand product categories, including metals, minerals, antibiotics, plane parts, and various foreign agricultural goods like coffee, pineapples, avocados, and vanilla beans. The current move signifies a shift in economic strategy driven by consumer anxieties over the cost of living, even as President Trump has maintained that prices are decreasing.
