## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation's health secretary, is navigating a complex situation regarding new deals for obesity drugs. He recently stood with President Trump in the Oval Office, praising a new drug pricing agreement for weight loss medications and thanking the CEOs of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. This stance contrasts sharply with Kennedy's past criticisms of these same drugs and pharmaceutical companies. A year ago, he accused Novo Nordisk of exploiting Americans' perceived addiction to drugs. The new deals aim to lower prices and expand coverage for obesity drugs under Medicare and Medicaid. This initiative appears to conflict with Kennedy's previous skepticism, a view echoed by some of his supporters. However, neither Kennedy nor prominent followers of the Make America Healthy Again movement seem willing to publicly oppose Trump. As the health secretary, Kennedy is attempting to balance the president's agenda with his supporters' concerns. He has been observed oscillating between promoting weight loss drugs as "miracle drugs" and raising questions about their safety. Representatives for Kennedy declined to make him available for an interview regarding this matter. He has recently framed the pharmaceutical industry's profitable weight loss drugs as a component of his healthy food campaign aimed at combating chronic diseases.
