## Article summary
Mecklenburg Sheriff Garry McFadden announced that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents are expected in Charlotte for an immigration operation as soon as Saturday, potentially extending into early next week. McFadden stated that his office has not been asked to assist in these enforcement actions but welcomes the open communication with federal partners to ensure community safety. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department clarified that they do not participate in immigration enforcement, as it is the responsibility of ICE. This announcement follows national media reports about federal agents being deployed to cities like Charlotte for immigration enforcement. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools assured parents that there has been no immigration enforcement activity on campuses and no official notice of planned actions, emphasizing their commitment to protecting students' rights. Mayor Vi Lyles urged residents to avoid spreading unverified information to prevent unnecessary fear and uncertainty, acknowledging that details about the operation's scope remain unclear.
