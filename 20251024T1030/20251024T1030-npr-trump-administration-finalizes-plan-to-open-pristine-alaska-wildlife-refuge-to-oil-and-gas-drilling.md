## Article summary
The Trump administration has finalized plans to open the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. This decision fulfills a pledge made by President Trump and congressional Republicans to allow development in the refuge's 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, considered sacred by the Indigenous Gwich'in people. The plan includes at least four lease sales over a 10-year period. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the decision, which also involves restoring previously canceled oil and gas leases. While leaders in Indigenous Gwich'in communities oppose drilling due to its impact on a vital caribou herd, leaders in Kaktovik, an Iñupiaq community within the refuge, support drilling for economic reasons. Environmental groups like The Wilderness Society and the Center for Biological Diversity have criticized the decision, arguing it prioritizes corporate interests over the environment and Indigenous communities. Separately, the administration finalized a land exchange deal to build a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, connecting King Cove and Cold Bay. This road is seen by King Cove residents as crucial for accessing emergency medical care. However, conservationists and some tribal leaders plan legal challenges, concerned about the road's impact on migratory birds and ecologically sensitive lands. Senator Lisa Murkowski described the refuge as a "bread basket" for waterfowl and emphasized the need for minimal disturbance during road construction.
