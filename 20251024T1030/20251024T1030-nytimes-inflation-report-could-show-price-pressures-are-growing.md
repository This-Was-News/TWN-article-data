## Article summary
The upcoming Consumer Price Index report for September is expected to show a rise in U.S. inflation, potentially reflecting the impact of President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. This data is crucial for the Federal Reserve as it prepares to lower interest rates to support the labor market, but the ongoing government shutdown complicates the Fed's decision-making process by delaying the release of key economic indicators. The September inflation report, delayed by 10 days due to the shutdown, is forecast to indicate an overall inflation increase of 3.1 percent year-over-year, with core inflation also steady at 3.1 percent. Tariffs are expected to contribute to higher prices for some goods, though companies' existing inventories have buffered immediate price hikes in other sectors. Services inflation remains a concern, potentially keeping inflation above the Fed's 2 percent target. The Fed faces a dilemma: lowering rates too quickly could fuel inflation, while moving too slowly might harm the economy. Officials are widely anticipated to cut borrowing costs by a quarter of a percentage point at their upcoming meeting, but there is internal debate on the pace of future rate reductions amid mixed economic signals and the lack of comprehensive data due to the shutdown.
