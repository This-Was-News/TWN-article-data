## Article summary
The U.S. military has conducted strikes on alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean, expanding a campaign that began in the Caribbean Sea. These strikes, the eighth and ninth of their kind, have resulted in at least 37 deaths. The Trump administration claims these individuals were cartel members transporting drugs, but has not publicly provided evidence, raising concerns about the legality and true objectives of these actions. International law experts question the justification, suggesting the military buildup in the Caribbean might be aimed at toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro rather than solely countering drug trafficking. President Trump asserts his commander-in-chief authority and claims these actions are necessary for national security and saving American lives, even suggesting potential future strikes on land. However, Congress holds the power to declare war, and lawmakers, including some Republicans and Democrats, have voiced concerns about potential violations of domestic and international laws. Critics argue that the administration is setting a precedent of "shoot first, ask questions later," potentially leading to extrajudicial executions without proper legal basis. Colombia's president has accused the U.S. of murder, leading to a halt in U.S. aid to Colombia. Independent United Nations experts have also stated that such lethal force without a legal basis violates international law.
