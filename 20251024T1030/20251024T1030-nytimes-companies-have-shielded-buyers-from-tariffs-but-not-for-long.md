## Article summary
Companies have largely absorbed the costs of recent tariffs, passing on only about 37 percent to consumers, 9 percent to suppliers, and absorbing 51 percent themselves. This strategy has helped keep inflation in check so far, but it is becoming increasingly unsustainable as tariffs are higher and more widespread than in previous periods. Many companies initially absorbed costs while awaiting a more stable trade landscape, but are now exploring options like squeezing foreign suppliers, improving internal operations, or implementing price increases. Major corporations like Nike, Mattel, and Raytheon have reported significant tariff-related expenses, with some, like Autoliv, managing to recoup most of their costs. However, industries like automotive, which have been reluctant to raise prices due to hopes of tariff relief and competition, are seeing their profit margins squeezed. Conversely, some domestic manufacturers, such as steel producers, are benefiting from tariffs making imports more expensive, leading to increased demand and higher margins. Smaller businesses, with less leverage, are finding it difficult to absorb costs and are being forced to implement significant price increases, signaling that consumers will likely face broader price hikes across various sectors as companies seek to protect their profit margins.
