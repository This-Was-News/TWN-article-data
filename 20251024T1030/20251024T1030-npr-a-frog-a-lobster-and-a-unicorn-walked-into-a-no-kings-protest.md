## Article summary
Protesters at recent "No Kings" rallies across the U.S. adopted a unique tactic: dressing in inflatable animal costumes, including frogs and unicorns. This trend, inspired by an incident at an anti-ICE rally in Portland, Oregon, where a protester in a frog suit was targeted by law enforcement, aimed to counter the Republican narrative that demonstrators are "hate-filled, anti-American radicals." Scott Rohrbach, who attended a rally in Washington D.C. dressed as a unicorn, stated his desire to counteract this perception and expressed concern about future election fairness under President Trump. The use of humor and absurdity in protests is seen by experts as an effective strategy against authoritarian figures, making government responses appear more foolish. For instance, Brooks Brown and Jordy Lybeck organized "Operation Inflation" to distribute costumes in Portland, aiming to undermine claims that the city was a "war zone." This tactic makes it difficult to portray protesters as threatening, as demonstrated by a police officer's observation that individuals in such costumes are unlikely to engage in activities requiring quick escape. Princeton professor Kim Lane Scheppele notes that absurdist humor can trap officials into making the government look worse when they react. The "No Kings" rallies, despite being dismissed by President Trump, have highlighted how unconventional methods can shift public perception and challenge official narratives.
