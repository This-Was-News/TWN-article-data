## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced the termination of all trade negotiations with Canada following the broadcast of a television advertisement opposing U.S. tariffs. Trump claimed the ad, which featured Ronald Reagan, misrepresented facts and was an egregious attempt to influence U.S. court decisions. This action escalates existing trade tensions between the two neighboring countries. The ad, created by the government of Ontario, was criticized by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute for misrepresenting the former president's remarks and for using them without permission. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had previously stated his intention to increase exports to countries outside the U.S. due to the threat of American tariffs. Trump views tariffs as crucial for U.S. national security and economy. The ad campaign was launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford to protest American tariffs on Canada. Trump had previously taken retaliatory measures, such as doubling steel and aluminum tariffs, in response to actions by Canadian officials. Canada has imposed its own retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods, with some exemptions for automakers. These trade disputes have impacted Canada's auto sector, with Stellantis announcing a production line move from Ontario to Illinois.
