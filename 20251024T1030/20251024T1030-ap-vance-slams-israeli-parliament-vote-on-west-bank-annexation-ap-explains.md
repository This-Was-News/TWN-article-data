## Article summary
U.S. Vice President JD Vance strongly criticized a symbolic vote in Israel's parliament regarding the annexation of the occupied West Bank. He stated that the vote was an insult and contradicted the policies of the Trump administration. This preliminary vote was passed by hard-liners in the Israeli parliament, narrowly supporting the annexation of parts of the West Bank. The vote appeared to be an attempt to embarrass Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during Vance's visit to the country. The Associated Press provided an explanation of the events.
