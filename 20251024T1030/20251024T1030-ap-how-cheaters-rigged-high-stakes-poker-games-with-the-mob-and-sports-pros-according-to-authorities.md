## Article summary
Authorities have revealed a sophisticated cheating ring that operated high-stakes, illegal poker games, allegedly backed by the mafia and involving NBA figures. The ring employed advanced technology, including tricked-out shuffling machines that could determine the exact order of cards and transmit winning hand information wirelessly to a "quarterback" at the table. This quarterback would then use subtle signals to inform fellow cheaters how to bet. Other alleged high-tech methods included X-ray tables to identify face-down cards, hidden cameras in chip trays, and customized contact lenses to read marked cards. These games, primarily Texas Hold em, targeted wealthy individuals, luring them with high stakes and the prospect of playing with professional athletes and coaches, referred to as "face cards." Among those charged are former NBA player and coach Chauncey Billups and former NBA assistant coach Damon Jones. The victims reportedly lost millions of dollars, with money laundered through shell companies. The organizers also allegedly resorted to low-tech tactics like physical intimidation and violence to collect debts from players who couldn't pay. Damon Jones is also accused of a separate scheme involving exploiting private player information for NBA game bets.
