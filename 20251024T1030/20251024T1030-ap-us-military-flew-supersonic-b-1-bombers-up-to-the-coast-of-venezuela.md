## Article summary
The U.S. military conducted a training flight of supersonic B-1 bombers along the coast of Venezuela, following a similar exercise with B-52 bombers and F-35 stealth fighters the previous week. This increased military activity in the Caribbean has fueled speculation about President Trump's intentions regarding Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who faces U.S. narcoterrorism charges. The U.S. has been conducting strikes on suspected drug-trafficking vessels off Venezuela's coast since early September. President Trump stated that while the B-1 flight was not meant to increase pressure, the U.S. is unhappy with Venezuela for various reasons, including drug trafficking. The U.S. military presence in the Caribbean is substantial, including warships, patrol aircraft, drones, and fighter jets. Trump has indicated readiness to take further action, potentially including land-based operations, and has drawn parallels between the current crackdown on drug trafficking and the war on terrorism. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to hunt down and eliminate foreign terrorist organizations involved in drug trafficking, comparing the effort to the U.S. response after the 9/11 attacks.
