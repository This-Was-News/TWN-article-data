## Article summary
President Trump announced he is terminating trade negotiations with Canada, citing a video ad paid for by the province of Ontario that featured former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. Trump claimed the ad was fake and intended to interfere with a Supreme Court decision on his tariffs. However, the quotes used in the ad were from a 1987 Reagan radio address critiquing protectionist policies, though taken from different parts of the speech. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute stated the ad used selective audio and video, misrepresenting Reagan's address. This statement apparently prompted Trump's decision to end the talks. Trump has maintained an aggressive stance on trade with Canada, imposing significant tariffs on its exports. Canadian sentiment towards the U.S. has soured due to the Trump administration's actions. This development occurs as Canada prepares for the World Series and amid ongoing reviews of the North American free trade agreement. The Ontario government spent approximately $53.5 million to broadcast the ad, which highlights Reagan's warnings about tariffs causing market shrinkage, job losses, and trade wars. Premier Doug Ford of Ontario stated he used Reagan's words to make the case against American tariffs.
