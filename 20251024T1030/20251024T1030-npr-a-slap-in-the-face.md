## Article summary
American cattle ranchers are expressing anger and feeling betrayed by a recent U.S. plan to increase beef imports from Argentina. This move comes as beef prices have soared in the U.S. due to a reduced cattle supply, a situation exacerbated by drought and rising operational costs. President Trump suggested importing Argentine beef as a way to lower consumer prices, while also noting Argentina's economic struggles. However, ranchers argue that this plan would harm their already struggling industry, with some calling it a "slap in the face." They contend that the high beef prices are not their fault and point to the consolidation of the meatpacking industry as a major factor. Economists are skeptical that Argentina has sufficient supply to significantly impact U.S. prices. In response to the backlash, the Department of Agriculture announced initiatives to support domestic ranchers, though concerns about foreign imports remain. This situation highlights a conflict between the administration's economic policies and the interests of a key voting bloc.
