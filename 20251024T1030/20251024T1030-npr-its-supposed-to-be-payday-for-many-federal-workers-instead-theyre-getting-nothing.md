## Article summary
Many federal workers are facing financial hardship due to a government shutdown, with some lined up for food assistance. Despite it being payday, approximately 1.4 million civilian federal employees are not receiving pay, with about half furloughed and the other half deemed essential but still unpaid. This financial strain is taking a toll on their mental health and ability to provide for their families. Some federal workers are resorting to loans and hardship withdrawals from retirement funds to cope. Credit unions are offering short-term, interest-free loans to affected employees, and emergency funds are being depleted by increasing requests for help with basic necessities like rent and utilities. While some federal employees, like military personnel and certain law enforcement officers, are still being paid through alternative funding, many others are not. The shutdown's economic impact is also beginning to affect local communities with high concentrations of federal workers. President Trump has suggested that not all furloughed workers may receive back pay, despite a 2019 law ensuring it.
