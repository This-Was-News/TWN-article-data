## Article summary
The federal government shutdown is in its second week, with no clear end in sight. Tours at the Capitol have stopped, and the House is closed, while the Senate is stuck in a loop of failed votes. President Donald Trump has threatened to fire federal workers and withhold back pay. The core issue is the debate over health care subsidies, particularly those related to the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans, who control Congress, believe they have the upper hand, while Democrats are convinced they have public support. Behind the scenes, some senators are discussing potential solutions, but public negotiations are not underway. Trump has signaled openness to negotiating health care subsidies but later shifted his stance, demanding the government reopen first. Democrats argue that Republicans failed to address the health care issue earlier in the year. The shutdown is expected to impact tens of millions of people facing increased health insurance costs. Both parties are framing the shutdown as a precursor to the 2026 midterm elections, with each side convinced they are on the right side of the issue.
