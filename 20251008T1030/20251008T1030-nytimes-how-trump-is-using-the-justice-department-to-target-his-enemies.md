## Article summary
Donald Trump, since his campaign to return to the White House, has expressed a desire to seek vengeance against his enemies, using the Justice Department to target them. Critics argue that Trump has weaponized the department more directly than any president since Nixon, eroding its independence and threatening the rule of law. The Justice Department, now led by Trump's former personal lawyers, has fired dozens of career prosecutors and targeted several U.S. attorneys. Trump has pursued various adversaries, including James Comey, Letitia James, Adam Schiff, John Bolton, John Brennan, Fani Willis, and the Open Society Foundations. Each target has denied wrongdoing. Comey is charged with lying to Congress and obstructing proceedings, James and Schiff are investigated for potential mortgage fraud, Bolton is investigated for mishandling classified material, Brennan's allegations are related to Russian election interference, Willis is investigated for travel records, and the Open Society Foundations are scrutinized for possible charges ranging from arson to terrorism. Trump's actions are seen as retaliation for past investigations and criticisms.
