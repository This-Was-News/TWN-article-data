## Article summary
President Donald Trump has sent or proposed sending National Guard troops to several U.S. cities, including Chicago and Portland, amidst ongoing political and legal disputes with local Democratic officials. In Chicago, around 300 Illinois National Guard troops and 400 from Texas are set to be federalized and deployed, though the exact timing remains uncertain. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has criticized the plan, calling it unlawful and dangerous, while Trump argues the troops are necessary to support federal immigration enforcement and combat crime. The ACLU of Illinois has filed a lawsuit against Trump and the Department of Homeland Security, alleging violence and intimidation against protesters and journalists. In Portland, Oregon, a legal battle continues over the deployment of National Guard troops, with Oregon Governor Tina Kotek opposing the move. Meanwhile, in Memphis, Tennessee, National Guard troops are expected to arrive soon, with the support of Governor Bill Lee, to assist local law enforcement in crime-fighting efforts.
