## Article summary
Judge Michael Nachmanoff, known for his methodical approach and cool temperament, will preside over the case against former FBI director James Comey. Nachmanoff, a former public defender turned judge, was randomly assigned the case after Comey's indictment on charges including obstruction of a congressional proceeding. Despite political noise, lawyers who know Nachmanoff believe he will not be swayed by politics. Nachmanoff has a reputation for fairness and independence, having handled politically sensitive cases in the past. He is respected for his thorough preparation and even-handed conduct in the courtroom. Comey was charged with lying to Congress, and Trump has publicly urged his prosecution. Nachmanoff's background as a public defender and his record of constitutional rigor suggest he will approach the case with impartiality. The clash between Trump and Comey has been ongoing since Trump fired Comey in 2017. Comey has expressed confidence in the judicial system and his innocence. Nachmanoff's involvement is seen as a safeguard against partisan political attacks.
