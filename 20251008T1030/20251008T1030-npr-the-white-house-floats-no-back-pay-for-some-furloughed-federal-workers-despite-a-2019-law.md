## Article summary
President Trump has suggested that some of the approximately 600,000 furloughed federal workers may not receive back pay after the government reopens, despite a 2019 law guaranteeing their compensation. Trump's comments align with a draft White House memo that argues for denying workers pay, although he claims to follow the law. The memo contradicts existing guidance and the 2019 Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, which automatically ensures back pay for federal employees after a shutdown. The White House memo argues that congressional action is required to enact back pay, a stance criticized by Democrats as lawless. The draft memo is part of a broader White House campaign to pressure Democrats during the shutdown, including threats to cancel grant funding and reduce federal workforce. House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged potential legal justifications, while Sen. Patty Murray condemned the move as contrary to the law's clear text.
