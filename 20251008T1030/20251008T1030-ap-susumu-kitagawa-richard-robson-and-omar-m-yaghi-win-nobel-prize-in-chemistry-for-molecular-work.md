## Article summary
Scientists Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for developing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), structures with large internal spaces that can absorb and contain gases. These MOFs, likened to Hermione Granger's enchanted handbag, have practical applications like capturing carbon dioxide and extracting water from desert air. The laureates, working independently but building on each other's breakthroughs, created stable MOFs with potential for custom-made materials. The 2024 prize was also awarded to David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for their work on protein design using AI. The Nobel announcements continue with the literature, peace, and economics prizes to be revealed. The award ceremony will be held on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.
