## Article summary
James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, is set to appear in court on charges of lying to Congress five years ago. The case, deemed too thin by a previous federal prosecutor, was pursued despite opposition from prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia. The indictment was presented to a grand jury on Sept. 25 by Lindsey Halligan, a White House official installed by President Trump. The case has significant political and legal implications, as Comey was instrumental in investigating Trump's campaign connections to Russia in 2016. The arraignment will follow standard court procedures, but the context is highly unusual. The proceedings will take place at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va., and will involve Comey hearing the charges against him and signing the necessary paperwork. The case represents the most significant legal action taken against those President Trump has publicly targeted for retribution.
