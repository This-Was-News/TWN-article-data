## Article summary
The government shutdown is causing significant disruptions in air travel across the U.S., with air traffic control staffing shortages leading to flight delays and cancellations. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed the delays to increased sick calls by air traffic controllers, who are concerned about working without pay. The FAA has slowed traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations, and politicians are blaming each other for the shutdown. Long-standing staffing shortages in the air traffic control sector have exacerbated the problem. Major airports, including Newark, Denver, and Hollywood Burbank, experienced significant delays. Hollywood Burbank Airport had no air traffic controllers for over five hours, leading to average ground delays of two and a half hours. The shutdown also threatens the Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes commercial service to rural airports, potentially impacting hundreds of daily flights and thousands of jobs. The situation highlights the fragility of the aviation system and the urgent need for accelerated hiring and training of air traffic controllers.
