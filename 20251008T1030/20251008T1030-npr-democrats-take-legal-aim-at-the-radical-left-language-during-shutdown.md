## Article summary
Legal challenges are emerging against the Trump administration for using language on federal websites and emails that blames Democrats for the government shutdown. The controversial language, such as 'the Radical Left Democrat Shutdown,' is argued to violate the Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan activity by executive branch employees. A complaint has been filed by former Idaho Democratic legislator Todd Achilles, citing the use of public infrastructure for political messaging. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel is currently unable to address the complaint due to the government shutdown. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, has not responded to requests for comment but has used similar language in its automated emails. The American Federation of Government Employees has sued the U.S. Department of Education and sent a cease and desist letter over similar emails. Retired federal land managers express concern that the language creates a negative atmosphere for civil servants, many of whom are facing layoffs or early retirement due to the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal bureaucracy. Former deputy director of the Bureau of Land Management, Steve Ellis, emphasizes that partisan political messages have no place on agency websites.
