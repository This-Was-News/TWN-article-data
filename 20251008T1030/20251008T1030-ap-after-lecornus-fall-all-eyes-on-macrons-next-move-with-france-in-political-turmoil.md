## Article summary
French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu resigned, triggering a political crisis. President Emmanuel Macron gave Lecornu 48 hours to negotiate with political parties to stabilize the situation. The coalition between Macron's centrists and conservatives collapsed, failing to secure parliamentary backing for the 2026 budget. Far-right leaders Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella rejected talks, demanding snap elections, while the far-left France Unbowed also boycotted negotiations. Macron, with low approval ratings, faces limited options: calling new elections, appointing an external prime minister, or resigning. The left advocates for cohabitation, where a prime minister from another party governs with parliamentary backing. Macron could dissolve the National Assembly, but this risks deepening divisions. The National Rally sees snap elections as an opportunity to gain power. Lecornu hopes for a compromise to avoid elections and secure the budget. Macron's term ends in 2027, but some, including former ally Édouard Philippe, suggest he should resign and call an early presidential election. Only one French president has resigned since 1958.
