## Article summary
Attorney General Pam Bondi testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a contentious hearing where she clashed with Democrats over her handling of politically sensitive cases and the independence of the Justice Department. Democrats accused Bondi of failing to uphold her promise of an independent Justice Department, with Senator Richard J. Durbin criticizing her actions. Bondi defended President Trump's decisions, including sending National Guard troops to Chicago, and refused to disclose details about the dropped investigation of Tom Homan, who accepted $50,000 in cash. The hearing also touched on the Epstein case, with Senator John Kennedy questioning Bondi about the administration's position and the lack of interviews with Howard Lutnick, a former neighbor of Epstein. Republicans focused on accusations of phone record surveillance by former special counsel Jack Smith, denouncing it as spying. Senator Josh Hawley claimed his phone was tapped, though the records did not include call content. Republicans called for a new special counsel to investigate Smith, while Democrats concentrated on Bondi's handling of various cases.
