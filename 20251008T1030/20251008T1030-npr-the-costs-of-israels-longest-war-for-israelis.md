## Article summary
The article discusses the profound impacts of Israel's prolonged war with Hamas on Israeli society, marking two years since the October 7, 2023, attacks. Families of hostages held in Gaza protest outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home, demanding a deal to free their loved ones. The war has eroded national unity, with a recent poll showing 66% of Israelis wanting it to end. Mental health issues have surged, with increased use of anti-anxiety medications and trauma among soldiers and civilians. The war has also led to a loss of empathy for Palestinian suffering among some Israelis, despite efforts by researchers to restore it. Internationally, Israel faces accusations of genocide and war crimes, with protests and travel restrictions affecting Israelis abroad. The article highlights the personal and psychological costs of the war, including the trauma experienced by soldiers and the societal divisions it has exacerbated. As the war continues, Israelis grapple with its long-term consequences and the hope for a peaceful resolution.
