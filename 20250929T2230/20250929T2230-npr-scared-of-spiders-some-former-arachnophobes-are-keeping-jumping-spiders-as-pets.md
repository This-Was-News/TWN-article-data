## Article summary
Jumping spiders have become popular pets, especially among women, with many breeders reporting high demand. These spiders, known for their cuteness and unique personalities, are helping former arachnophobes overcome their fears. Breeders like Sunday Costell and Heather Mulligan have seen a surge in interest, with some selling thousands of spiders weekly. The spiders come in various colors and can change appearance during molts. Despite their small brains, jumping spiders exhibit complex behaviors, including hunting strategies and recognition of quantities. They are relatively easy to care for, requiring small enclosures and live prey. While they can bite if provoked, bites are rare and similar to a bee sting. Jumping spiders typically live about one to two years and are not prone to getting lost. Their growing popularity has led to their availability in stores like PetSmart, making them more accessible to potential owners.
