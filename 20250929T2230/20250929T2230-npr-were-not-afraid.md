## Article summary
The Open Society Foundations (OSF), founded by billionaire George Soros, is facing potential investigation by the U.S. government after President Trump identified Soros as a likely candidate for prosecution. OSF president Binaifer Nowrojee emphasized that the foundation's activities are legal and peaceful, and that the threat is part of a broader erosion of democracy. Nowrojee, who grew up under dictatorship in Kenya, warned against the dangers of such actions. The OSF has supported various causes, including human rights and civic engagement, and has faced similar political attacks in other countries, such as Hungary. Despite these challenges, Nowrojee affirmed that the OSF remains committed to its mission and values. The foundation's work includes funding activists, universities, and journalists, with recipients ranging from the ACLU to NPR. Nowrojee rejected the label of 'liberal' for their work, stating their goal is to ensure all people can engage in governance and hold their governments accountable. Trump's focus on Soros and his foundations has been ongoing, with some critics driven by Soros' Jewish identity. The OSF was eventually forced to withdraw from Hungary due to political targeting, but Nowrojee declared that they are not afraid and will continue their mission in the U.S.
