## Article summary
A deadly shooting occurred at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, during a Sunday service. A former Marine, identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, crashed a pickup into the church, shot into the building, and set it on fire. Four people were killed, and eight were wounded by gunfire. Officers arrived within 30 seconds and shot the attacker. The attack was the latest in a series of shootings at houses of worship in the U.S. and the second mass shooting in less than 24 hours. The attacker's motive remains unclear, but officials suggest he may have targeted the Mormon faith. The FBI is leading the investigation, considering it an act of targeted violence, with 100 agents deployed to the scene. The church building was severely damaged by fire, and the attacker's truck remained at the scene. The Mormon church has nearly 47,000 members in Michigan. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities searching the attacker's residence for further clues.
