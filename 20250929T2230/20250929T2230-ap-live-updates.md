## Article summary
President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have agreed on a plan to end the war in Gaza, though Hamas's acceptance remains uncertain. The 20-point plan aims to establish postwar governance in Gaza without requiring residents to leave, and calls for an immediate ceasefire if both sides agree. The Palestinian Authority, led by rivals of Hamas, has welcomed the plan and pledged reforms to potentially establish a Palestinian state. The proposal also demands the release of all remaining hostages within 72 hours of Israels acceptance. Meanwhile, Democratic leaders are pushing for health insurance tax credits to be included in government funding talks, while Republicans prefer to address it separately. The plan includes a temporary governing board headed by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Several foreign ministers expressed confidence in Trumps ability to find a path to peace but did not fully endorse the plan. The Palestinian government also welcomed Trumps efforts and pledged reforms. However, the plan faces significant challenges, including opposition from Israels hard-line government and the uncertain future of Gaza under international oversight. The plan also includes provisions for amnesty for Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and safe passage for those who wish to leave Gaza. The White House released the plan on Monday, but its acceptance by both Israel and Hamas remains unclear. The plan has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising Trumps initiative and others expressing skepticism about its implementation.
