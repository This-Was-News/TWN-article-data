## Article summary
President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a U.S. plan to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of remaining hostages. The 20-point plan aims to immediately halt Israel's military operations, boost aid to Gaza, and require Hamas to release hostages within 48 hours. The plan includes a Trump economic development initiative to rebuild Gaza and create a special economic zone. Netanyahu expressed support for the plan, which he believes achieves Israel's war aims. Hamas has not yet accepted the proposal and has resisted specific measures outlined. The plan ensures Palestinians will not be forced to leave Gaza and encourages them to help rebuild. Trump expects Hamas to accept the plan but warned that if they reject it, Israel will have his full backing to destroy Hamas. The plan also includes provisions for the release of Palestinian prisoners, the establishment of a temporary governance committee, and the creation of an International Stabilization Force to ensure security. The ultimate goal is to create a deradicalized, terror-free Gaza that can coexist peacefully with its neighbors.
