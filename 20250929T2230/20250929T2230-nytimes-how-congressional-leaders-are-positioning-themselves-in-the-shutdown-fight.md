## Article summary
Congressional leaders face high stakes in a spending standoff threatening a government shutdown. Senator John Thune, as Republican majority leader, navigates his first major spending showdown. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, aims to maintain his narrow House majority amid political risks. Democrats Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries seek to demonstrate their willingness to challenge President Trump. The four leaders will meet with Trump to address the shutdown deadline, with federal funding set to lapse soon. Schumer leverages health care issues, arguing Democrats have a mandate to demand G.O.P. concessions. Thune accuses Democrats of holding the government hostage and must rally Republican support for any deal. Jeffries, in his first high-stakes confrontation with Trump, frames the showdown as an opportunity to highlight G.O.P. allegiance to Trump. Johnson successfully passed a stopgap funding bill, forcing Senate Democrats to act. The outcome hinges on negotiations and the ability to avoid a shutdown.
