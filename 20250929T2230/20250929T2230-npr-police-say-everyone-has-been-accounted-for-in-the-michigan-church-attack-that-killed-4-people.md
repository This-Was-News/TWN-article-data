## Article summary
A deadly attack at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, left four people and the suspect dead, with eight others injured. Authorities confirmed that everyone has been accounted for, though the search of the church is not yet complete. The suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, a 40-year-old Marine veteran, rammed his truck through the church doors, fired an assault rifle, and set the building on fire. Police responded within 30 seconds and killed Sanford in a shootout within eight minutes. The FBI is investigating the attack as targeted violence. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expressed grief over the shooting, noting the increasing frequency of mass shootings in public places. The Grand Blanc Community Schools System closed all campuses. Eight victims, aged 6 to 78, were treated at Henry Ford Genesys Hospital, including five with gunshot wounds. Some hospital staff members, who were also church members, treated their injured friends and family. Sanford served in the Marine Corps and completed a tour in Iraq. Authorities have not yet determined his motive.
