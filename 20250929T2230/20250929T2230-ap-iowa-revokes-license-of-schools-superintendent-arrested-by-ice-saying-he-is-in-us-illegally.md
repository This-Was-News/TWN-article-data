## Article summary
The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked the professional license of Des Moines public schools Superintendent Ian Roberts after his arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for allegedly living and working in the country illegally. Roberts, a native of Guyana, entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999 and was detained following a traffic stop. He was found with a loaded handgun, a hunting knife, and $3,000 cash. The school district claimed they were unaware of his immigration status and had conducted background checks during his hiring in 2023. Roberts, known for his community involvement and two-decade career in education, was placed on paid administrative leave. The Des Moines school board is considering changing his leave status to unpaid following the license revocation. ICE is investigating how Roberts obtained a handgun, as individuals in the country illegally are ineligible to possess firearms. Roberts had a prior citation for storing a loaded hunting rifle in his vehicle and a pending weapons charge from 2020.
