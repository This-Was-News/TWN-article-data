## Article summary
A recent web page discusses the ongoing government shutdown negotiations between Congress and Republicans, who are spreading a misleading claim that Democrats are shutting down the government to fund free health care for unauthorized immigrants. The Democrats' budget proposal aims to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies and roll back Medicaid cuts, but it does not provide free health care for unauthorized immigrants, who are largely ineligible for federally funded health care programs. Republicans may be referring to changes in eligibility requirements for certain lawfully present immigrants under the tax cut and domestic policy law, which the Democrats' proposal seeks to restore. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 1.2 million people would lose subsidies due to eligibility restrictions, but did not characterize them as illegal or unauthorized. The federal government reimburses hospitals for emergency care to low-income unauthorized immigrants, and several states provide government-funded health care to low-income children and adults regardless of immigration status. The web page clarifies that these state-funded programs are not affected by the current federal funding debate.
