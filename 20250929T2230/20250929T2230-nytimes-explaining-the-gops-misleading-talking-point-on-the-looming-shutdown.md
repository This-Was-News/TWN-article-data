## Article summary
Republicans have falsely claimed that Democrats are shutting down the government to fund free health care for unauthorized immigrants. This claim has been repeated by Vice President JD Vance, Senate Republicans, and Speaker Mike Johnson. The Democrats' budget proposal aims to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies and roll back Medicaid cuts but does not provide free health care for unauthorized immigrants. Unauthorized immigrants are largely barred from federally funded health care programs and cannot receive subsidies or be eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, or CHIP. Republicans may be referring to changes in eligibility requirements for certain lawfully present immigrants, which the Democrats' proposal seeks to restore. The term 'lawful presence' includes various immigrant groups, some with more complicated legal statuses. Republican committee chairmen claimed the Biden administration abused these definitions, citing a C.B.O. analysis that estimated 1.2 million people would lose subsidies due to eligibility restrictions. The federal government reimburses hospitals for emergency care for low-income unauthorized immigrants, though funding was reduced by the Republican tax law. Several states provide government-funded health care for low-income children and adults regardless of immigration status, but these programs are state-funded and unaffected by current federal debates. Earlier versions of the Republican tax bill included cuts to these state programs, but these were removed due to Senate rules.
