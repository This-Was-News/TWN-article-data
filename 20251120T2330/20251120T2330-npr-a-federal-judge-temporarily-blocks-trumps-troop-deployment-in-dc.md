## Article summary
A federal judge has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., deeming the action "unlawful." U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that President Trump's deployment of troops to the nation's capital to combat crime undermined the city's autonomy and potentially stirred tensions. This decision marks the latest legal challenge to Trump's use of federal troops in American cities. The judge sided with the District of Columbia Attorney General, who argued the deployment harmed the city's public safety and economy. Cobb has paused her order until December 11th to allow for an appeal. The White House maintains that Trump acted within his authority, calling the lawsuit an attempt to undermine crime-fighting operations. Trump deployed hundreds of troops to D.C. in August, citing a "crime emergency," a claim disputed by local leaders. Since their deployment, Guard members have been involved in patrols and beautification efforts. The deployment currently includes over 2,100 Guard forces from D.C. and several other states.
