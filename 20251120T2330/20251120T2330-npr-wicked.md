## Article summary
Jon M. Chu's 'Wicked: For Good,' the second installment of the musical adaptation, concludes the story but struggles to justify its own full-length movie. While the film is made with evident love and commitment to the source material, it suffers from over-padding to stretch the narrative across two parts. The story picks up with Elphaba, now an outlaw, and her friend Glinda, who has aligned with the Wizard's regime. The film features a strong opening sequence depicting the oppression of animals and Elphaba's defiance. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande deliver captivating performances, with their chemistry shining brightest in their shared scenes, particularly their duet "For Good." However, the musical numbers in this installment, including two new songs, do not match the impact of the first part, and the political commentary is less incisive than in the original novel. Despite its flaws, 'Wicked: For Good' is considered a triumph within the landscape of movie musicals, showcasing the dedication of its cast and crew.
