## Article summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has altered its website, now suggesting that a link between childhood vaccines and autism cannot be ruled out. This change reverses the CDC's long-standing position, which was supported by extensive scientific research debunking such a connection. Public health experts are alarmed by this shift, fearing it will exacerbate vaccine hesitancy and lead to a resurgence of preventable childhood diseases like measles. Organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Autism Science Foundation have criticized the CDC's new stance, emphasizing the overwhelming scientific consensus against a vaccine-autism link. The Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson stated that studies have not ruled out the possibility and that a comprehensive assessment of autism causes is underway. Critics argue the new wording is intentionally confusing and misrepresents scientific evidence. This change reportedly blindsided career scientists at the CDC and raises concerns about the credibility of the agency's vaccine information. These actions are seen as part of a broader pattern of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s initiatives that challenge mainstream medical and scientific consensus on vaccine safety. Proposed changes by a new advisory committee, including removing thimerosal and aluminum adjuvants, and separating the MMR vaccine, are also viewed as scientifically unsound and potentially harmful to public health.
