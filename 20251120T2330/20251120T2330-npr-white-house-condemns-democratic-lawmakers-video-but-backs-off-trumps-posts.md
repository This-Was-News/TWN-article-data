## Article summary
President Trump has labeled a video by Democratic lawmakers as "seditious behavior, punishable by DEATH!" The video, featuring veterans in Congress, states that members of the military can and must refuse illegal orders. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that Trump does not actually want members of Congress executed, but believes the lawmakers' message undermines the military chain of command. The Democratic lawmakers, all with military backgrounds, argued that the current administration is creating divisions and that threats to the Constitution exist domestically. They emphasized that military and intelligence personnel swear an oath to the Constitution and are not obligated to carry out illegal orders. In response to Trump's posts, the lawmakers released a statement reaffirming their oath to the Constitution and condemning the President's calls for violence. House Democratic leadership has called on Trump to remove his posts and for Republicans to condemn his rhetoric, citing concerns for the safety of the lawmakers and their families.
