## Article summary
President Donald Trump has accused six Democratic lawmakers of sedition punishable by death for releasing a video urging U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy illegal orders. The video, posted by Senator Elissa Slotkin, featured Slotkin, Senators Mark Kelly, and Representatives Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan. Trump reposted the video with his own commentary, calling the lawmakers traitors and demanding their arrest and trial. He stated their actions were seditious behavior punishable by death, echoing sentiments from some of his supporters. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested the Democrats' message could be punishable by law, emphasizing the danger of inciting defiance of lawful orders. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that Trump's rhetoric was dangerous, while Speaker Mike Johnson stated he did not believe Trump was calling for violence but found the video inappropriate. Trump allies, like Stephen Miller, described the video as an insurrection and a call for rebellion. Conversely, some national security experts and the Pentagon maintained that military members are trained to refuse illegal orders, a fundamental aspect of military doctrine. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell asserted that the military follows orders and that civilian leaders issue legal orders.
