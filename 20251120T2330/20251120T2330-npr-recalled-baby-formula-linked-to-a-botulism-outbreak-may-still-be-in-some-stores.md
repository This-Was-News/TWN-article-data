## Article summary
ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula has been recalled nationwide due to a botulism outbreak that has sickened over two dozen babies in 15 states. While no deaths have been reported, all 31 affected infants were hospitalized with symptoms of gradual paralysis. The FDA has linked the outbreak to ByHeart formula, prompting the company to recall all of its products, including cans and single-serve packets sold at major retailers and online. Despite the recall, federal health officials have reported that the affected formula may still be found on store shelves. ByHeart is cooperating with the FDA's investigation and has apologized to parents, urging them to stop using the formula and monitor their babies for botulism symptoms. Botulism in infants is caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, which can lead to severe paralysis and breathing difficulties if untreated. The company is conducting its own testing and has provided resources for customers, including a support hotline and refunds. Several lawsuits have been filed against ByHeart, alleging negligence and deceptive marketing. The FDA is working with retailers to ensure an effective recall and continues its investigation into the outbreak.
