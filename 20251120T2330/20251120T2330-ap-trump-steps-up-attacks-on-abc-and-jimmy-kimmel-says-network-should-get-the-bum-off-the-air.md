## Article summary
President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of ABC News and its late-night host, Jimmy Kimmel. Trump publicly urged ABC to remove Kimmel from the air, calling him "a man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS." This escalation follows Trump's earlier anger towards ABC's chief White House correspondent, Mary Bruce, for her questions during an Oval Office briefing. The White House press office also issued a lengthy memo detailing grievances against ABC News, labeling it a "Democrat spin operation." Kimmel's show had recently featured a monologue critical of Trump, referencing the Jeffrey Epstein case and Congress's vote to release more of Epstein's correspondence. Trump's attacks on Kimmel are not new; ABC had previously suspended the host for remarks made after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel's show experienced a ratings boost upon his return after the temporary suspension. Trump also recently called for the firing of NBC's Seth Meyers. The Epstein case appears to be a particularly sensitive topic for Trump, who also recently insulted a Bloomberg News reporter. ABC News has stated it will not comment on Trump's remarks regarding Kimmel.
