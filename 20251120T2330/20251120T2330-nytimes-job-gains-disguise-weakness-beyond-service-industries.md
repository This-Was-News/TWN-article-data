## Article summary
The September jobs report showed a respectable month of hiring, adding 119,000 jobs, which was more than double what forecasters expected. This positive hiring figure helped to alleviate concerns that the labor market might be contracting. However, the report also revealed a mixed picture, with the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.4 percent as more people entered the workforce seeking employment. The data, delayed by six weeks due to a government shutdown, offers an outdated view of a labor market that had been showing signs of weakness. Federal layoffs and inconsistent tariff policies have contributed to this sputtering. The upcoming release of October and November figures will be crucial, especially as the Federal Reserve considers interest rate decisions. Mixed signals from the September report, which also diverge from some private sector indicators, could complicate the Federal Reserve's decision-making process. Economists note that the report adds to the existing uncertainty surrounding the labor market's direction. Revisions to previous months' job gains were also slightly downward, making the September acceleration appear more significant than it was.
