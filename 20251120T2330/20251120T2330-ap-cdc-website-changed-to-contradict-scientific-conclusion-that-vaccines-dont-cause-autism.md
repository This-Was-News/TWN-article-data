## Article summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website has been updated to suggest a potential link between vaccines and autism, contradicting decades of scientific consensus. This change has sparked outrage among public health and autism experts who emphasize that widespread scientific evidence firmly concludes no such link exists. The Autism Science Foundation expressed dismay, calling the revised content "anti-vaccine rhetoric and outright lies." The American Academy of Pediatrics president urged the CDC to cease amplifying false claims that undermine routine immunizations. Historically, the CDC has promoted vaccines by stating their safety and lack of connection to autism. However, under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, there has been a push to re-examine vaccine safety. It remains unclear if CDC personnel were involved in the website change or if it was directed by HHS leadership, including Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long advocated for a vaccine-autism connection. Some former CDC officials expressed concerns that the agency's scientific integrity is compromised, with one stating that decisions are now "decision-based evidence making" rather than "evidence-based decision making." An HHS spokesman stated the website is being updated to reflect "gold standard, evidence-based science" and that a comprehensive assessment of autism causes is underway. Despite the changes, a headline on the CDC page still states vaccines do not cause autism, but an asterisk and a note indicate an agreement to keep the phrasing due to a Senate committee's request.
