## Article summary
Stocks experienced a significant downturn on Thursday, reversing early gains as concerns about the valuation of artificial intelligence companies resurfaced. Initially, the market showed optimism following positive earnings reports from tech giant Nvidia and retail bellwether Walmart, which had offered a brief respite from recent market volatility. However, this bullish sentiment quickly evaporated by the afternoon, leading to widespread selling pressure. The S&P 500, after an early rally of up to 1.9 percent, ultimately closed 1.6 percent lower, marking a reversal of over 3 percent from its peak. Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw its initial gains of over 5 percent erased, finishing the day down more than 3 percent, with rival Advanced Micro Devices and other tech stocks also declining. Investors had entered the week on edge, with the AI-driven stock rally showing signs of fatigue and questions arising about whether investment in the sector had become excessive. Worries about the financial health of lower-income consumers and uncertainty surrounding potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts also contributed to market anxiety. The S&P 500 has now fallen over 5 percent since reaching a new high on October 28, with technology stocks leading the decline.
