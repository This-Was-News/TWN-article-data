## Article summary
Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., was officially sworn into Congress on Wednesday, 50 days after winning her seat. She believes her support for releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files contributed to the delay in her seating, which denied representation to over 800,000 Arizonans. Grijalva fulfilled a campaign promise by becoming the decisive 218th signature on a bipartisan petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files. Her swearing-in occurred as new emails raised questions about President Trump's relationship with Epstein. Democrats accused House Speaker Mike Johnson of stalling the swearing-in to avoid the Epstein files vote, though Johnson denied these accusations. Grijalva won her special election on September 23rd to represent Arizona's 7th Congressional District. During the delay, Grijalva and other Democrats actively sought to meet with Speaker Johnson. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the delays "unbelievable" but stated they are now over. Grijalva plans to vote against the bipartisan plan to reopen the government, citing insufficient concessions for healthcare. With Grijalva's swearing-in, the GOP's majority in the House has narrowed to 219-214, meaning they can now only afford to lose two votes on any given measure.
