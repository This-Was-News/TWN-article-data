## Article summary
In Chicago's Latino neighborhoods, a federal immigration crackdown has instilled fear, causing streets and businesses to empty. In response, residents have organized creative "buyout" events to support street vendors and local restaurants. Cyclists, for instance, ride at sunrise to purchase entire stocks of tamales, elote, and sweets, then donate the food to those in need. These efforts aim to provide vendors with a day of rest and security, allowing them to avoid the risks associated with working amidst the crackdown. Community organizers are also arranging restaurant crawls to boost sales for struggling eateries. The detentions of vendors, including a tamale seller, a flower seller, and a cotton candy vendor, have highlighted the cultural and economic impact of losing these small businesses. Organizations like the Street Vendors Association of Chicago are raising funds to provide financial support to affected vendors. The community's response has been emotional, revealing the deep love and support vendors have from their neighbors. Initiatives like "Operation Buyout" provide direct financial assistance and even essential equipment, like a bakery mixer, to help vendors continue their livelihoods with a greater sense of security. The fear of detention weighs heavily on vendors, some of whom worry about leaving their families behind. These grassroots efforts demonstrate a powerful solidarity, offering a glimmer of hope and a "day without fear" for those most affected by the immigration crackdown.
