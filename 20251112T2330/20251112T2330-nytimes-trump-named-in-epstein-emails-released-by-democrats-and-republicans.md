## Article summary
A trove of over 20,000 emails released by lawmakers has brought Jeffrey Epstein's past communications back into the spotlight, with several messages mentioning President Trump. One email from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell in 2011 suggested Trump spent hours with a victim at his house and had never been mentioned, a claim Republicans on the House Oversight Committee identified as referring to Virginia Roberts Giuffre. In another 2019 email, Epstein told an associate that Trump knew about "the girls" and asked Ghislaine Maxwell to stop. The White House, including Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, has dismissed the emails as a distraction and a hoax, asserting that Trump did nothing wrong. President Trump himself has blamed Democrats for the release, calling it a tactic to deflect from their own political failures. Meanwhile, a discharge petition in the House, which would force a vote on releasing Justice Department files related to Epstein, has gained the necessary 218 signatures, with the final signature provided by newly sworn-in Representative Adelita Grijalva. This maneuver has created a rift within the Republican party, as some members are torn between loyalty to Trump and constituent demands for transparency. Author Michael Wolff also appears in the emails, having advised Epstein on how to handle his relationship with Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, suggesting Epstein could gain political cover by becoming an anti-Trump voice. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is also mentioned, with Epstein offering advice on his interactions with a woman in London, and Epstein also described Trump as "borderline insane" in an email to Summers. Despite the White House's efforts to block a vote on releasing the Epstein files, the discharge petition's progression suggests a House vote is likely in early December.
