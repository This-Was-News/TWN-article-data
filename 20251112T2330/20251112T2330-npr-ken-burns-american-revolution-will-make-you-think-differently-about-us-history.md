## Article summary
Ken Burns' new six-part PBS series, *The American Revolution*, revisits familiar territory for the acclaimed documentary filmmaker, who previously explored topics like the Civil War, World War II, and the Vietnam War. Burns employs his signature techniques, including evocative music, historical quotations read by actors, and detailed sound effects, to bring the founding of the United States to life. Lacking photographs from the era, the series innovatively uses war re-enactors, focusing on intense close-ups of body parts and employing drone footage to capture battles from unique perspectives. The documentary delves deeply into individual battles, using animated maps to clarify troop movements, with narration by Peter Coyote. A key strength of *The American Revolution* is its focus on both prominent figures like George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, and the often-overlooked voices of Native Americans, revolutionary women, and enslaved people. The series also encourages viewers to reconsider historical perspectives, humanizing figures on both the Patriot and Loyalist sides, and explaining the motivations of Native tribes who allied with the British. Ultimately, *The American Revolution* highlights the arduous fight for a Federalist society and suggests the ongoing quest for a more perfect union.
