## Article summary
Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released emails suggesting that President Trump had more knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's activities than he has publicly admitted. One email from 2011, sent by Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, references a victim who spent hours at Epstein's house with Trump, stating that Trump had never mentioned the victim. Republicans, however, argue that the emails offer little new information and are a distraction. In 2015, Epstein and journalist Michael Wolff discussed how Epstein could leverage Trump's potential media appearances regarding their relationship. Wolff suggested Epstein could use Trump's statements to his advantage, or even save him if Trump appeared to be winning. In 2019, Epstein explicitly told Wolff, "of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop." Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a victim who went public in 2011, stated in a 2016 civil case deposition that she did not believe Donald Trump participated in any abuse. While Epstein was socializing with notable figures during the 2016 presidential campaign, including Michael Wolff, Trump did not field questions about Epstein during a presidential debate that year. The Miami Herald's reporting in 2019 brought renewed attention to Epstein's past plea deal, leading to a Justice Department investigation into how it was handled.
