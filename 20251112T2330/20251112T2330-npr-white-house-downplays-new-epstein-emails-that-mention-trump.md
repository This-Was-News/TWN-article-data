## Article summary
Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released new emails from Jeffrey Epstein's estate that mention President Trump, raising questions about their relationship. Republicans countered by releasing over 20,000 documents, including Epstein's correspondence expressing displeasure with Trump's presidency. One email from 2015 discusses how to handle questions about Trump and Epstein's ties, suggesting a strategy to "hang him." Another 2011 email refers to Trump as the "dog that hasn't barked" and mentions him spending time at Epstein's house with alleged victims. A 2019 message suggests Epstein believed Trump was aware of the "girls." Epstein also wrote in 2017 that Trump had "not one decent cell in his body." The White House dismissed the emails as a "fake narrative" and a "hoax" to smear Trump. This release follows previous revelations, including a birthday book with a drawing and letter appearing to be signed by Trump, which he called "fake." Trump has consistently denied a significant connection to Epstein, stating they fell out over employee poaching. The release of these files occurs as the House reconvenes, with ongoing efforts by some lawmakers to force a vote on releasing further Epstein-related documents.
