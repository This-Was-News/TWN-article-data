## Article summary
Democrat Adelita Grijalva was sworn into the U.S. House of Representatives, filling the seat previously held by her late father. Her induction occurred over seven weeks after she won a special election in Arizona. Shortly after being sworn in, Grijalva signed a discharge petition, securing the 218 signatures needed to trigger a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. This move brings the House's partisan majority to a slim 219-214 Republican advantage. Grijalva intends to uphold her father's legacy by advocating for progressive policies, including environmentalism, labor rights, and tribal sovereignty. Her seating was delayed, which Grijalva and other Democrats attributed to attempts to prevent her signature on the Epstein petition. House Speaker Mike Johnson had initially refused to swear her in while the chamber was out of session. Grijalva's arrival precedes a vote on a deal to fund the federal government, which she and most Democrats are expected to oppose. The release of the Epstein files is anticipated to be voted on in early December, following the release of emails suggesting Donald Trump's awareness of Epstein's activities. Grijalva, Arizona's first Latina congresswoman, has a background in local politics, having served on the Tucson Unified School District board and the Pima County Board of Supervisors.
