## Article summary
Israel's President Isaac Herzog has strongly condemned recent acts of settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, labeling them as shocking and serious. He called for decisive action from authorities to eradicate this phenomenon, stating it crosses a red line. This condemnation comes after dozens of masked Israeli settlers attacked two Palestinian villages, Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf, setting fire to vehicles and property, and clashing with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military's chief of staff and the chief of the Central Command echoed these sentiments, vowing to stop violent acts by settlers that tarnish the public image and divert military resources. The violence has surged since the war in Gaza began, with October seeing a record number of settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank. Palestinian officials and human rights workers accuse the Israeli army and police of failing to adequately address these attacks, which they believe are part of a campaign to displace Palestinians. Residents of the affected villages expressed their fear and frustration, highlighting the organized nature of the attacks. In parallel, UN officials welcomed the reopening of a crossing into northern Gaza but reiterated calls for increased humanitarian aid, noting shortages of essential supplies like baby formula and syringes. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasized the fragility of the Gaza ceasefire and appealed for its full respect to facilitate negotiations towards a two-state solution.
