## Article summary
Newly released emails reveal that former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers had a regular correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein between 2017 and 2019. The exchanges, some sent multiple times a day, suggest a closer relationship than previously understood. A significant portion of the emails focused on Mr. Summers's interactions with a woman in London, with Mr. Epstein offering advice and commentary, at times framing the situation as a "sport." In one instance, Mr. Summers sought Mr. Epstein's counsel on how to handle the woman's perceived busyness and potential involvement with another person. Mr. Epstein's replies, such as "annoyed shows caring., no whining showed strentgh," indicate his involvement in advising Mr. Summers. The emails also touched on President Trump, whom Mr. Epstein described as "borderline insane." These conversations occurred years after Mr. Epstein's 2008 guilty plea and amid renewed public attention due to investigations. Mr. Summers has previously expressed regret for his past associations with Mr. Epstein. The Wall Street Journal had previously reported on a 2014 exchange where Mr. Summers sought Mr. Epstein's advice on securing funding for a project involving his wife, Elisa New.
