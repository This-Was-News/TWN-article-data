## Article summary
President Donald Trump has proposed a "tariff dividend" of at least $2,000 per person, excluding high-income individuals, funded by the revenue generated from his tariffs. He claims these tariffs protect American industries, attract factories, and provide diplomatic leverage. However, budget experts and economists are skeptical of the plan's feasibility. They point out that the projected revenue from tariffs, while significant, is insufficient to cover the proposed dividend cost. For instance, analyst John Ricco estimates tariffs might bring in $200 billion to $300 billion annually, while a $2,000 dividend for all Americans would cost around $600 billion. Furthermore, implementing such a dividend would likely require congressional legislation, which is not guaranteed. Adding to the uncertainty, the legality of Trump's broad tariff powers is currently under review by the Supreme Court. If the court rules against the administration, importers might receive refunds rather than American families receiving dividends. Economists also argue that tariffs are ultimately paid by U.S. consumers through higher prices, suggesting that eliminating tariffs would be a more direct way to provide relief.
