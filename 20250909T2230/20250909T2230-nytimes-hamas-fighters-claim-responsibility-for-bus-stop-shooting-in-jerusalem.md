## Article summary
Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for a bus stop shooting in Jerusalem on Monday, which killed at least six people and wounded several others. The attack occurred ahead of Israel's anticipated offensive in Gaza. Shortly after Hamas' statement, Israel launched surprise strikes against Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, where they were considering a cease-fire proposal. The timing of these events left little doubt that peace between Israel and Hamas would remain elusive. Despite mediation efforts by the United States, Qatar, and other countries, cease-fire talks have stalled. Hamas stated that its operatives opened fire at an intersection in Ramot, a northern outskirt of Jerusalem, and claimed that two of its fighters were killed, while Israel reported seven fatalities. The shooting influenced Israel's decision to launch targeted strikes in Doha, drawing immediate backlash from other Arab countries in the region.
