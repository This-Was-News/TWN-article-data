## Article summary
Israel launched an airstrike in Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leadership, which threatened to destabilize Qatar's peace mediation efforts in the Gaza conflict. The strike hit a Hamas meeting discussing a cease-fire proposal backed by President Trump, killing several individuals, including a member of Qatar's internal security forces and injuring civilians. Qatar condemned the attack, vowing to continue its mediation role while forming a legal team to respond. President Trump stated that the U.S. was informed of the strike but could not prevent it, emphasizing Qatar's importance as a U.S. ally. The attack has strained diplomatic efforts and raised concerns about Israel's actions in the region, potentially undermining its relations with Gulf Arab nations. The strike also highlighted vulnerabilities in Gulf countries despite their investments in defense and hosting U.S. military presence. The U.N. secretary-general condemned the attack as a violation of Qatar's sovereignty, urging all parties to work towards a permanent cease-fire.
