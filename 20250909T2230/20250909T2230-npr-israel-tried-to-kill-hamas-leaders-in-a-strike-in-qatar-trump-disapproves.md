## Article summary
Israel launched a strike in Doha, Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leaders, resulting in international condemnation and disapproval from the U.S. The attack, which Israel claimed was aimed at leaders responsible for the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, led to several fatalities, including the son of Hamas' top negotiator. Qatar strongly denounced the strike, calling it a violation of international law and a threat to its security. President Trump criticized the timing and location of the strike, asserting that it undermined U.S. and Israeli goals. He also assured Qatar that such an attack would not happen again. The United Nations, European countries, and Arab states also condemned the attack. The strike occurred just months after an Iranian attack on a U.S. military base in Qatar, highlighting the region's ongoing tensions.
