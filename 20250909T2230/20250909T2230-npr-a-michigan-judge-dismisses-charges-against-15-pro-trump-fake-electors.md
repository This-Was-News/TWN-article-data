## Article summary
A Michigan judge has dismissed criminal charges against 15 individuals accused of acting as fake electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Judge Kristen Simmons ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove intent in the fraud case. The dismissal is the latest setback for prosecutors targeting those involved in Trump's efforts to overturn the election results. Similar cases in Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia are facing legal hurdles, while a federal election interference case against Trump was dropped after his reelection. The Michigan Attorney General's office had charged 16 people, with one cooperating to have their charges dropped. The defendants allegedly signed false certificates claiming to be legitimate electors. Some defendants argued they acted in anticipation of Trump's election challenges succeeding. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel criticized the ruling, asserting the defendants knew their actions were fraudulent. The Michigan Republican Party celebrated the dismissal as a victory for justice. Nessel's office is considering an appeal.
