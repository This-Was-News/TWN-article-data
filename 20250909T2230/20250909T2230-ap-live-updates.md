## Article summary
Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily upheld President Donald Trump's decision to freeze nearly $5 billion in foreign aid, suggesting the Supreme Court may reverse a lower court ruling that deemed the freeze likely illegal. The court's order is temporary, but it indicates a potential reversal of the lower court's decision. Trump had previously stated he would not spend the congressionally approved aid, invoking disputed authority not used by a president in roughly 50 years. The Supreme Court has recently sided with Trump on issues like immigration and oversight of the Federal Trade Commission. The Trump administration has significantly reduced foreign aid, despite the relatively modest savings compared to the federal deficit and potential damage to America's reputation abroad. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court granted an expedited hearing on Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs, with arguments set for November. Small businesses and states challenging the tariffs agreed to the accelerated timeline, arguing the tariffs have nearly driven their businesses to bankruptcy. The court's decision comes amid a partial government shutdown looming at the end of the month, with the White House proposing a short-term funding measure through January 31. Congress has yet to approve any spending bills for the 2026 budget year. Additionally, the White House has proposed handwriting experts review Trump's signature on a controversial letter to Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump denies writing. The White House also defended Trump's policies despite benchmark revisions showing a weaker job market than initially reported. The federal budget deficit for the first 11 months of fiscal year 2025 was $2 trillion, $92 billion more than the same period last fiscal year, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report. Income increased by $299 billion, or 7%, over the same period last fiscal year, while spending rose by $391 billion, or 6%. The CBO attributes much of the change in the deficit to the timing of payments from 2024 to 2025. If not for those shifts, the deficit so far this fiscal year would have been $11 billion (or 1 percent) more than the shortfall at this point last year, the CBO says. The CBO currently projects that the deficit for fiscal year 2025 will be $1.8 trillion. White House press secretary Karolyn Leavitt says Trump has no intention of adjusting his tariffs or other policies, despite benchmark revisions showing that he inherited a weaker job market than initially reported. The president is committed to his policies because his policies are working, Leavitt said at the news briefing. The administration maintains that the economy is strong, even though recent jobs data suggest the economy is weakening and inflation is running hotter than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. White House press secretary Karolyn Leavitt says Democrats raising questions about Trump's ties to Jeffrey Epstein are pretending to care about crime victims when they do not care about crime victims, when they have done nothing to solve crimes, when they have done nothing to lock up child pedophiles and child rapists across the country. Leavitt did not say when asked if Trump would meet with the survivors of sex trafficking by Epstein. After Congress released files showing a birthday greeting from Trump to Epstein and a picture of Epstein holding up a novelty check bearing Trump's name, Leavitt said the signatures were fake. The Democrats view this story as nothing more than an attempt to distract from the accomplishments and the achievements of this administration, and that's what we mean when we call it a hoax, Leavitt said. The president will mark the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks by visiting the Pentagon and heading to the Bronx as the New York Yankees host the Detroit Tigers on Thursday. Leavitt said Trump looks very much forward to both, including heading to the Bronx. The president is a New Yorker at heart, Levitt said. He loves the city.
