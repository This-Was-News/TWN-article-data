## Article summary
A preliminary revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicates that job hiring for the year ending in March was overstated by approximately 911,000 jobs, marking the largest such revision on record. This revision suggests that the labor market may be weaker than initially reported. The update is part of a routine annual process to incorporate more comprehensive data. President Trump has been criticizing the BLS, alleging manipulation of data to negatively portray his administration's economic performance. The revision, which covers the period after Trump's brief return to office, has been used by the White House to call for new leadership at the BLS to restore trust in its data. Economists and White House officials had anticipated a significant revision, with estimates ranging from 550,000 to 950,000 jobs. The revision follows recent reports of sluggish job growth and raises concerns about the labor market's health. The Federal Reserve is monitoring these signs ahead of a decision on interest rates, with a rate cut expected to prevent widespread job losses. The White House has also criticized the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, urging rate cuts to stimulate economic growth.
