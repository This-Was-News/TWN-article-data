## Article summary
Charlotte's Democratic Mayor Vi Lyles faces backlash over the stabbing death of a young Ukrainian woman on a commuter train, as she seeks a fifth term. Critics, including Republicans and figures in the Make America Great Again movement, blame Democrats for being soft on crime, citing the killer's extensive criminal record. Lyles, a heavy favorite in the Democratic primary, has been criticized for her response, with some predicting President Donald Trump would use the case to justify taking over law enforcement in Democratic-led cities. Trump has not directly criticized Lyles but has blamed Democrats for the victim's death. The suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., had a long criminal history and was recently charged federally. Lyles has called for addressing root causes of crime, such as homelessness and mental health, but her statement drew criticism. The release of a video of the stabbing intensified the backlash, with figures like Elon Musk and conservative commentators highlighting the case. Trump accused Democrats of releasing offenders too easily, while Lyles' opponents in the mayoral race also criticized her handling of the situation. The incident has impacted other elections, including the U.S. Senate race, where candidates have debated crime policies. Despite the controversy, Lyles remains the front-runner in the Democratic primary, with the winner set to face Republican Terre Donovan in the general election.
