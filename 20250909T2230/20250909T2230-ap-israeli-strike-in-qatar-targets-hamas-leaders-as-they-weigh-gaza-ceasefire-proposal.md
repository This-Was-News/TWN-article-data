## Article summary
Israel struck the Hamas political leadership headquarters in Qatar, targeting top Hamas figures as they considered a U.S. ceasefire proposal. The attack, which killed five lower-level Hamas members and a Qatari security official, escalated tensions and risked derailing peace talks. Qatar condemned the strike as a violation of international law, with Gulf allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates expressing support. The U.S. distanced itself, calling it an unfortunate incident, while Hamas accused Israel and the U.S. of undermining peace efforts. The strike occurred as Israel prepared for a major offensive in Gaza City, facing international condemnation and internal opposition. Hamas, despite suffering losses, remains cohesive. The attack followed recent violence in Jerusalem and Gaza, with both sides trading blame. Mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt have been strained, and the future of ceasefire talks is uncertain. The war has isolated Israel internationally, with calls to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The strike also threatened regional stability, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE expressing solidarity with Qatar.
