## Article summary
The Supreme Court will review whether President Trump lawfully applied emergency powers to impose broad tariffs on various countries, a key part of his economic agenda. Earlier this year, lower courts ruled some of Trump's tariffs illegal, leading to an appeal to the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments in November. The case centers on tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which grants the president economic powers during national emergencies. Trump used IEEPA to impose tariffs on countries like Canada, China, and Mexico, particularly targeting fentanyl trafficking. The case does not affect Trump's Section 232 tariffs on products like steel and aluminum. Two lawsuits challenged the tariffs, with courts ruling that IEEPA does not authorize them, as the power to impose taxes, including tariffs, is vested in Congress. The Supreme Court will decide whether IEEPA authorizes these tariffs and if it unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to the president. The court's decision could uphold, invalidate, or partially validate the tariffs, with implications for future tariff use. Experts suggest Trump could still use other tariff laws, though not as broadly or quickly. The administration has collected billions in tariffs, raising questions about refunds if the tariffs are ruled unlawful. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the government would refund tariff money if ordered by the court.
