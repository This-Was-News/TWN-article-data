## Article summary
A 50th birthday book for Jeffrey Epstein, released by a House committee, includes messages from notable figures. Among them are entries attributed to former U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. Trump's message, which includes a drawing of a curvaceous woman, bears his name and signature, though he denies writing it. Clinton's message praises Epstein's childlike curiosity and is written in cursive on a white sheet of paper. Other contributors include lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who joked about a fictional Vanity Fair article, and various business executives and academics. Some messages are benign, while others are crude or sexually explicit, referencing Epstein's past exploits. The book also includes photos of Epstein and associates, some of whom are minimally clothed. Notable figures like Harvard economist Henry Rosovsky and billionaire Lesle Wexner also contributed messages, some of which include explicit drawings. Attempts to reach some contributors for comment were unsuccessful.
