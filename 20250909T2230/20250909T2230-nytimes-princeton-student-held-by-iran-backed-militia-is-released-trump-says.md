## Article summary
Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Russian-Israeli graduate student at Princeton University, was released from captivity in Iraq after being kidnapped in 2023 by the militant group Kataib Hezbollah. President Trump announced her release, confirming she is now safely at the American Embassy in Iraq. Both Israel and Iraq confirmed her freedom without providing details about the circumstances. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Sha al-Sudani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged her release. Kataib Hezbollah did not immediately comment, and it remains unclear if any exchange occurred for her freedom. Tsurkov, a doctoral candidate, disappeared during a research trip to Baghdad in March 2023. The Israeli government announced her abduction in July 2023. Previous efforts by Israel and U.S. officials to secure her release had been unsuccessful. The Iraqi government had also been searching for her and handling communications with Kataib Hezbollah.
