## Article summary
Home Depot parking lots in Southern California, long used by day laborers for job-seeking, have become targets for immigration raids. Federal agents have conducted multiple raids since June, leading to arrests and creating fear among immigrant workers. Activists and workers use whistles and radios to warn each other about potential raids. The Supreme Court recently allowed these operations to continue, despite lawsuits from immigrant advocates. The raids have caused disruptions, with some workers fleeing and even one fatal incident. Home Depot has denied involvement in these operations but encourages employees to report any immigration enforcement activity. The company's stores have seen a decline in foot traffic due to the raids. Immigrant advocates argue that Home Depot benefits from the labor pool and should do more to protect workers. The trend of workers gathering outside Home Depot began with the rise of the store and has led to complaints and city ordinances. Despite the raids, workers continue to return due to the sense of community and the need for work.
