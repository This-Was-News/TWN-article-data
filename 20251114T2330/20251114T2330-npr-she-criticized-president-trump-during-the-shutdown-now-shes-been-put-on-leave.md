## Article summary
Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has been placed on paid leave following the end of the government shutdown. Norton believes this action is a consequence of her public criticism of the Trump administration's funding cuts and perceived politicization of research at the NIH. She had previously organized scientists to push back against agency changes and expressed concerns about the "destruction of our democracy" due to the administration's actions. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, called Norton a "radical leftist" in response to NPR's inquiries. Another federal employee, Ellen Mei from the Agriculture Department, who spoke critically about food assistance programs on MSNBC, has also been put on leave, facing a proposed termination. Mei stated she was speaking the truth about the impact on hungry families and those serving them. Both Norton and Mei argue that federal workers have a right and an obligation to speak on matters of public concern, citing a 1968 Supreme Court decision that protects public employees' speech on such issues, provided it doesn't disrupt government operations. Norton acknowledges the risk to her job but emphasizes the importance of asserting civil service protections to safeguard the country.
