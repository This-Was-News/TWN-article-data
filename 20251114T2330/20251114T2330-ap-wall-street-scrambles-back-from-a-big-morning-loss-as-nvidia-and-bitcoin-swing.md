## Article summary
The U.S. stock market experienced a significant early morning loss on Friday, with major indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average showing sharp declines. This downturn was heavily influenced by fluctuations in AI-related stocks, particularly Nvidia, which had previously driven market gains. Nvidia, a key player in the artificial intelligence frenzy, started the day down but managed to recover and even climb, pulling the market with it. Concerns about the market being overvalued have been voiced by critics, especially regarding AI stocks, with Nvidia's own performance highlighting this trend. Despite these swings, the S&P 500 remained close to its recent record high. Walmart also saw its stock dip following the announcement of its CEO's upcoming retirement. The market's direction is increasingly tied to Nvidia's performance, especially with its upcoming profit report due next week. Broader market stability can also be influenced by interest rate expectations, with a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in December now uncertain due to persistent inflation and economic data delays from the government shutdown. In other markets, Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, and gold prices also sank. International markets in Europe and Asia also saw declines.
