## Article summary
The White House Historical Association has acquired a series of four Norman Rockwell sketches, titled "So You Want to See the President!", for $5.8 million at auction. These 1940s-era sketches, which depict various individuals waiting to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt, were displayed in the West Wing for years but were removed in 2022 due to a family dispute over ownership. The sketches were sold by a grandson of a White House official who had originally received them as a gift from Rockwell. This purchase marks the highest amount ever paid by the association, surpassing their previous record of $1.5 million for Jacob Lawrence's painting "The Builders". The Rockwell sketches are unique as they are his only known interrelated collection conceived to tell a story, originally published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1943. The association plans to use this acquisition to educate the public about White House history for future generations. They may be displayed at The Peoples House: A White House Experience, an interactive education center opened in September 2024. The White House Historical Association was established in 1961 by Jacqueline Kennedy to preserve the White House's museum quality and educate the public, operating as a non-profit, non-partisan organization without government funding.
