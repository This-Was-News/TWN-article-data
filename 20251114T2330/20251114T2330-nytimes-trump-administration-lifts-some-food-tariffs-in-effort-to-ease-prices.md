## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced the lifting of tariffs on several imported food products, including beef, tomatoes, bananas, and coffee, in an effort to reduce consumer prices. This move comes as a response to rising inflation, which has impacted consumer affordability and potentially affected the administration's approval ratings. While the White House cited progress in trade negotiations and the signing of several trade deals as reasons for the exemptions, critics suggest it's an implicit acknowledgment that tariffs initially raised prices. The exemptions are broader than initially anticipated, applying to various countries and including some goods produced domestically, such as bread and orange juice. Economists generally agree that tariffs increase prices, a concept the administration has often downplayed. Specific products like beef and coffee have seen significant price hikes this year, partly due to tariffs on major exporting countries. The administration's previous stance was that tariffs would boost U.S. investment and production, but many economists argue they lead to higher costs and slower economic growth. The impact of tariffs on goods prices has become more pronounced recently, with consumers bearing more of the cost. This policy shift may alienate some domestic producers who support tariffs and align with the 'America First' philosophy. Industries like spirits, which rely on imports that cannot be produced in the U.S., also expressed disappointment at not being included in the exemptions.
