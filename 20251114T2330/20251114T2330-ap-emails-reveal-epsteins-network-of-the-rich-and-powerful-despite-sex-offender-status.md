## Article summary
Newly released emails from the House Oversight Committee reveal that Jeffrey Epstein maintained extensive connections with influential figures across business, politics, and academia, even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The documents, spanning from 2009 to 2019, illustrate the continued engagement of these individuals with Epstein. His network included figures like Steve Bannon, whom Epstein advised on political strategy in Europe, and former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler. The emails also show Epstein's interactions with Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel and Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, discussing meetings and political figures like Donald Trump. Furthermore, Epstein corresponded with academics such as Laurence Krauss, offering advice on responding to sexual harassment allegations, and linguist Noam Chomsky, with whom he discussed academic topics and offered the use of his residences. The emails also detail exchanges with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who expressed regret over his association with Epstein. These documents shed light on Epstein's persistent influence and the willingness of his associates to remain connected despite his status as a registered sex offender and his eventual arrest on federal sex trafficking charges, to which he died by suicide in jail.
