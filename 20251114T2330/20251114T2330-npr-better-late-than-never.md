## Article summary
A crucial report detailing the September job market is slated for release next Thursday, nearly seven weeks after its original due date. The delay was caused by the government shutdown, which furloughed the economists responsible for compiling the data. Fortunately, the September report was nearly complete when the shutdown occurred, making its eventual publication relatively straightforward. However, the status of other key economic indicators, such as reports on October job gains, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP, remains uncertain. These reports require ongoing data collection, including surveys and price checks, which were also disrupted. The government is working to establish and communicate updated release schedules for these overdue reports. In the meantime, businesses, investors, and policymakers are seeking alternative sources of information to gauge the health of the U.S. economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has posted a notice on its website acknowledging the delays and thanking the public for their understanding.
