## Article summary
The U.S. government has reopened, but the delays in releasing crucial economic data are far from over. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the September jobs report, but fresh data on inflation, spending, and home-building will be significantly delayed. When the data does emerge, it may be based on incomplete information, adding uncertainty. This lack of timely and reliable economic indicators poses a significant challenge for the Federal Reserve's interest rate deliberations, as policymakers will lack essential data for their upcoming meetings. Financial markets are already showing nervousness due to the potential for the Fed to delay expected interest rate cuts. Beyond policymakers, state and local leaders, corporate executives, and investors also rely on this data for critical decision-making. Concerns exist that the shutdown may have caused long-term damage to the statistical system, which was already strained by budget cuts and staff turnover. Some data, like the October Consumer Price Index, may never be accurately produced due to the impossibility of collecting price data retroactively. Similarly, the October household survey for unemployment data might be skipped, breaking a 77-year streak and potentially affecting future economic measures. Clearing the backlog of missed data and resuming normal operations is expected to take months, with lasting repercussions on economic understanding yet to be fully determined.
