## Article summary
The Trump administration is implementing a significant overhaul of its homelessness policy, shifting funding away from long-term housing towards transitional housing programs that mandate work and addiction treatment. This new approach, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, aims to promote "self-sufficiency" by addressing the "root causes of homelessness." While the administration states that overall homelessness funding is increasing, critics express grave concerns that these changes could jeopardize housing for an estimated 170,000 people. They argue that the timing of the funding notices leaves programs with insufficient time to adapt, potentially creating gaps in support. A key change involves HUD no longer automatically renewing existing programs, which could displace individuals who have found stability in permanent housing. Advocacy groups warn that this move away from the long-standing "Housing First" policy, which prioritizes permanent housing, will likely increase homelessness. Critics of "Housing First" argue it has failed to curb rising homelessness and has not adequately addressed issues like addiction. The new policy may also favor locations that enforce bans on homeless encampments. Experts like Stephen Eide from the Manhattan Institute support a reinvestment in transitional housing for sobriety and recovery, while others, such as Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, fear the new policies move away from trauma-informed care and could create barriers to accessing help for many.
