## Article summary
Thirty of Bob Ross's paintings, many created live on his PBS show "The Joy of Painting," are being auctioned to support public television. The first three paintings sold in Los Angeles for a record-breaking $662,000, with "Winter's Peace" fetching $318,000. These sales aim to raise funds for public broadcasters facing federal funding cuts. Bob Ross Inc. believes Ross would have supported this initiative, emphasizing his positive nature. The auction is the largest offering of his original works ever brought to market. Additional paintings will be auctioned in various cities throughout 2026. Ross's show, which aired from 1983 to 1994, continues to be popular, and his wet-on-wet oil painting technique is still taught. The Smithsonian also acquired some of his works in 2019. Proceeds from the auction will help stations cover licensing fees for programs like "The Best of the Joy of Painting," "America's Test Kitchen," and "Rick Steve's Europe." Bonhams estimates the 30 paintings could sell for a total of $850,000 to $1.4 million.
