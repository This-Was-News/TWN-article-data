## Article summary
Eviction can significantly disrupt children's education, even with federal laws designed to help homeless and evicted students remain in their schools. However, families are often unaware of these provisions, and schools do not always share the necessary information. Beyond the instability of losing a home, relocation can also strip children of crucial support networks. The AP followed Sechita McNair's year-long struggle after an eviction in Atlanta. She worked extra hours and borrowed money to find housing in a neighborhood that would allow her son to stay at his high school, despite facing a high rent and a recent eviction on her record. Even with this effort, her son struggled academically. Evicted families frequently move to school districts with fewer resources; Atlanta spends significantly more per student than the suburban district McNair's family moved to. While federal laws allowed McNair's children to attend their Atlanta schools with provided transportation, she was not informed of this until the school year ended. The suburban neighborhood they moved to was described by McNair as a 'support desert,' lacking the community resources available in the city. Finding safe and affordable housing after an eviction proved extremely difficult, with McNair facing challenges even after securing an apartment. The need for parental supervision and consistency is vital for a teenager's learning, especially after experiencing trauma and housing instability. McNair's son, Elias, struggled academically and with attendance, leading her to consider homeschooling, which also presented its own difficulties. Ultimately, keeping Elias in his familiar school environment was deemed crucial for his academic recovery.
