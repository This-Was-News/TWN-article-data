## Article summary
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on Sunday that he has divested his holdings in thousands of acres of North Dakota soybean farmland, fulfilling his federal ethics agreement. This divestment separates him from properties that presented potential conflicts of interest, particularly concerning his role in President Trump's trade negotiations with China, which include Beijing's commitment to purchasing American soybeans. The sale occurred nearly eight months after the initially agreed-upon deadline, drawing criticism from ethics watchdogs due to the delay. Bessent stated he has "just divested it this week as part of my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business." The U.S. government's ethics watchdog had alerted Congress in August that Bessent was not in compliance, with Treasury officials citing the illiquid nature of the assets as the reason for the delay. Financial disclosure forms indicated Bessent owned farmland valued up to $25 million, generating significant rental income. The farmland was managed through a partnership where his husband was a managing partner, and no changes in management had been officially filed. The specifics of the divestment remain unclear, and neither the Treasury Department nor the Office of Government Ethics immediately commented. Agriculture policy has been a critical component of U.S.-China trade discussions, with China having previously reduced soybean purchases in response to U.S. tariffs. A recent trade agreement includes China's commitment to substantial soybean purchases from the U.S. over the next few years. Bessent, a former hedge fund manager, emphasized his understanding of farmers' needs, stating that certainty has been provided through the trade deal.
