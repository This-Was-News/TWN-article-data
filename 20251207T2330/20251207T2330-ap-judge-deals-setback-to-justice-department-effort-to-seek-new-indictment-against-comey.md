## Article summary
A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Justice Department from using certain evidence in its efforts to seek a new indictment against former FBI Director James Comey. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued a ruling that suggests prosecutors may have to proceed without citing communications between Comey and Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman. Comey was initially charged in September with lying to Congress, with prosecutors citing messages between him and Richman as evidence that Comey approved of Richman interacting with journalists. This case was previously dismissed because the prosecutor who filed the charges was unlawfully appointed. However, the dismissal left open the possibility of renewed charges. Lawyers for Richman sought a court order to prevent prosecutors from accessing his computer files, arguing that the Justice Department exceeded the scope of search warrants and illegally retained communications. Judge Kollar-Kotelly granted Richman's request for a temporary restraining order, prohibiting the Justice Department from accessing or disclosing the disputed materials without court permission. The order remains in effect until Friday or further notice. Richman's legal team argued that the continued retention of his computer data violates his Fourth Amendment rights. The Justice Department has declined to comment on the ruling. It remains unclear if new charges can be filed, as Comey's lawyers contend the statute of limitations has expired. Separately, a similar attempt by the Justice Department to indict New York Letitia James, another perceived Trump adversary, also failed when a grand jury refused to approve charges.
