## Article summary
The Trump administration has revised the National Park Service's fee-free calendar, removing Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth while adding President Trump's birthday. These changes, effective January 1, also include the 110th anniversary of the NPS, Constitution Day, and President Teddy Roosevelt's birthday. Non-U.S. residents will still be charged entrance fees on these dates under the new "America-first pricing" policy, which also increases fees for international visitors at popular parks and raises the annual pass cost for non-residents. This initiative aligns with a previous executive order aimed at increasing fees for international visitors and providing preferential treatment to citizens and residents. The Department of the Interior has termed these new dates "patriotic fee-free days," emphasizing a commitment to making parks more accessible and affordable for Americans. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum stated that these policies ensure U.S. taxpayers continue to enjoy affordable access while international visitors contribute to park maintenance. This move is part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration reshaping the narrative of U.S. history on federal lands.
