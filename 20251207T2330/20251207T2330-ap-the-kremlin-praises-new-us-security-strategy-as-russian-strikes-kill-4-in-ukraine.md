## Article summary
Russia has welcomed the new US national security strategy, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stating it aligns with Moscow's vision and expresses a desire for dialogue. This comes as Russian attacks, including missile, drone, and shelling strikes, killed at least four people in Ukraine over the weekend. Attacks targeted the Chernihiv region and the industrial city of Kremenchuk, causing power and water outages, which Ukraine views as an attempt to cripple its power grid during winter. In the Kharkiv region, shelling resulted in three deaths and ten injuries. These incidents occurred as US and Ukrainian officials concluded talks aimed at ending the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed determination to work towards peace and received an update on the negotiations. Outgoing US envoy Keith Kellogg indicated that efforts to end the war were nearing completion, with key issues being terrain, particularly the Donbas, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Leaders from the UK, France, and Germany are scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in London.
