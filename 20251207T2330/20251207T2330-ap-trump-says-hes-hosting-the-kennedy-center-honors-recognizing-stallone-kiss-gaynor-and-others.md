## Article summary
Donald Trump is hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, an event recognizing Sylvester Stallone, Kiss, Gloria Gaynor, George Strait, and Michael Crawford for their contributions to American culture and the arts. This marks the first time a president has hosted the ceremony, rather than attending as a spectator. Trump stated he agreed to host at the request of a television network and predicted record-breaking ratings for the broadcast on CBS and Paramount+. The honors, established in 1978, celebrate influential figures across various art forms. This year's ceremony is expected to be emotional for the band Kiss, as original guitarist Ace Frehley passed away in October. Stallone described the experience as being in the eye of a hurricane, while Crawford and Gaynor expressed humility and disbelief, respectively. Trump has previously been critical of the Kennedy Center's programming and leadership, even suggesting renaming it. Despite past controversies and honorees' potential political disagreements with the president, Trump has indicated involvement in selecting honorees, rejecting some for being "too woke." The political leanings of this year's honorees vary, with some having made political donations or expressed differing views on Trump's actions.
