President Trump criticized Representative Henry Cuellar for not switching to the Republican party after receiving a pardon. Cuellar, a Democrat, defended himself as a conservative who works with both parties and suggested his indictment was politically motivated. Meanwhile, Democrats are calling for the release of classified video footage of a military operation in the Caribbean that resulted in the deaths of two survivors.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has expressed hesitancy to release the video due to concerns about compromising sources and methods. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged an affordability problem but blamed Biden administration policies, predicting inflation will decrease. The Trump administration announced it would waive an $11 million fine against Southwest Airlines related to its 2022 holiday travel disruptions, a move criticized as company-friendly.
