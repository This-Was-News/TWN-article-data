## Article summary
Bellingham, Washington, a community that welcomed Afghan refugees starting in 2021, is now grappling with fear and sorrow following a violent attack in Washington, D.C., allegedly carried out by a local Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal. The attack, which resulted in the death of one National Guard member and serious injury to another, has sent shockwaves through Bellingham's small Afghan refugee community. Volunteers and immigration attorneys report that Afghan families are experiencing "overwhelming fear," worried about their safety, their legal status, and potential repercussions from the FBI investigation and a subsequent freeze on Afghan asylum claims by the Trump administration. Some in Bellingham who worked with Lakanwal noted signs of deteriorating mental health as early as January 2024, but struggled to find resources to help him. The community faces challenges including poverty, language barriers, and cultural isolation, and many are now hesitant to seek social services for fear of jeopardizing their asylum cases. Activists and volunteers are scrambling to provide support amidst deepening uncertainty about the refugees' future in the U.S., with concerns that deportation could lead to persecution by the Taliban. Despite the alleged actions of one individual, many Bellingham residents emphasize that the Afghan community is not violent and is a valued part of their town, expressing concern that the government's reaction is an overly broad response to a single incident.
