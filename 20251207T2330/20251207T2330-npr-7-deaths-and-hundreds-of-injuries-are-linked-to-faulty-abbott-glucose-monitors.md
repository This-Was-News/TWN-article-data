## Article summary
Abbott Diabetes Care has issued a warning regarding faulty glucose readings from some of its FreeStyle Libre 3 and FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus sensors. These devices, with approximately 3 million affected units, may provide incorrect low glucose readings. Internal testing identified a single production line as the source of the issue. Abbott advises customers to immediately discontinue use and dispose of affected sensors if their device is confirmed to be impacted. Prolonged undetected incorrect low glucose readings can lead to serious health risks, including potential injury or death, due to incorrect treatment decisions such as excessive carbohydrate intake or delayed insulin doses. Seven deaths outside the U.S. and 736 severe injuries, with 57 occurring in the U.S., have been linked to these faulty readings. Abbott is replacing faulty sensors at no charge and directs customers to FreeStyleCheck.com to determine their device's status. The company does not anticipate significant supply disruptions from this issue.
