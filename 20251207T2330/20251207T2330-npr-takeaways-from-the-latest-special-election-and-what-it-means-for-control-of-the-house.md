## Article summary
Recent special elections indicate a potential wave of Democratic support that could shift control of the House of Representatives. Republicans won a special congressional election in Tennessee, but by a significantly smaller margin than in the previous year, mirroring a trend of Democratic overperformance in other recent elections. On average, Democrats have seen a 14-point improvement compared to 2024 results. The Supreme Court has provided a boost to Republicans by allowing a new congressional map in Texas to proceed, despite claims of racial gerrymandering. This redrawn map aims to secure the GOP's narrow House majority, though Democrats are working to counter these gains through redistricting efforts in other states. However, potential shifts in Latino voter support away from former President Trump, due to concerns about the economy and immigration policies, could impact Republican prospects. Public views on the economy are currently grim, with a significant majority believing it is worsening, reaching a 17-month low in economic confidence. This negative economic sentiment is further compounded by dissatisfaction with Trump's handling of the economy, with many Americans, including some of his own voters, feeling the cost of living is at its worst. Trump's dismissal of affordability concerns as a "con job" by Democrats contrasts with the lived experiences of voters facing rising prices for essentials like groceries and healthcare. The economic tide appears to be against Republicans, contributing to a notable number of GOP members choosing not to seek reelection.
