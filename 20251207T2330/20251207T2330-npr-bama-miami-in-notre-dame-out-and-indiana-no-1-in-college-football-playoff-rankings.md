## Article summary
Indiana has surprisingly secured the No. 1 spot in the 12-team College Football Playoff rankings, a move that has generated significant attention. The selection committee's decisions have led to considerable debate, particularly the exclusion of Notre Dame. Despite a strong winning streak, Notre Dame was passed over for Alabama and Miami, who secured the final bubble spots. Alabama remained in the rankings despite a loss to Georgia, adhering to a policy that doesn't penalize teams for playing in their conference championship game. Miami's inclusion was influenced by their earlier win over Notre Dame, a game the committee re-evaluated. Another contentious decision was selecting James Madison over Duke for the final playoff spot, leaving the ACC champion out of the bracket. The rest of the top teams include Ohio State, Georgia, and Texas Tech, all receiving first-round byes. The playoff field also features Oregon, Ole Miss, Texas A&M, Oklahoma, Alabama, Miami, Tulane, and James Madison. The first-round games are scheduled for December 19-20, with the championship game set for January 19.
