## Article summary
The College Football Playoff (CFP) bracket has been revealed, with Indiana securing the No. 1 seed. The bracket features a 12-team field, including notable inclusions like Miami and Alabama. Three of the participating teams are currently undergoing head coach transitions, with new coaches taking over at UCLA, Florida, and LSU. The AP Top 25 poll and the CFP rankings show some discrepancies, particularly regarding Alabama's placement and the exclusion of Notre Dame. The Southeastern Conference leads with five teams in the CFP bracket. The first round of the playoff includes two rematches: Oklahoma against Alabama, and Tulane against Ole Miss. James Madison's historic inclusion in the CFP marks a significant achievement for the program. The debate continues regarding the potential expansion of the CFP to a 16-team format. The Big 12 Conference has fined Iowa State and Kansas State $500,000 each for opting out of bowl games due to coaching changes and player concerns. The final AP Top 25 poll ranked Indiana first, followed by Georgia, Ohio State, and Texas Tech, with significant debate surrounding Alabama's exclusion from the top spots in favor of Notre Dame and Miami.
