## Article summary
This article tells the story of Ruty Pereira and other mothers in Brazil whose children were affected by the Zika virus, leading to conditions like microcephaly. These mothers, initially feeling voiceless, transformed into activists, demanding reparations from the Brazilian government for its failure to protect them from the disease. The struggle involved immense personal hardship, including demanding care for their children and navigating financial difficulties, which led Pereira to leave her marriage. They found strength and support in each other, forming a community association called Família de Anjos. Their activism culminated in a protest that helped them secure public housing, improving their quality of life and dignity. A major victory was achieved when the Brazilian Congress passed a reparations bill, providing financial compensation to the affected children, acknowledging the government's past neglect. This law signifies a recognition of their struggle and offers a path towards a better future for these families.
