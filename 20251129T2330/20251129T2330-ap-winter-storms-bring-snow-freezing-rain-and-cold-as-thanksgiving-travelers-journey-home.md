## Article summary
A major snowstorm swept across the Midwest and Great Lakes regions, impacting Thanksgiving travelers with significant snowfall, freezing rain, and cold temperatures. Winter storm warnings and advisories were in effect from Montana to Ohio, with forecasts predicting heavy snow accumulation, potentially exceeding 8 inches in some areas. This led to airport delays in cities like Chicago and St. Louis, as well as hazardous driving conditions on roadways. Incidents such as a multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 70 in Indiana highlighted the dangers, prompting authorities to urge residents to stay home. The storm also brought snowy conditions to college football games in Michigan and Illinois. While blizzard conditions were not met, the storm system was expected to bring thunderstorms and heavy rain to the South. Looking ahead, another winter storm was anticipated for the Northeast early in the week, bringing the possibility of freezing rain and ice to the Appalachians and snow to interior northeastern states.
