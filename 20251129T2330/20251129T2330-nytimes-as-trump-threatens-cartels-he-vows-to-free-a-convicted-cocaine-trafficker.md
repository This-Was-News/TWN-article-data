## Article summary
President Trump's recent actions reveal a stark contradiction in his strategy against drug trafficking. While announcing a pardon for former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in the U.S., Trump simultaneously threatened to close airspace over Venezuela as part of his campaign against drug cartels. Prosecutors had stated that Hernández, while president, accepted bribes from cartels and facilitated the flow of cocaine from Venezuela to the U.S. This pardon has been criticized as unconscionable and undermining the administration's claims of combating illicit drug trade. The administration has also amassed a significant military presence in the Caribbean, ostensibly for counternarcotics operations, though private interests in Venezuela's oil reserves have also been cited. Trump stated the pardon was at the request of friends, suggesting any president could be subject to such actions. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly asserted Trump has done more than anyone to combat drug deaths by securing the border and targeting narco-terrorists. Top advisor Stephen Miller characterized Venezuela as a narcoterrorist ring. The U.S. military has conducted numerous strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean, resulting in casualties, though evidence for these claims remains largely undisclosed. Critics argue the policy of pardoning convicted traffickers while targeting unknown individuals at sea is nonsensical and illegal. Trump has also pressured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of leading a drug organization, though experts question its existence. The pardon of Hernández, who faced a 45-year sentence, shocked officials and highlighted potential political motivations, especially given the involvement of one of Trump's former lawyers in the prosecution.
