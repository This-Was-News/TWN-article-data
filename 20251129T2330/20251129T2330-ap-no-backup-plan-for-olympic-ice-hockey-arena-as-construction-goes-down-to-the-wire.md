## Article summary
The main ice hockey arena for the Milan Cortina Winter Games, the Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, is facing significant construction delays, with no backup plan in place if it's not ready on time. A test event had to be relocated, and new test events are not scheduled until January, leaving little room for error before the Olympic competitions begin. The first women's preliminary round game is scheduled for February 5th, just one day before the opening ceremony. Typically, new Olympic venues undergo testing at least a year in advance. Andrea Francisi, chief games operations officer, stated there is no Plan B and expressed confidence that the arena will be ready, highlighting daily monitoring and increased work speed from construction companies. He acknowledged there's no precise handover date but remains "healthily optimistic" about completing the venue for the Olympics. The men's tournament is set for February 11-22, and the women's tournament runs from February 5-19.
