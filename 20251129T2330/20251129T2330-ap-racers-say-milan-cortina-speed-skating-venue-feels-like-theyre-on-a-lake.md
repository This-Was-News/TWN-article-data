## Article summary
The temporary speed skating venue for the Milan Cortina Olympics has been described by racers as feeling like skating on a lake due to its unique sound and ice conditions. During a Junior World Cup test event, athletes noted that the track's construction, with the ice layer about 20 centimeters above the concrete, creates a hollow sound and occasional cracks, reminiscent of natural ice. Canadian ice master Mark Messer is overseeing the ice production and is working with skaters and coaches to refine the ice quality, aiming for faster speeds while maintaining safety. This temporary structure, located in Milan's Fiera Milano exhibition venue, is the first of its kind for Olympic long track speed skating. The sensation of skating on a lake is attributed to insulation beneath the concrete, creating a perceived void. The venue's location was a subject of controversy, with initial plans for an outdoor track in Baselga di Piné being rejected by the IOC due to cost concerns. Alternative proposals, including using the 2006 Turin Olympic venue or the Arena Civica in Milan, were also dismissed for various reasons, including cost and preference for controlled indoor environments.
