## Article summary
National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, both from West Virginia, were shot in Washington D.C. while on duty. Beckstrom has passed away, while Wolfe remains in critical condition. The suspect, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who immigrated to the U.S. in 2021, has been charged with first-degree murder. Lakanwal previously worked with an elite CIA-operated counterterrorism unit in Afghanistan. Officials are investigating the motive behind the shooting, with no definitive reason yet established. In response to the incident and broader immigration concerns, the Trump administration has announced a permanent pause on migration from all "Third World Countries." U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has also halted all asylum decisions to ensure thorough vetting and screening of all individuals entering the country. Governor Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia has called for a moment of silence to honor the fallen service members, emphasizing their sacrifice and dedication.
