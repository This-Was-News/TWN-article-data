## Article summary
The Winter Olympians participating in the Milan Cortina Games will be housed in a temporary Athletes Village in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, consisting of 377 rented mobile homes. This village, designed for simplicity and environmental consideration, will accommodate up to 1,400 athletes and team members. The accommodations are described as spartan, with each mobile home divided into two rooms, each featuring a private bathroom and shower. While lacking luxury, the village offers close proximity to the Dolomites, providing a quiet environment for athletes. Organizers emphasize that the village is temporary, with plans for all structures to be removed post-Games, and the land to be restored and improved. This approach contrasts with the more permanent facilities often associated with the Olympics. Despite some nations, like Norway, opting for hotel accommodations, many others, including the host Italy, the U.S., and Germany, will utilize the village. The Cortina Village will host events including women's Alpine skiing, curling, bobsled, luge, and skeleton, and will also be crucial for the Paralympics. Each room is equipped with individual heating controls, with thermostats and infrared panels to maintain comfortable temperatures. After the Games, the mobile homes will be repurposed for use at camping sites across Italy. The project, costing 38 million euros, has involved some tree removal, but organizers state new plants and trees have been introduced to preserve the natural park environment.
