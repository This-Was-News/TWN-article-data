## Article summary
Honduran President Xiomara Castro's administration initially opposed President Trump's deportation plans but later agreed to accept deportation flights, making Honduras a hub for deportations to other Latin American countries. This shift occurred despite the hopes of Hondurans like Delmar Méndez and Doris Palada, who had sought asylum in the U.S. and expected Castro to advocate for migrants. The upcoming Honduran presidential election has become entangled with U.S. politics, as Trump has endorsed a conservative candidate and pledged to pardon a former Honduran president convicted of drug trafficking. This situation reflects a broader challenge for Latin American leaders, who must navigate the potential repercussions from Trump, who has threatened penalties for non-cooperation with his policies. The cooperation on deportations highlights the complex relationship between the U.S. and its southern neighbors, particularly in the context of migration and political influence.
