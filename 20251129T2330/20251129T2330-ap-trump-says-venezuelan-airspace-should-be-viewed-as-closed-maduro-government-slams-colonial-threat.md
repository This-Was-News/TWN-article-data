## Article summary
President Donald Trump stated that Venezuela's airspace should be considered entirely closed, a declaration that has prompted strong criticism from the Venezuelan government, which labeled it a "colonial threat" aimed at undermining the nation's sovereignty. The White House has not clarified whether this statement represents a new policy or reinforces existing pressure tactics against Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. This announcement follows a series of U.S. military actions, including strikes against vessels suspected of drug trafficking and a significant naval buildup in the region. Venezuela's Foreign Ministry forcefully rejected Trump's claim, deeming it a hostile and arbitrary act. International airlines have already begun canceling flights to Venezuela due to FAA advisories regarding heightened military activity. The U.S. government does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader and has imposed sanctions and charges of narcoterrorism. The U.S. military presence, including the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, represents a substantial increase in American firepower in the region. Concerns have been raised regarding the U.S. military's operational conduct, with calls for oversight into recent strikes against suspected drug smugglers. Trump's administration has explored various options to pressure Maduro, including military and covert actions, and there are reports of direct communication between Trump and Maduro, though the White House has declined to comment.
