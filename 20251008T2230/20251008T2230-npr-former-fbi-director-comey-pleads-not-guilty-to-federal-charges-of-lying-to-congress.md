## Article summary
Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. Comey's lawyer entered the plea during his arraignment in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, with a trial date set for January 5, 2026. The charges stem from Comey's 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The indictment came shortly after President Trump urged prosecutors to expedite their investigation against Comey. The top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia initially doubted the evidence's strength but was replaced by Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide and Trump's former personal attorney, who secured the indictment. Comey's legal team plans to file motions to dismiss the case, alleging vindictive prosecution and Halligan's unlawful appointment. They may also raise issues with the grand jury process. Trump has been a vocal critic of Comey, blaming him for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Trump's campaign contacts with Russia.
