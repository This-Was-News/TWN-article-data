## Article summary
The government shutdown has entered its second week with no resolution in sight. Senate Republicans need eight Democratic senators to cross party lines to pass a stopgap spending bill, but so far, none have budged. Democrats are insisting on negotiations to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies before reopening the government. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Gary Peters, who are not seeking re-election, are seen as potential swing votes due to their history of bipartisanship. Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia faces a political dilemma as his constituents are affected by the shutdown, but crossing party lines could alienate his base. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, both up for re-election, are also key targets but have not shown willingness to compromise. Moderate Democrats from competitive states, such as Senators Jacky Rosen, Maggie Hassan, and Elissa Slotkin, are also being watched closely. Senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego of Arizona have expressed willingness to negotiate but want concrete actions from Republicans. The impasse highlights the deep divisions between the parties and the challenges of finding a bipartisan solution.
