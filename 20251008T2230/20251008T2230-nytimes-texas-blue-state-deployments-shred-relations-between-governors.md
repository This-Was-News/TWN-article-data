## Article summary
The deployment of Texas National Guard troops to Illinois by President Trump has caused a rift among governors, breaking the bipartisan image they have long maintained. Democratic governors, including JB Pritzker of Illinois and Gavin Newsom of California, have threatened to leave the National Governors Association, accusing Republican governors, particularly Greg Abbott of Texas, of betrayal. Abbott has retaliated by calling Pritzker clueless and accusing him of being weak on crime and illegal immigration. The dispute has strained the National Governors Association, which has historically sought bipartisan agreement. Former governors have filed a legal brief opposing the Texas Guard mobilization, citing concerns about the balance of state and federal authority. The conflict has also highlighted the political ambitions of the governors involved, with the 2028 presidential election looming. Despite efforts to model productive debate, the public feud between Abbott and Pritzker has intensified political tensions. The National Governors Association has remained silent on the issue, with its current chairman, Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, suggesting the association's role is to find areas of agreement rather than make statements. The dispute has underscored the growing polarization and partisan conflicts among state leaders.
