## Article summary
The Senate voted on legislation to limit President Trump's authority to use military force against drug cartels in the Caribbean. The resolution aimed to require congressional approval for future strikes, following the administration's destruction of four vessels and killing of 21 people. The White House asserted that drug traffickers are armed combatants, justifying military action, but faced criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans. The vote was expected to fail, but it allowed lawmakers to express their objections. Senator Rand Paul was the sole Republican supporting the resolution, while others questioned the administration's justification and lack of information. Democrats argued that the strikes violated U.S. and international law and expressed concerns about the potential for unintended conflict. The administration, supported by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, urged senators to vote against the legislation, emphasizing the threat posed by cartels. The debate highlighted tensions over congressional oversight and the use of military force.
