## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views on food could lead to significant changes in the upcoming federal dietary guidelines. Expected this fall, these guidelines are typically based on scientific research and emphasize fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains while limiting saturated fats, added sugars, and refined carbohydrates. However, Kennedy has expressed strong opinions against the current guidelines, criticizing them as incomprehensible and favoring a simpler, four-page document focused on whole and local foods. Experts warn that such a change could cause chaos, as the guidelines are crucial for federal food aid and other policies. Kennedy's affinity for saturated fats and red meat, as well as his support for full-fat dairy, could lead to controversial shifts in dietary advice. The guidelines have historically advised limiting saturated fats due to their link to heart disease, but recent research suggests that low-carb, higher-fat diets may have some benefits. The new guidelines may also address ultraprocessed foods, which Kennedy has criticized for contributing to chronic diseases. Additionally, the guidelines' stance on alcohol remains uncertain, with conflicting studies on its health impacts. Overall, Kennedy's influence could result in a radical departure from traditional dietary advice, sparking significant debate.
