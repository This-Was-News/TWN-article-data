## Article summary
President Donald Trump has called for the jailing of Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, both Democrats, for opposing his deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. The troops, part of an aggressive immigration enforcement operation, are stationed outside Chicago despite a lawsuit by the state and city to block their deployment. Trump's comments are part of a pattern of calling for opponents to be prosecuted or locked up. Meanwhile, former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty in a criminal case that highlights the Justice Department's efforts to target Trump's adversaries. The government shutdown continues, with no end in sight, and the IRS will furlough nearly half of its workforce. In other news, a federal judge ruled that ICE has repeatedly violated a 2022 consent decree regarding warrantless arrests, and the number of international students arriving in the U.S. on student visas has declined. Additionally, Trump may travel to the Middle East to finalize an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, and the House Speaker has rejected calls for a stand-alone vote on paying military service members during the shutdown.
