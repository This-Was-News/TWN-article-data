## Article summary
President Trump described Portland as a war-ravaged city under siege by Antifa mobs, but federal officers reported the protests as 'low energy' before his intervention. Internal reports from late September showed mostly civil disobedience, with protesters standing in front of vehicles, playing loud music, and writing on walls. Some tense incidents were noted, including confrontations between protesters and counterprotesters, but local officials argued the city could manage the demonstrations without federal troops. City and state leaders reported increased intensity in protests after Trump's social media post, with more arrests and larger crowds. Federal Protective Service reports from Sept. 21 to Sept. 26 did not indicate dangerous escalation or unusual protest activity. A federal judge temporarily blocked the use of the National Guard, citing evidence that protests were not significantly violent or disruptive before Trump's directive. The Portland Police Bureau reported 40 arrests since June, with 13 occurring after Trump's post. Protesters aimed to send a message to the federal government, not storm the ICE building. The reports described protesters as exhibiting low energy, with no behavior prompting law enforcement intervention on the night before Trump's announcement.
