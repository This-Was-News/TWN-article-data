## Article summary
The IRS will furlough nearly half of its workforce as the government shutdown enters its second week. Most IRS operations are closed, and only 39,870 employees, or 53.6%, will remain working. The shutdown has caused delays and backlogs, making it harder for taxpayers to get assistance. The National Treasury Employees Union president warns of increased wait times and delays in implementing tax law changes. Furloughed workers and those remaining on the job will receive back pay once the shutdown ends. President Trump and Congress have not reached an agreement to fund federal operations. The IRS initially used Inflation Reduction Act funds to remain open for the first five business days. The shutdown has affected roughly 750,000 federal workers nationwide, with some potentially facing termination. The IRS has already undergone mass layoffs, reducing its workforce from 100,000 to around 75,000. The Trump administration and Congress are urged to reach an agreement to reopen the government and restore services.
