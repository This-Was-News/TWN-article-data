## Article summary
Gold is experiencing its best year since 1979 due to global economic uncertainties. The price of gold has reached a record high of $4,000 per ounce, with a 50% increase this year alone. Investors are turning to gold as a 'safe haven' amid concerns about the U.S. economy and President Trump's unpredictable policies. Despite record highs in U.S. stock markets, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen by 10%, further driving gold's appeal. Analysts predict gold prices could reach $4,900 by the end of 2026. Gold's reputation as a safe investment during turbulent times is driving its current surge. However, investing in gold comes with challenges, such as storage and security issues, and the lack of dividends or interest. Experts advise diversifying investments to mitigate risks.
