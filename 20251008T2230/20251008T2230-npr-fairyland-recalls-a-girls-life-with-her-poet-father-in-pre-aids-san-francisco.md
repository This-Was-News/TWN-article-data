## Article summary
The memoir *Fairyland* by Alysia Abbott recounts her unconventional childhood in 1970s San Francisco with her widowed, gay father, Steve Abbott, a poet and novelist. The story, which highlights a time of freedom and acceptance before the AIDS epidemic, has been adapted into a film set for release on October 10. Directed by Andrew Durham and produced by Sofia Coppola, the film stars Scoot McNairy as Steve Abbott and Nessa Dougherty as young Alysia. The narrative captures the bohemian lifestyle of the era, filled with creativity, love, and a sense of wonder. Both Abbott and Durham share personal connections to the story, having experienced the loss of their fathers to AIDS in 1992. The film aims to remind audiences of the impact of the AIDS crisis and the resilience of the queer community. Abbott hopes the story will inspire young queer individuals by showcasing the community's history of perseverance and thriving through adversity.
