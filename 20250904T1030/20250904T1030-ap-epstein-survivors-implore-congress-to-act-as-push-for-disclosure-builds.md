## Article summary
Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse urged Congress to release the so-called Epstein files and push back against President Donald Trump's dismissal of the issue as a hoax. At a news conference on Capitol Hill, they shared their experiences of being lured into Epstein's abuse by his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, and demanded transparency and accountability. The push for disclosure comes as lawmakers debate how to investigate the Epstein saga, with Trump initially supporting transparency but later dismissing it. Survivors, including registered Republicans, pleaded for Trump's support. Epstein died in 2019 while awaiting trial, and Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for luring teenage girls for Epstein to abuse. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, usually aligned with Trump, supported a bill to force the Justice Department to release information on Epstein and Maxwell, describing it as a moral fight against sexual predation. House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that a House Oversight Committee investigation was the best way to achieve transparency. The White House warned that supporting the bill would be seen as a hostile act. Survivors saw this moment as their best chance in years to gain justice and demanded a full accounting of everyone involved in Epstein's behavior. They hope lawmakers and federal officials will act to ensure abusers like Epstein are held accountable.
