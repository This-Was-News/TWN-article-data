## Article summary
John Deere, a leading U.S. agricultural machinery manufacturer, is facing significant challenges due to tariffs and struggling farmers. The company reported a 29% drop in net income, with higher metal tariffs costing it $300 million so far and an additional $300 million expected by year-end. Farmers are shifting to used equipment due to rising new tractor prices, which have increased by at least 60% over the past eight years. Crop prices, particularly for corn and soybeans, have plummeted, reducing farmers' purchasing power. John Deere anticipates a 15-20% decline in large agricultural machinery sales in 2025, with the downturn extending into 2026. Tariffs imposed by both the U.S. and China have disrupted soybean exports, further straining farmers' finances. The company's efforts to clear inventory and offer attractive financing have not yet led to a recovery. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, citing potential benefits from recent tax law changes and John Deere's strong position in foreign markets. However, widespread uncertainty about trade policies, interest rates, and crop exports continues to dampen farmers' willingness to invest in expensive new equipment.
