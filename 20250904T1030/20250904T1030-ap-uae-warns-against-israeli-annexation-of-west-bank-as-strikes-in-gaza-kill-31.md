## Article summary
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has warned that any Israeli move to annex the occupied West Bank would be a red line, potentially impacting the Abraham Accords. This warning comes as Israel continues its offensive in Gaza, which has killed at least 31 people. Israeli strikes targeted Gaza City and southern Gaza, including those seeking humanitarian aid. The UAE, a key player in the Abraham Accords, emphasized that annexation would undermine the agreement and regional integration efforts. Meanwhile, Israelis protested the call-up of 60,000 reserves for the expanded operation, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the fighting for political reasons. The conflict has left Israel increasingly isolated and sparked global condemnation. Palestinians in Gaza face severe displacement and starvation, with the Gaza Health Ministry reporting deaths from malnutrition. Israel disputes claims of starvation, despite evidence to the contrary. Additionally, Israeli police arrested the owner of a Palestinian bookshop in Jerusalem, confiscating books and detaining him without a warrant. In another development, Israel's internal security agency arrested a Hamas cell in the West Bank suspected of plotting to assassinate a far-right cabinet minister.
