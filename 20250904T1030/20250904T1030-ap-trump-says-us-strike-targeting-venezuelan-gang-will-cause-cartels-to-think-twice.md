## Article summary
President Donald Trump justified a U.S. military strike against a Venezuelan gang, stating it was necessary to deter Latin American cartels from smuggling drugs into the U.S. He claimed the operation would make drug smugglers think twice. Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported the strike, arguing that previous interdiction efforts had failed. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asserted that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was running a narco-state but did not provide evidence linking the targeted gang, Tren de Aragua, to the drug smuggling. Venezuela questioned the authenticity of a video showing the strike, suggesting it was artificial intelligence-generated. Trump designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, though experts note its limited direct involvement in international drug trade. The strike's legality was questioned by international law experts. The U.S. plans to boost its maritime presence near Venezuela to combat drug cartels, while Maduro's government has responded with military deployments. Analysts suggest the strike signals a shift in U.S. policy towards more aggressive actions in the region.
