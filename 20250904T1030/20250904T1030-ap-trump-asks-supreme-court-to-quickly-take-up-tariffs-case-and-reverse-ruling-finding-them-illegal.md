## Article summary
The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to quickly review and overturn a lower court ruling that deemed most of President Donald Trump's tariffs illegal under an emergency powers law. The administration argues that the president has the authority to impose sweeping import taxes and seeks a swift resolution to avoid disrupting ongoing trade negotiations. The case, which involves tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, has significant implications for small businesses and global trade. The appeals court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to set tariffs without congressional approval. The administration's appeal is part of a broader effort to defend Trump's trade policies, which have generated substantial revenue but also caused market instability and strained international relations. The Supreme Court's decision could impact the administration's ability to use tariffs as a tool in trade negotiations and potentially require refunds of collected import taxes if the tariffs are struck down.
