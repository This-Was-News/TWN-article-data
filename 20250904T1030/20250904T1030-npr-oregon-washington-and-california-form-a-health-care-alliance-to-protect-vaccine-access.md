## Article summary
The Democratic governors of Oregon, Washington, and California have formed the Western Health Alliance to preserve vaccine access amid turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The alliance will develop its own immunization guidelines based on respected national medical organizations. This move follows recent chaos at the CDC, including the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and resignations of top scientists. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his anti-vaccine views, has faced criticism for his leadership. The FDA recently approved new COVID-19 vaccines but limited their availability to high-risk individuals. The alliance aims to ensure clear, science-based communication about vaccines and explore options like bulk purchasing agreements. The states have a history of collaborating on public health initiatives, such as the Western States Pact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tensions between these states and the Trump administration have been rising, particularly over immigration and healthcare policies. The alliance's goal is to expand vaccine access and coverage without out-of-pocket costs, with support from some Pacific Northwest Democrats in the U.S. Senate.
