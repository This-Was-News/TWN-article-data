## Article summary
China, heavily reliant on imported soybeans, has boycotted U.S. soybeans since May 2025 in response to President Trump's tariffs, impacting Midwestern U.S. farmers. China imports three-fifths of globally traded soybeans, with Brazil being the primary supplier. While China has increased domestic soybean production, it still needs to import large quantities. The trade standoff poses risks for both countries, as China may struggle if Brazil faces crop failures. China's soybean imports reflect a shift towards protein-rich diets. Despite efforts to reduce dependency on U.S. soybeans, China has not found a sufficient alternative. The U.S. remains a significant soybean exporter to China, though Beijing has reduced imports of other American goods. China's strategic soybean reserves could potentially be used in this trade dispute, but the extent of this reserve is uncertain.
