## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services Secretary, will testify before the Senate Finance Committee. The hearing follows his controversial actions at the CDC, including the removal of Director Susan Monarez and the resignation of three top CDC officials. Kennedy's testimony will address the 2026 health care agenda and his 'Make America Healthy Again' goal, but questions will focus on CDC leadership, vaccine policy changes, and calls for his resignation. Kennedy, known for his anti-vaccine advocacy, previously assured senators he would not discourage vaccinations. However, he has since overhauled federal vaccine policies, replacing key advisory panel members with anti-vaccine activists. Changes to vaccine recommendations could significantly impact public health and insurance coverage. Kennedy defends his actions, citing the need to restore trust in the CDC. The agency has seen a mass exodus of staff, partly driven by Kennedy's reforms. Meanwhile, Kennedy is promoting state efforts to limit food additives and ultra-processed products, aiming to improve public health.
