## Article summary
Fox News executives privately criticized U.S. Attorney Jeanne Pirro, calling her a 'reckless maniac' and expressing concerns about her responsibility and tendency to promote conspiracy theories. Pirro, a former Fox News star, was appointed by President Trump as the U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., and has since led high-profile crime crackdowns. However, her prosecutorial efforts have faced pushback from judges and grand juries. Legal documents from a defamation lawsuit against Fox News reveal that executives privately agreed Trump lost the 2020 election but publicly amplified his baseless claims, with Pirro being a prominent voice. Fox argues that it was reporting on newsworthy claims and should not be held liable for defamation. Pirro's past actions at Fox, including promoting unfounded election fraud allegations, have drawn criticism from both Fox executives and legal authorities.
