## Article summary
President Trump's administration has requested the Supreme Court to expedite a decision on his sweeping tariffs, which a federal appeals court recently invalidated. The appeals court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority by using a 1977 emergency law to impose tariffs on major trading partners. The court temporarily paused its ruling, allowing the tariffs to remain in effect until October 14, giving Trump time to appeal to the Supreme Court. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to decide by September 10 whether to review the case and schedule oral arguments for November. If accepted, this case would be the first in Trump's second term to directly test the legality of one of his administration's signature initiatives. Trump has relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to force companies to invest in the U.S. The administration warns of severe economic, military, and diplomatic consequences if the tariffs are overturned. The solicitor general argued that the lower court's decision disrupted ongoing trade negotiations and created legal uncertainty. The petition for expedited review was confirmed by both sides in the litigation, though it had not been publicly docketed late Wednesday.
