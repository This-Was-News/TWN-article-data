## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Education under the Trump administration is using civil rights laws to challenge school policies, particularly those supporting transgender students and programs aimed at helping students of color. In April, they investigated Chicago Public Schools for a program allegedly discriminating against non-Black students. In July, they ruled against five Virginia school districts for allowing transgender students to use facilities based on gender identity. Recently, they warned Denver Public Schools to adopt biology-based definitions for 'male' and 'female' or risk losing federal funding. The administration argues they are enforcing civil rights laws as intended, while Democrats criticize these moves as misinterpretations of the law. The battles over Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination, have intensified, with the Trump administration reversing Obama-era protections for transgender students. The administration has also targeted higher education institutions, including Harvard and Brown, for alleged discrimination and antisemitism. The Education Department has closed several regional offices, raising concerns about its ability to handle other civil rights cases, such as sexual assault complaints. The administration's actions have put significant federal funding at risk for schools and states that resist their policies.
