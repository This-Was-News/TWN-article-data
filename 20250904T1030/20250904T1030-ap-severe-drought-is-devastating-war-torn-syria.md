## Article summary
Syria is facing its worst drought in decades, severely impacting agriculture and food security. The drought has shriveled crops, dried up rivers and lakes, and led to prolonged water shortages in major cities. Small farmers like Mansour Mahmoud al-Khatb have seen their yields drastically reduced, with this year's harvest producing only a quarter of what a good year would. The prolonged war has left farmers financially strained, making it difficult to cope with the drought's effects. Syria's wheat production has plummeted from pre-war levels of 3.5 to 4.5 million tons annually to just 1 million tons this year, forcing the country to rely heavily on imports. The drought is exacerbated by climate change, which has reduced rainfall and water flow into critical reservoirs like Lake Qaraoun in neighboring Lebanon. The Orontes River, a vital water source in Syria's Idlib province, has dried up, leaving farmers without irrigation and causing significant crop losses. Experts warn that Syria is ill-prepared for worsening climate shocks, with groundwater levels dropping rapidly due to over-pumping. While measures like rainwater harvesting and drought-resistant crops could help mitigate some impacts, the long-term viability of Syria's croplands remains uncertain. The country's postwar reconstruction and ongoing sectarian violence further complicate efforts to address the drought and its consequences.
