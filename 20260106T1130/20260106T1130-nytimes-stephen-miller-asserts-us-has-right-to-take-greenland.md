## Article summary
Stephen Miller, a senior aide to President Trump, stated that the United States has the right to take Greenland and could do so militarily if it chose. Miller argued that the world operates on strength and power, and that the U.S. could seize territory and resources in its national interest. These comments followed a social media post by his wife suggesting U.S. control of Greenland and renewed interest from President Trump. Denmark's Prime Minister urged Trump to cease threats of annexation, noting that such an action would undermine NATO. Miller also echoed Trump's stance on Venezuela, asserting U.S. control and the right to exploit its oil reserves, dismissing international treaties as mere 'niceties.' He described the U.S. embargo as giving America permission for Venezuela to conduct commerce or run its economy. Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Miller's remarks, calling them a definition of imperialism and a return to the exploitation of poorer countries by powerful nations.
