## Article summary
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has reached an agreement with 147 countries to prevent global companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries. However, U.S. multinational companies will be exempt from paying the agreed-upon 15% global minimum tax. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent stated that this deal preserves U.S. tax sovereignty and protects incentives for investment and job creation. He described it as a victory for American workers and businesses against extraterritorial overreach. The National Association of Manufacturers also supported the deal, believing it will create a level playing field and prevent oppressive taxes on manufacturers. Conversely, the FACT Coalition criticized the agreement, calling it a setback that allows large American companies to continue sheltering profits in tax havens, prioritizing corporate tax breaks over the interests of ordinary Americans and allies.
