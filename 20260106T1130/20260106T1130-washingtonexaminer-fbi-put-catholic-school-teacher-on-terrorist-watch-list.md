## Article summary
A Senate Republican investigation has revealed that the FBI placed Christine Crowder, a Catholic school teacher and wife of a federal air marshal, on a terrorist watch list based on an unverified tip. The tip, from a former friend, alleged Crowder unlawfully entered the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Despite lacking corroborating evidence like geolocation data or facial recognition, the FBI recommended her inclusion on federal watchlists and flagged her to the TSA. Crowder's husband discovered her designation while performing his duties as an air marshal. The FBI conducted physical surveillance of their home and obtained a warrant for her Facebook account, continuing the investigation for nearly two years. The probe only concluded in June 2023, after an informant raised doubts about Crowder's identity. Her husband testified that the investigation created operational conflicts and represented a "weaponization of federal law enforcement." This case is part of a broader investigation into the TSA's now-terminated Quiet Skies program, which also faced criticism for subjecting individuals to enhanced screening without due process and potentially being used for political purposes.
