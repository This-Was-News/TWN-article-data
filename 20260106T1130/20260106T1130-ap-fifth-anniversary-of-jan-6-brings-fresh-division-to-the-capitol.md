## Article summary
On the fifth anniversary of January 6, 2021, the U.S. Capitol is marked by fresh divisions rather than unified commemoration. Former President Donald Trump is holding a private policy forum with House Republicans, while Democrats plan a hearing with witnesses to the violence and a gathering on the Capitol steps. The former leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, is organizing a march to honor those who died during the siege. The political parties remain divided on their historical interpretation of the events, and an official plaque honoring law enforcement has yet to be displayed. This anniversary occurs amidst heightened international attention, including the U.S. military's capture of Venezuela's president. Democrats intend to hear testimony from individuals who experienced the Jan. 6 violence, including former Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Republicans, however, are focusing on security lapses at the Capitol and have launched a new committee to investigate these issues, rejecting the Democratic session as partisan. The events of Jan. 6 led to five deaths, including Ashli Babbitt and Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick. Trump faces federal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, with prosecutors asserting the riot would not have happened without him. Trump was impeached by the House for inciting the insurrection but acquitted by the Senate, and the Supreme Court has since ruled on presidential immunity from prosecution.
