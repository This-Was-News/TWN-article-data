## Article summary
A trial has begun for Adrian Gonzales, a former Uvalde school police officer accused of failing to protect students during the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting. Gonzales faces 29 counts of child abandonment or endangerment, with a potential maximum sentence of two years in prison if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty, with his attorney stating he attempted to save children. The trial is taking place in Corpus Christi, Texas, after a change of venue was granted due to concerns about a fair trial in Uvalde. Prosecutors allege Gonzales failed to engage, distract, or delay the shooter, and did not follow his training by moving towards the gunfire. Families of the victims are expected to testify, highlighting the 77-minute gap between authorities' arrival and the shooter's neutralization. This case is rare, as charges are seldom brought against officers for inaction during school shootings. Another officer, former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, also faces charges but his trial has not yet been scheduled. State and federal reviews of the incident pointed to significant failures in law enforcement training, communication, and leadership. The prosecution faces a challenging task, as juries have historically been reluctant to convict officers for inaction, as seen in the 2018 Parkland school shooting case where a deputy was acquitted.
