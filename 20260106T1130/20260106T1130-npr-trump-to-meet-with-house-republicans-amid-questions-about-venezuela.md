## Article summary
President Trump is scheduled to meet with House Republicans following the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife by U.S. forces. This meeting comes amid bipartisan calls for more information regarding the operation in Venezuela and the U.S. role moving forward. A closed-door briefing for Capitol Hill leaders revealed a partisan divide on the military operation, with Republicans asserting the president acted within his constitutional authority as commander-in-chief. House Speaker Mike Johnson clarified that the mission was not a "regime change" but a "demand for change in behavior by a regime," and that U.S. troops are not expected to be on the ground. However, some lawmakers, particularly Democrats, expressed concerns about the expansion of presidential powers and the lack of advance congressional notification. Democrats argue that Congress is abdicating its constitutional authority by deferring to the White House. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the administration's plan for Venezuela as vague and expressed concern about potential U.S. involvement in other countries. A separate briefing for all members of Congress on Venezuela is scheduled for Wednesday, where further details are expected. The upcoming meeting with House Republicans is seen as an opportunity for Trump to address his party ahead of the midterm elections.
