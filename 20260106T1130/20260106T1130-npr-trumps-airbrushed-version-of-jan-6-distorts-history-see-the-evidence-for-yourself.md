## Article summary
The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, initially condemned by political leaders, is now subject to a historical rewrite, with President Trump calling it a day of love and the rioters great patriots. NPR has documented every prosecution in a public database, revealing evidence of planning for revolution and the brutality of the violence. The events leading up to Jan. 6 included overlapping crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and protests following George Floyd's murder, alongside Trump's repeated claims of election fraud. The "Stop the Steal" movement gained traction, despite courts universally rejecting fraud claims. On Jan. 6, a rally near the White House preceded the march to the Capitol, where rioters overwhelmed police, breached the building, and disrupted the certification of the election results. The attack resulted in seven deaths, including Ashli Babbitt who was shot by police, and injuries to approximately 140 officers. The federal investigation led to over 1,500 arrests, with significant charges against leaders of extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Despite initial condemnations, Trump later issued mass pardons to Jan. 6 defendants, including those with prior criminal records, and stocked his administration with individuals who advocated for these defendants or were former defendants themselves. Judges across the ideological spectrum condemned the attack as a threat to democracy, emphasizing that court records preserve the truth of the events, regardless of any attempts to alter the narrative.
