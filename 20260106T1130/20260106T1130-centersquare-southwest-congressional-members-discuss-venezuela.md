## Article summary
Southwestern members of Congress have expressed divided opinions regarding the U.S. military's capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Republican U.S. Rep. Abe Hamadeh of Arizona supports the action, viewing Maduro as a "brutal head of a criminal drug cartel" and commending President Trump's "peace through strength" approach. Hamadeh believes this decisive action protects American safety and sovereignty by confronting threats at their source. Conversely, Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona criticizes Trump's move, stating the president "overthrew a foreign ruler" and alleging the motive was to control oil reserves. Kelly argues that such poorly conceived decisions do not enhance American safety and could lead to prolonged U.S. involvement in Venezuela. Other Democrats, including Sens. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Jacky Rosen (Nevada), share Kelly's concerns, questioning the legality of the action without congressional authorization and expressing skepticism about the administration's stated goals. Sen. Tim Kaine (Virginia) has introduced a War Powers Resolution to prevent future military actions in Venezuela without congressional input, emphasizing that the power to declare war rests with Congress. U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley (California), a Republican, supports Maduro's removal, seeing it as a positive development for Venezuela and the Western Hemisphere, while also acknowledging the need for congressional involvement moving forward.
