## Article summary
Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has publicly praised President Donald Trump for his "courageous visions" and "historical actions" in ousting Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Machado, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, expressed deep gratitude on her X account and during an appearance on Fox News' "Hannity," stating that Trump's efforts have brought Venezuelans closer to freedom and made the United States safer. She declared January 3, 2026, as the day tyranny was defeated in Venezuela, a date she believes will be remembered forever. Machado had previously dedicated her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Trump, feeling he deserved it for his role in confronting the "narco-terrorist regime." She reiterated that if she believed he deserved the award in October, his recent actions have further proven his merit. Machado emphasized the significance of Maduro's removal, calling it a "huge step for humanity, for freedom, and human dignity" that should be honored globally. She views January 3rd as a historical milestone where justice triumphed over tyranny.
