## Article summary
Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi defended President Donald Trump's order to arrest former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, asserting that the action "saved countless lives." Bondi argued that Trump's decision was a lawful "law enforcement function" to apprehend indicted individuals and was well within his Article II powers. She highlighted the charges against Maduro and his wife, including directing murders and kidnappings, and their alleged involvement with drug cartels like Tren de Aragua and Sinaloa. Bondi emphasized that Maduro's actions, such as releasing prisoners and facilitating the entry of gang members into the U.S., posed a direct threat to American safety. She specifically mentioned the murders of American women like Laken Riley, Claretha Daniels, and Jocelyn Nungaray, attributing them to members of Tren de Aragua. Bondi stated that Trump's apprehension of Maduro is a crucial step in combating the gang's criminal influence in the United States. This stance aligns with comments made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also asserted that the action did not require congressional approval as it was not an invasion or extended military operation. The article notes that Maduro and his wife are being prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
