## Article summary
The recent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the U.S. has sparked unease regarding the international legal framework, raising concerns about a potential return to a "might makes right" global order. While the U.S. administration defends the action as a justified law enforcement operation against drug cartels, other nations and analysts view it as a violation of international law and the U.N. Charter. This event has led to speculation about future U.S. military interventions, with President Trump's administration signaling a focus on restoring American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere. The capture has drawn criticism from countries like France and Russia, with some warning of serious consequences for global security. The situation also raises concerns for other global hotspots, including Ukraine, Greenland, Taiwan, and the Middle East, as it potentially alters the landscape of international relations and the adherence to established legal norms. The European Union, despite its reliance on U.S. support, has emphasized the importance of upholding international law, while some allies, like Hungary, express skepticism about the effectiveness of international rules in governing powerful nations. The incident underscores a growing tension between national security interests and the principles of international law.
