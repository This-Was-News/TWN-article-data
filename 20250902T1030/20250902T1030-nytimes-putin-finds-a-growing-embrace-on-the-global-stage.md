## Article summary
Three years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared isolated at a Eurasian political summit, facing criticism over his invasion of Ukraine and being shunned by other leaders. However, recent events in Tianjin, China, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, show a shift in Putin's fortunes. He publicly blamed the West for the war in Ukraine and engaged warmly with leaders like India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's Xi Jinping. Other leaders, including those from Iran, Nepal, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Vietnam, also interacted with Putin in private meetings. This change in dynamics suggests that the war in Ukraine is being accepted by some, as noted by a professor of global communication. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed surprise that the summit's final communiqué did not mention the war, despite referencing other global conflicts and events.
