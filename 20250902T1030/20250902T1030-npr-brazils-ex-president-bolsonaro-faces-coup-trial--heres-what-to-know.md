## Article summary
Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is set to face trial for allegedly attempting to overturn democracy after losing the 2022 election. Accused of leading a criminal conspiracy to retain power, Bolsonaro faces five charges, including plotting a coup and attempting to violently end democratic rule. The trial involves seven of his closest allies and is being overseen by Brazil's Supreme Federal Court. Prosecutors allege Bolsonaro urged supporters to storm government buildings and plotted to assassinate political rivals, including current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Key evidence includes a 'coup draft' document allegedly edited by Bolsonaro, which outlined plans to arrest Supreme Court justices and call for new elections. Bolsonaro denies all charges, claiming he was not in Brazil during the January 8, 2023, protests and that any discussions about staying in power were constitutional. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly condemned the trial, calling it a 'witch hunt' and imposing tariffs and sanctions on Brazil. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face decades in prison, though he can appeal. The trial, beginning on Tuesday, is expected to last until September 12 and could significantly impact Brazil's political landscape and international relations.
