## Article summary
A landslide in Sudan's Darfur region has killed over 1,000 people, wiping out the village of Tarasn in the Marrah Mountains. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Army reported the tragedy, appealing for international aid to recover the bodies. Heavy rainfall triggered the disaster, with only one survivor reported. The rebel group's leader described the scale of the disaster as immense. The Sudanese government mobilized resources to support the affected area. The remote village is accessible only by foot or donkey. The Marrah Mountains, a UNESCO World Heritage site, are known for higher rainfall and cooler temperatures. The landslide is one of the deadliest natural disasters in Sudan's recent history. The tragedy occurs amid a devastating civil war that has displaced millions and caused severe humanitarian crises, including famine and restricted access for aid groups.
