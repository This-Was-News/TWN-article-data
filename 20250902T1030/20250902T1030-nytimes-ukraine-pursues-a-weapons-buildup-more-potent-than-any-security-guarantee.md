## Article summary
Ukraine is pursuing a multibillion-dollar arms buildup, funded by Europe, to ensure its long-term survival as U.S. assistance declines and Western security guarantees remain uncertain. Kyiv aims to sustain its army through the current war and make it the backbone of any postwar settlement, deterring Russia from future invasions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has emphasized the need for Ukraine to become a 'steel porcupine,' undefeatable for potential invaders. A new NATO-backed procurement system will channel European funds into purchasing U.S. weapons for Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelensky hoping to secure $1 billion in monthly purchases, focusing on acquiring Patriot air-defense systems. This system will replace U.S. arms donations ended by President Trump and streamline weapon deliveries. A recent sale of cruise missiles and GPS navigation kits worth $825 million was announced. Ukraine is also investing in its booming domestic defense industry, which has already produced battlefield drones and is now developing long-range cruise missiles. However, the extent of this military buildup remains uncertain due to potential budget strains in European nations and persistent manpower shortages in Kyiv's army.
