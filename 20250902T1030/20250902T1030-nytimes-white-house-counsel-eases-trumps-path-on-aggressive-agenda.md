## Article summary
The article discusses the role of David Warrington, President Trump's current White House counsel, who has taken a more lenient approach compared to his predecessor, Donald F. McGahn II. Warrington, with no prior government experience, focuses on advising the president on legal matters and potential consequences of his actions, rather than making decisions for him. He has supported Trump's aggressive legal moves, such as invoking emergency powers, sending troops into cities, investigating perceived foes, raising import taxes, and leveraging concessions from private companies. The article highlights that Warrington's role is different from past counsels due to the absence of a special counsel investigation and the alignment of the Justice Department's top ranks with Trump's personal lawyers. The Supreme Court's recent grant of substantial immunity to presidents for official actions has also influenced the current dynamic. Warrington describes his role as informing the president about the legal landscape and providing guidance, emphasizing that the ultimate decisions are made by Trump himself.
