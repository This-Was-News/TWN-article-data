## Article summary
On September 2, 1945, during the formal surrender of Japan aboard the USS Missouri, Canadian Colonel Lawrence Cosgrave made a significant error. As the highest-ranking Canadian military officer present, Cosgrave was tasked with signing the surrender documents. However, he inadvertently signed on the wrong line, causing a brief diplomatic incident. The Japanese representatives initially refused to accept the document due to the mistake, but the issue was resolved. Despite this, Cosgrave's legacy was largely defined by this error. He was a World War I veteran who had lost an eye and later served as a diplomat in East Asia. Cosgrave was deeply affected by the war and witnessed the devastation of Allied bombing in Japan. His story serves as a reminder not to judge individuals solely based on a single mistake, as his life encompassed much more than this moment.
