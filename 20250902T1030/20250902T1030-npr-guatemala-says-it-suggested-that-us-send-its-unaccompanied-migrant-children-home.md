## Article summary
The Guatemalan government claimed on August 31 that it proposed to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that unaccompanied Guatemalan minors be returned to their home country. The government stated its intention to reunify the children with their families and include them in social programs, asserting that all actions comply with human rights and due process. However, the Guatemalan government did not immediately respond to questions about the number of children requested for return or parental consent. The statement contained a factual error regarding the timing of Noem's visit, which occurred on June 26, not July. During her visit, Noem and Guatemalan Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez signed agreements, including one potentially allowing non-Guatemalan asylum seekers to seek asylum in Guatemala instead of the U.S. Attorneys representing the children dispute Guatemala's claims, arguing that the U.S. violated federal laws and the Constitution by attempting to deport the children without allowing them to complete their asylum claims. A federal judge's emergency order temporarily halted the deportations, and the National Immigration Law Center vowed to continue defending the children's right to stay in the U.S.
