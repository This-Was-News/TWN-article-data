## Article summary
Protests against President Donald Trump and in support of workers' rights erupted in multiple U.S. cities on Labor Day, including Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. Organized by One Fair Wage, demonstrators chanted slogans like 'Trump must go now!' and 'No National Guard' outside Trump Tower in both New York and Chicago. Protesters also called for a living wage, with the federal minimum wage being a key issue. In Washington D.C., crowds gathered with signs demanding an end to ICE invasions and expressing support for immigrant rights. Speeches and chants highlighted concerns about federal law enforcement and the National Guard's presence in cities. Counter-protests and confrontations occurred, including a brief altercation with a Trump supporter in Chicago. Protesters along the West Coast also rallied against billionaire influence and for workers' rights, with marches in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Portland. The protests emphasized the need for collective action to address economic and political issues, with participants expressing frustration over healthcare, immigration, and social security.
