## Article summary
Israel launched strikes across the Gaza Strip, killing at least 31 people, including many women and children, as it presses ahead with a major offensive in Gaza City. Leading genocide scholars have accused Israel of committing genocide, an allegation Israel vehemently rejects. The offensive has led to widespread destruction, with residents reporting explosive-laden robots demolishing buildings. Hospitals in Gaza report a high number of casualties, with over 63,000 Palestinians killed and 160,000 wounded since the war began. The conflict has also led to severe hunger and famine in Gaza, exacerbated by Israel's blockade and ongoing fighting. Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostages in an October 2023 attack, with 48 hostages still in Gaza. The International Association of Genocide Scholars, with around 500 members, including Holocaust experts, passed a resolution stating that Israel's policies and actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide. Israel denies these allegations, stating it is fighting a war of self-defense. Protests in Israel have called for a ceasefire and the release of hostages, with many Israelis accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for political purposes. Meanwhile, an activist flotilla, including climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, set sail from Barcelona to symbolically break Israel's blockade of Gaza.
