## Article summary
Utah is facing a severe shortage of starter homes, with prices skyrocketing and making it difficult for young couples like the Potokars to afford their first home. Governor Spencer Cox set a goal to build 35,000 starter homes in five years to address this issue. Despite efforts like low-interest construction loans and incentives for developers, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. Housing experts suggest that more significant changes, such as altering zoning laws to allow smaller lot sizes, are necessary to create truly affordable homes. One developer, Jed Nelson, has taken up the challenge and is building starter homes in Plain City, Utah, offering them at prices below $400,000. These homes are prioritized for first-time buyers, teachers, first responders, and active military members. The Potokars, who initially gave up on buying a home, were among the first to move into one of these starter homes, feeling lucky and optimistic about their future. Nelson hopes his success will encourage other developers to contribute to solving this societal problem.
