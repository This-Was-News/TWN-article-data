## Article summary
Chinese leader Xi Jinping welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin as an old friend during their meetings in Beijing, as both countries face overlapping and differing challenges from the United States. Putin addressed Xi as 'dear friend' and stated that ties between Moscow and Beijing are at an unprecedentedly high level. The formal meeting was followed by tea with top aides at Zhongnanhai, the center of power in China. China announced it would offer 30-day visa-free access to Russian travelers starting later this month. The talks occurred after both attended a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in nearby Tianjin and before a grand Chinese military parade in Beijing. Putin emphasized the historical and current unity between the two nations, stating, 'We were always together then, we remain together now.' China, while claiming neutrality in the Ukraine war, has provided economic support to Russia through continued trade despite Western sanctions. A memorandum was signed to build another natural gas pipeline to China, and agreements were made to increase gas deliveries via existing routes. Both countries aim to jointly cope with pressure from the U.S., with China positioning itself as a leader for countries disadvantaged by the U.S.-dominated post-World War II order. Xi proposed initiatives to build a more just and equitable global governance system. Additionally, Putin and Xi held a three-way meeting with Mongolian President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, emphasizing shared interests in developing ties.
