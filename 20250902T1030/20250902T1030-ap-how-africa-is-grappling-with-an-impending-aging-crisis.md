## Article summary
Africa is experiencing a significant demographic shift as more people reach old age due to improvements in nutrition, sanitation, and healthcare. This aging population brings both celebration and concern, as the continent struggles to meet the needs of its elderly. In Uganda, the capital Kampala is bustling with young people, but in rural villages, the aging population is becoming more visible. Carole Osero-Agengo of HelpAge International highlights the gaps in services and infrastructure for the elderly. Life expectancy gains have led to a growing elderly population, but Africa lacks the time and resources to prepare for this shift. The African Union and individual countries have plans, but implementation has been uneven. Government support for pensions, healthcare, and caregiving is minimal, and foreign aid cuts have worsened the situation. Organizations like Reach One Touch One (ROTOM) struggle to meet the needs of the elderly, who often face poverty, dementia, and witchcraft accusations. The article also highlights the challenges of aging with HIV and the lack of geriatric healthcare. Despite these struggles, the elderly in Africa find moments of joy and resilience.
