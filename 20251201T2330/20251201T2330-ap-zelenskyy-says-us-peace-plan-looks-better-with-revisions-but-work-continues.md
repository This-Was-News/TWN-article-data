## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed optimism about the revised U.S. peace plan for ending Russia's war, stating it looks better and that work will continue during ongoing talks. Zelenskyy met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris as part of diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Kremlin confirmed Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff. The U.S.-authored peace plan, initially criticized for favoring Russian demands, has been revised following discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. officials. Russia, however, claimed battlefield gains, asserting its troops captured the key city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, a claim disputed by Zelenskyy. Macron described the diplomatic activity as a potential turning point for peace in Ukraine and European security, emphasizing the need for European involvement in finalizing any plan. The U.S. plan, originally proposed by the Trump administration, included controversial points like limiting Ukraine's military and requiring territorial concessions, which Trump has since downplayed. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas voiced concerns that Ukraine might face pressure to make further concessions. In parallel, Russia reported destroying numerous Ukrainian drones, while Ukraine confirmed drone attacks on Russian oil infrastructure. A Russian missile strike in Dnipro killed four people and wounded dozens, with Ukraine reporting a high number of Russian drone launches.
