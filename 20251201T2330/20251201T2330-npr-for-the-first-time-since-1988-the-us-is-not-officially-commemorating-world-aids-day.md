## Article summary
For the first time since its inception in 1988, the United States will not officially commemorate World AIDS Day. This marks a significant departure from tradition, as the U.S. has consistently participated in this global day of remembrance and recommitment to fighting the AIDS epidemic since its creation by the World Health Organization. The State Department stated that "an awareness day is not a strategy," indicating a shift towards a "modernizing approach to countering infectious diseases" under President Trump's leadership. This decision has drawn criticism from HIV/AIDS activists who view it as emblematic of an administration that is perceived as uncaring towards the ongoing epidemic. Despite the U.S. government's stance, countries worldwide are still marking the day with various events and campaigns. The U.S. has historically been a major financial supporter of the global fight against HIV/AIDS through initiatives like PEPFAR. However, recent budget cuts to global health spending have raised concerns about the disruption of HIV/AIDS care in several countries. Activists protested outside the White House, arguing that the decision not to commemorate World AIDS Day symbolizes a lack of political will and a return to the stigma that characterized the early days of the epidemic. They emphasize that commemorative days, however small, play a vital role in combating stigma and saving lives. This decision also aligns with the administration's broader skepticism towards multilateral organizations like the WHO and the UN.
