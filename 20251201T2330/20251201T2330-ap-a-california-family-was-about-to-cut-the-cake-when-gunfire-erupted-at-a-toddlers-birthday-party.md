## Article summary
Gunfire erupted at a toddler's birthday party in Stockton, California, as family members were about to cut the cake. The shooting, which occurred at a banquet hall with at least 100 people gathered, resulted in the deaths of three children and a 21-year-old, with eleven others wounded. The birthday girl, who turned two, was unharmed, but her mother described the chaos and shock of the unexpected violence. Authorities believe the shooting was targeted and may have involved multiple shooters, with gunfire continuing outside the hall. The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office is urging anyone with information to come forward, emphasizing the community's need to reject such behavior. Residents have expressed sadness and placed flowers at a makeshift memorial for the victims. Stockton has a high rate of violent crime, with over 3,600 incidents recorded in the previous year. The mayor expressed deep sorrow for the young victims, noting that counselors would be available at local schools. No arrests have been made in connection with the shooting, though unrelated arrests for weapons and gang charges were made hours later.
