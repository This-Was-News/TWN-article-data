## Article summary
The costume designer for "Wicked" discusses the intentional choices behind Elphaba's attire. Elphaba's decision to wear trousers was influenced by Cynthia Erivo's athletic prowess, allowing for a more expansive physical expression of the character. Elphaba's consistent use of black signifies her early mourning for her mother and serves as a form of self-protection against bullies, creating a distinct identity. The casting of a Black woman as Elphaba highlights the story's themes of ostracization and othering, drawing parallels to the racial dynamics in society. Elphaba's iconic gray, chunky wool sweater, referred to as the "sex cardigan," was designed organically based on her resourcefulness and isolation, reflecting her ability to create clothing from her surroundings. The designer grew up in a highly creative family that encouraged artistic expression through music and theater, influencing their approach to costume design. This background fostered an environment where creativity and cultural engagement were central. The overall approach to Elphaba's costumes emphasizes her character development and the narrative's deeper meanings.
