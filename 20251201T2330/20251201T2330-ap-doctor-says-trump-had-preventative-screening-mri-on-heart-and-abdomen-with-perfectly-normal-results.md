## Article summary
Doctor Sean Barbabella stated that Donald Trump underwent MRI screenings on his heart and abdomen in October as part of a preventative measure for men his age. The White House released a memo from Barbabella detailing that the advanced imaging, considered standard for an executive physical, showed perfectly normal results. This preventative imaging aims to detect issues early and ensure long-term health and function. Trump himself had previously mentioned the results were perfect and indicated he would release them. While Trump stated he didn't know which part of his body the MRI was for, he confirmed it wasn't his brain, as he had recently aced a cognitive test. The doctor's memo was released after Trump's Sunday remarks about making the scan results public. Although described as part of his routine physical, the White House had not previously detailed the specifics of the October scan at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. It's noted that preventive cardiac and abdominal MRIs are not standard screening recommendations, and executive physicals often include non-routine tests for wealthy individuals.
