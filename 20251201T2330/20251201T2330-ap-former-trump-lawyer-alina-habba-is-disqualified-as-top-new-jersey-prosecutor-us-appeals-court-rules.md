## Article summary
A U.S. appeals court has disqualified Alina Habba, former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, from serving as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, stating that Habba's appointment and continued service in the role were unlawful. The court acknowledged the administration's frustration with appointment barriers but emphasized the need for clarity and stability in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey. The decision comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to keep Habba in the powerful post, which enforces federal criminal and civil law, despite her interim appointment expiring and lacking Senate confirmation. Habba had stated she was fighting for other candidates denied Senate hearings. The ruling follows similar challenges to other Trump administration prosecutors' appointments, including Lindsey Halligan in Virginia. The implications for ongoing prosecutions remain unclear, though legal experts suggest it poses a significant challenge to the office's work. Habba's tenure has been marked by politically charged cases, including charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver. The situation escalated when New Jersey's senators did not support her appointment, leading federal judges to replace her with a career prosecutor, only for Attorney General Pam Bondi to reappoint Habba, a move now deemed unlawful by the appeals court.
