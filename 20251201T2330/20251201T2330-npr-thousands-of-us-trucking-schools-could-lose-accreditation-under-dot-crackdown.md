## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Transportation is threatening to revoke the accreditation of nearly 3,000 truck driving schools, with an additional 4,000 potentially facing similar action, unless they comply with federal requirements within 30 days. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to tighten regulations within the trucking industry. The DOT accuses these schools of falsifying training data, failing to meet curriculum and instructor standards, and not maintaining accurate records. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the crackdown aims to prevent poorly trained drivers from operating commercial vehicles. This initiative coincides with proposed restrictions on immigrants obtaining commercial driver's licenses, which have been temporarily halted by a federal appeals court. Critics argue these regulations are an immigration crackdown disguised as a safety measure, lacking supporting data. Immigrant truckers face uncertainty, though some industry members, like trucking company owner Pawan Singh, acknowledge the need for better training, emphasizing that untrained drivers are dangerous regardless of their origin.
