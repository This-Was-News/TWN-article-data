## Article summary
Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva is set to be sworn into the House of Representatives on Wednesday, 50 days after winning her special election in September. House Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to administer the oath of office. Grijalva believes her commitment to signing a bipartisan petition to release the Jeffrey Epstein files contributed to the delay in her being sworn in. This petition requires 218 signatures to force a vote, and Grijalva's signature would be the decisive one. Democrats have accused Johnson of intentionally stalling to prevent a vote on the files, while Johnson denies these accusations. Grijalva won her seat representing Arizona's 7th Congressional District. She has stated that once sworn in, she will sign the Epstein discharge petition to seek justice for survivors. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has called the delays "unbelievable." Grijalva's first expected vote will be on a plan to reopen the government, a plan she stated she would not support due to insufficient concessions for healthcare. The petition to release the Epstein files could trigger a vote by early December.
