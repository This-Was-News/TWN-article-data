## Article summary
Israel's prolonged war with Hamas has resulted in a significant increase in mental health issues and suicides among its soldiers. The Israeli defense ministry has documented nearly 11,000 soldiers suffering from mental health injuries since the October 7th attack, which constitutes over a third of all such injuries recorded since the country's founding. Suicides have also risen, with 21 soldiers dying by suicide last year, an increase from the previous decade's average of 13 per year. Reports indicate that an additional 279 soldiers attempted suicide between January 2024 and July 2025 but survived. The army is actively working to address this crisis by mobilizing mental health officers, providing frontline support, and establishing hotlines and group therapy sessions. However, experts warn that the country is not yet adequately equipped to handle the scale of the problem, which impacts the entire national health system. The prolonged and intense nature of the war, with repeated deployments, has prevented soldiers from properly healing, leading to potential long-term consequences. Many soldiers report feeling a lack of purpose, difficulty concentrating, and struggles with relationships, contributing to a sense of hopelessness. Organizations like the Back2Life farm are emerging to provide support through animal-assisted therapy, helping soldiers reconnect with life and process their experiences. Despite these efforts, stigma surrounding mental health persists among soldiers, which the rehabilitation program director acknowledges as a top priority to combat through public campaigns and targeted programs.
