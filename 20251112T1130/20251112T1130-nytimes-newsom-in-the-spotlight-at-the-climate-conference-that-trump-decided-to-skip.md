## Article summary
Governor Gavin Newsom of California positioned himself as a leading American voice on climate action at the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, an event the Trump administration chose to skip. Newsom highlighted California's commitment to renewable energy and criticized President Trump's approach, arguing it threatens American competitiveness by allowing China to dominate the clean energy market. He urged Democrats to frame climate change as a cost-of-living issue, emphasizing economic implications over abstract environmental concerns. Newsom contrasted California's proactive stance with Trump's disavowal of global climate cooperation and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. While Trump's White House spokeswoman criticized Newsom's appearance as promoting a "Green New Scam," Newsom insisted California is a "stable and reliable partner" on the global stage. He also spoke out against proposed offshore drilling near California and expressed concern over U.S. military actions abroad. Newsom's trip followed a successful ballot initiative aimed at boosting California Democrats in upcoming elections. Despite past criticism of the fossil fuel industry, Newsom recently implemented measures to ease oil drilling in California, calling it a pragmatic move. He vowed to block any federal proposals for offshore drilling off the California coast.
