## Article summary
The U.S. military has conducted over a dozen strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, claiming they were involved in drug trafficking and targeting "narco-terrorists." These strikes have resulted in the deaths of over 70 people, with grainy video footage released on social media by President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The administration has not provided further public evidence to substantiate these claims. A key focus of this strategy is targeting Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated a foreign terrorist organization. President Trump has accused this group of violent criminal activity in the U.S. and stated the military is being used to destroy Venezuelan terrorist and trafficking networks. The Venezuelan government denies any involvement in drug trafficking. Legal scholars are questioning the executive branch's authority to conduct these strikes in international waters without congressional authorization. There are also reports of civilian casualties, including a Colombian fisherman allegedly killed in a September strike, which has further strained relations between the U.S. and some Latin American countries.
