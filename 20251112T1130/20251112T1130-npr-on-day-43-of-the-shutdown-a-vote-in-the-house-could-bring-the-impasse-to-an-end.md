## Article summary
On day 43 of the government shutdown, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on a funding bill that could end the impasse. The Senate approved the legislation, which extends funding for much of the government through January 30 and fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026. This measure also includes a provision to reverse layoffs imposed during the shutdown. However, many Democrats are critical of the deal because it does not address the core issue of expiring health care subsidies. As a compromise, Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote by mid-December on legislation to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits, though its passage in the House is not guaranteed. Moderate Democrats believe the shutdown has increased pressure on Republicans to find a healthcare solution. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged House Democrats to vote against the bill, arguing it harms American healthcare. Opponents contend that recent election results signal voter support for action on healthcare. While Republicans believe the shutdown's disruptions will harm Democrats, President Trump suggested it hurt the Republican party. The long-term impact of the shutdown on voter decisions remains uncertain, especially with ongoing economic concerns.
