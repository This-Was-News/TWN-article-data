## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Justice is appealing a federal judge's order mandating the White House to provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation during press briefings involving President Trump or Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. The appeal, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, seeks clarification on which types of events require ASL interpretation, suggesting it should be limited to regularly scheduled briefings rather than other events where the president might take questions. The Justice Department also noted that their current vendor agreement requires 24 hours' notice for ASL interpreter services. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali issued the preliminary injunction on November 4, stating that excluding deaf Americans from White House programming violates the Rehabilitation Act and causes clear and present harm. The lawsuit was filed in May by the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and two deaf men, alleging discrimination based on the White House's failure to provide ASL interpretation, which they argue violates the Rehabilitation Act and the First and Fifth Amendments. The NAD contends that ASL and English are distinct languages, and captions alone are insufficient for full access. While the judge ordered ASL interpretation for press briefings, he did not extend the requirement to events involving the vice president, first lady, or second lady, nor to all uploads on White House platforms at this time. The NAD plans to continue pursuing the full relief sought in their lawsuit.
