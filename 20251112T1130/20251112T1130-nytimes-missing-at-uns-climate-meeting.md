## Article summary
Many American corporate executives are absent from the annual United Nations climate summit in Belém, Brazil, a notable shift from previous years. This absence is interpreted as a reflection of the current political climate in the U.S., with some executives suggesting climate change may not warrant the attention it once received. While not outright climate deniers, their stance represents a rejection of past advocacy and commitments made under different political conditions. Top U.S. government officials are also skipping the summit for the first time in 30 years. Executives like Darren Woods of Exxon, while attending other events, have expressed that the focus should be on reducing emissions from oil and gas, not eliminating these resources. Concerns exist that public commitments to climate action could antagonize President Trump and his administration, which has actively dismantled federal climate efforts. Several major tech companies have also acknowledged missing climate targets due to energy demands from data centers. In contrast, Governor Gavin Newsom of California criticized the Trump administration's absence and urged corporate leaders not to retreat from climate discussions. Michael Bloomberg announced a $100 million investment from his foundation to reduce methane emissions. Some international business leaders, like Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest, did attend, demonstrating continued commitment to tackling climate change and expressing optimism about the economics of clean energy.
