## Article summary
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its forecast regarding peak global fossil fuel demand. Previously, the IEA projected that oil, gas, and coal demand could level off by 2030 due to government energy policies and the rapid adoption of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles. This earlier projection was seen as a significant development in the fight against climate change. However, the IEA's latest World Energy Outlook presents a more complex picture. While still including a scenario where policies to combat climate change lead to a plateau or decline in fossil fuel use by 2035, the agency has introduced a new, more conservative scenario. This "current policies" scenario assumes no new energy policies will be enacted and that obstacles will hinder the shift to cleaner energy. Under this more cautious outlook, which was reportedly influenced by pressure from the Trump administration, oil and gas demand is projected to rise steadily through 2050, potentially leading to greater global warming. The agency's updated message emphasizes that the future of fossil fuel demand is increasingly uncertain and dependent on policy choices.
