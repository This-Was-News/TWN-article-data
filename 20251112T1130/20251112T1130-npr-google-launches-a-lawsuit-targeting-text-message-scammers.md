## Article summary
Google has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against a China-based criminal organization called "Lighthouse." This organization allegedly operates a "Phishing-as-a-Service" model, selling software kits with hundreds of fake website templates to scammers. Google claims nearly 200 of these templates mimic U.S. sites, including those of official government agencies and the postal service, often using Google's logo to deceive users. The lawsuit targets the infrastructure behind these scams, aiming for deterrence rather than direct prosecution of the unknown defendants, referred to as "Does 1-25." Google's general counsel stated that the Lighthouse network has targeted victims in over 120 countries, potentially compromising millions of credit cards. While Google did not provide a specific dollar figure for damages, they highlighted the vast number of fake U.S. Postal Service websites created. The tech giant hopes this legal action will provide a basis to collaborate with other platforms to dismantle the illegal infrastructure. In addition to the lawsuit, Google publicly supports three bipartisan bills in Congress aimed at combating scams, including the GUARD Act, the Foreign Robocall Elimination Act, and the SCAM Act. This legal action occurs amidst Google's ongoing antitrust challenges, including recent rulings regarding search data sharing and digital advertising practices, and a settlement with Epic Games over its Play app store.
