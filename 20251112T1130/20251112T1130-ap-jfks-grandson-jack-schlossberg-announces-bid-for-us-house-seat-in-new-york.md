## Article summary
John F. Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York. He aims to win a key seat in the 12th District, which includes Manhattan's Upper West Side, Upper East Side, and midtown. This seat is being vacated by longtime Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, who is not seeking reelection after 17 terms. Schlossberg, a Democrat, stated his intention to bring the district's creativity, energy, and drive to Washington. His campaign is set to officially launch on Wednesday. Schlossberg has gained a significant social media following for his commentary on national issues, including public criticism of his cousin, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Nadler suggested that a younger representative might better serve the district. The 12th District has been represented by Nadler since 1992.
