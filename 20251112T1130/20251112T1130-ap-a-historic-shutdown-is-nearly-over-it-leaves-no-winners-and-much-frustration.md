## Article summary
The longest government shutdown in history, lasting 43 days, is nearing its end with no clear victors and widespread frustration. Democrats failed to secure provisions for health insurance, while Republicans faced blame for the shutdown's impact. Millions of Americans, including federal workers who missed paychecks and airline passengers facing delays, experienced hardship. The agreement includes bipartisan bills to fund specific government sectors like food aid and veterans programs, with other funding extended to late January. Democrats had sought an extension of an enhanced tax credit for health coverage, which was set to expire, potentially doubling premiums and leading to millions losing insurance. Republicans initially insisted on passing a funding bill before negotiating, leading to a stalemate. This shutdown mirrors past political battles over healthcare legislation. The Trump administration has seen significant federal worker departures and dismantling of agencies. Democrats have struggled to block administration priorities through legislation, often relying on the courts. The political stakes were high, with both parties actively shaping public opinion. Polls indicated that a majority of Americans held both Trump and Democrats responsible for the shutdown. Election results in Virginia and elsewhere were seen as indicators of public sentiment, with Democrats experiencing successes. Economically, the shutdown is estimated to have caused a permanent loss of around $11 billion, with most of the impact recoverable but not entirely. Beyond financial losses, the shutdown caused significant stress for federal workers, disrupted travel, and impacted recipients of vital safety net programs, leading to increased demand at food banks. The dysfunction was also seen as damaging to America's international standing, signaling unreliability to allies and a lack of unity to adversaries.
