A Turkish military cargo plane, a C-130, crashed in Georgia's Sighnaghi municipality, resulting in the deaths of all 20 personnel on board. The aircraft had departed from Ganja, Azerbaijan, and was en route to Turkey when contact was lost shortly after entering Georgian airspace. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation, with a Turkish accident investigation team coordinating with Georgian authorities at the site. Georgian Interior Minister Gela Geladze confirmed that the remains of 18 victims had been recovered, with efforts ongoing to find the remaining two.

The aircraft, manufactured in 1968 and added to the Turkish Armed Forces inventory in 2010, was reportedly part of the 12th Air Base Command in Kayseri. Both Azerbaijan and NATO officials have extended their condolences to Turkey. The incident occurred near the Georgia-Azerbaijan border, a region where Turkey and Azerbaijan maintain close military cooperation. Details regarding funeral arrangements or the return of the remains have not yet been released.
