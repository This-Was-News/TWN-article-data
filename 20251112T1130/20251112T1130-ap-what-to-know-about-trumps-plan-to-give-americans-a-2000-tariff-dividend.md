## Article summary
President Donald Trump has proposed a "tariff dividend" of at least $2,000 per person, excluding high-income individuals, to be paid for by the revenue generated from his tariffs. This idea was announced on his Truth Social platform following recent election losses attributed to voter discontent with the economy and high cost of living. Budget experts have expressed skepticism, citing that the projected revenue from tariffs would not be sufficient to fund such a dividend. The U.S. collected $195 billion in tariffs in the last fiscal year, which is less than 4% of federal revenue and has not significantly reduced the budget deficit. Analysts estimate that a $2,000 dividend for all Americans would cost around $600 billion annually, far exceeding tariff revenues. Furthermore, implementing such a dividend would require congressional legislation, which is not guaranteed. Adding to the uncertainty, the legality of Trump's broad tariff policy is being challenged in the Supreme Court, with justices appearing skeptical of the administration's broad executive power claims. If the tariffs are struck down, importers might receive refunds instead of American families receiving dividends. Economists also point out that tariffs are ultimately paid by U.S. importers, who often pass the costs onto consumers through higher prices, suggesting that removing tariffs would be a more direct way to provide relief to Americans.
