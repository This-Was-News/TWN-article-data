## Article summary
An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis during a new immigration crackdown. The incident occurred in a residential neighborhood, and bystander videos show an officer firing into the woman's SUV as it moved. The victim, Renee Nicole Macklin Good, was described as a poet, writer, wife, and mother. Her killing has sparked protests, marking at least the fifth death associated with the Trump administration's immigration operation. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the ICE officer acted in self-defense, claiming the woman "weaponized her vehicle" and attempted to run over an officer. However, Minneapolis officials, including Mayor Jacob Frey, have strongly disputed this narrative, calling it "garbage" and "avoidable." Frey criticized the federal deployment of officers, stating it "rips families apart" and "sows chaos." The shooting has intensified clashes between federal and local authorities regarding the immigration crackdown and its consequences.
