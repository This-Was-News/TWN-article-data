## Article summary
President Donald Trump anticipates U.S. oil companies will invest heavily in Venezuela following the capture of Nicolas Maduro. However, the oil industry remains hesitant due to unresolved questions about Venezuela's future government, U.S. control over oil assets, and logistical challenges. Executives from major oilfield service providers and producers are set to meet with administration officials to voice their concerns. Key issues include the need for sanctions relief on Venezuelan crude and the lifting of the U.S. blockade on sanctioned oil. Industry experts suggest these actions could signal a more favorable environment for investment. For long-term development, companies require assurances regarding return on investment, political stability, financial backing, and physical safety. The U.S. Export-Import Bank could potentially facilitate loans for projects. Analysts caution that a swift outcome is unlikely, as fundamental questions about security, stability, and legalities need to be addressed. Companies are waiting for further proposals and moves from the Trump administration before making significant business decisions, emphasizing the need for long-term U.S. government support that transcends presidential terms.
