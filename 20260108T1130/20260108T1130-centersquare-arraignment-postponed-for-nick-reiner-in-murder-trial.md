## Article summary
The arraignment for Nick Reiner, accused of murdering his parents Rob and Michele Reiner, has been postponed. His high-profile attorney, Alan Jackson, withdrew from the case without providing a reason, though he stated Reiner is not guilty. Reiner did not enter a plea, and his arraignment is now scheduled for February 23. He faces two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances and a special allegation for using a dangerous weapon, potentially leading to a life sentence without parole or the death penalty. Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a statewide moratorium on the death penalty. The district attorney's office alleges Reiner fatally stabbed his parents, both 70, on December 14 at their home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles, where he also resided. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed the cause of death as homicide due to multiple sharp force injuries. Rob Reiner was a renowned actor and director, known for "All in the Family," "The Princess Bride," and "When Harry Met Sally." His father, Carl Reiner, created "The Dick Van Dyke Show."
