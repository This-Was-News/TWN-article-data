## Article summary
Nationwide protests in Iran, initially sparked by economic concerns, have escalated into anti-government demonstrations, fueled by a severe economic crisis, a collapsing rial, and rising inflation. The protests have spread across numerous provinces, resulting in significant casualties and arrests. Iran's "Axis of Resistance," a coalition of Tehran-backed groups, has been weakened by recent conflicts, including the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. has issued warnings against violent suppression of protesters, with President Trump stating the U.S. would intervene if peaceful demonstrators are harmed. Tensions are also high regarding Iran's nuclear program, which the U.S. and international bodies suspect could be weaponized, despite Iran's claims of peaceful intent. The complex relationship between Iran and the U.S. has a long history of volatility, marked by the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the hostage crisis, and the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. The ongoing unrest and international scrutiny place considerable pressure on Iran's theocratic government.
