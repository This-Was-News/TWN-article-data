## Article summary
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has temporarily suspended a permanent injunction against California's gender secrecy policies in public schools. This decision halts a class-wide injunction that was previously granted by U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez. The appellate court found no clear evidence that these policies prevent parents from accessing information about their children's gender identities. The court's order stated that other parties would not be substantially harmed by the stay, as the policies do not categorically forbid disclosure without student consent. The public interest in protecting students and avoiding confusion among school staff also weighed in favor of the stay. The lawsuit originated in April 2023 when two Escondido teachers sued their school district and the California Department of Education. The Thomas More Society, representing the plaintiffs, expressed disappointment and plans to seek reconsideration from the Ninth Circuit and an emergency request to the U.S. Supreme Court. California Attorney General Rob Bonta's office, however, expressed pleasure with the Ninth Circuit's decision, stating it protects vulnerable students and avoids confusion while they appeal the district court's ruling. The policies in question require teachers to use a student's preferred pronouns and withhold gender identity information from parents if the student requests it. Biological pronouns and legal names are used when communicating with parents if the student asks that they not be informed.
