## Article summary
Officials within Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's administration allegedly suppressed fraud reports and retaliated against whistleblowers, contributing to an estimated $9 billion in taxpayer-funded social services fraud. Republican Minnesota state lawmakers testified at a congressional hearing, detailing how whistleblowers have faced significant pressure and fear of retaliation, including threats of job loss and blacklisting. One compliance specialist, Faye Bernstein, was involuntarily transferred after reporting sloppy contracting practices and now advises others against reporting fraud anonymously. Whistleblowers have also reported veiled threats and personal information being used against them, such as pictures of their homes appearing in personnel files. Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan has publicly criticized whistleblowers, and following a significant 2019 report on child care fraud, the Office of Inspector General within the state's DHS was reportedly shut down and prohibited from conducting criminal investigations. The department also shifted its terminology from 'fraud' to 'overbilling' and created a committee to review cases for potential recovery. A report by the Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor found evidence of documents being created or backdated after audits. Democrats on the House Committee expressed frustration, arguing that the administration's response to fraud in 'blue states' is more aggressive than in 'red states,' citing a larger welfare scheme in Mississippi that has received less attention. In response to widespread fraud across several states with Democratic governors, the Trump administration has frozen federal social services funding, a move that could impact hundreds of thousands of children who are not involved in the fraudulent activities.
