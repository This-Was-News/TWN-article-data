## Article summary
The House of Representatives is set to vote today on a bill to extend government subsidies for the Affordable Care Act for three years. This vote is the result of a bipartisan coalition that bypassed House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is reportedly opposed to the measure. The subsidies expired at the end of 2025 and were a key factor in the record-breaking 43-day government shutdown. Nine Republicans joined Democrats in a procedural vote to advance the bill. While the bill is expected to pass the House, its prospects in the Senate are uncertain. A bipartisan group of senators, including Republican Bernie Moreno, are working on a deal for the subsidies, with Moreno expressing cautious optimism about a potential agreement.
