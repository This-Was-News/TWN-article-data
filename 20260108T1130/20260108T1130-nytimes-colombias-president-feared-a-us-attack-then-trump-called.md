## Article summary
Colombian President Gustavo Petro feared a U.S. attack after President Trump's rhetoric, especially after Trump's actions in Venezuela. Petro, a leftist leader, responded with public protests and strong social media posts, fearing he might be removed from office. However, Trump unexpectedly called Petro, leading to a lengthy conversation that seemingly defused the crisis. Following the call, Trump posted positively about Petro, expressing appreciation and arranging a White House visit. This call marked a significant shift from their previously hostile relationship, which had included disputes over military flights, support for Israel, and accusations related to drug trafficking. Petro had accused the U.S. of murder in drug interdictions and using them to distract from the Epstein scandal, leading Trump to label Petro an illegal drug dealer. Despite these tensions and U.S. counternarcotics aid for decades, cocaine production in Colombia has continued to rise. Concerns about potential U.S. military action were high, with Senator Chuck Schumer seeking assurances from the Trump administration. Petro rallied his supporters, who protested against perceived U.S. interference. After the call, Petro appeared relieved and announced plans to visit Washington, signaling a potential thaw in diplomatic relations.
