## Article summary
The White House has stated that all options, including diplomacy, are on the table regarding President Trump's interest in acquiring Greenland. This statement comes amidst concerns about the administration's foreign policy, particularly after a military operation in Venezuela. Trump has consistently expressed interest in Greenland since 2019, citing its strategic importance in the Arctic and its rare earth minerals, while also noting the presence of Russian and Chinese ships in the area. European leaders, including those from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the UK, have defended Greenland's sovereignty, asserting that its future is solely for Denmark and Greenland to decide. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has strongly opposed Trump's comments, warning that a U.S. military action against Greenland could jeopardize NATO. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration's approach, suggesting that ruling out options is not their strategy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed this sentiment, stating that while military intervention is not a preference, presidents generally retain all options. However, Republican leaders in Congress, such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, have expressed skepticism about military action, emphasizing the lack of conflict or intention to wage war with Greenland. Democrats, like Senator Ruben Gallego, have strongly opposed the idea of military intervention, with Gallego planning to introduce a resolution to block any such action.
