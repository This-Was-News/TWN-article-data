## Article summary
President Trump stated that the United States anticipates managing Venezuela and extracting its oil reserves for an extended period, potentially lasting for years. He asserted that the interim government, comprised of former loyalists to Nicolás Maduro, is cooperating fully with U.S. demands. Trump indicated that the U.S. plans to rebuild Venezuela profitably, utilizing its oil resources to lower global prices and provide much-needed funds to the nation. This plan involves the U.S. assuming indefinite control over the sale of Venezuelan oil. While Republican lawmakers have largely supported these actions, Democrats have voiced concerns about a prolonged international intervention lacking clear legal authority. Trump did not provide a specific timeline for U.S. oversight, suggesting it would be "much longer" than a year. He also did not address questions regarding his recognition of Delcy Rodríguez as Venezuela's new leader over opposition leader María Corina Machado. Trump highlighted the success of the operation that captured Maduro, contrasting it with past failed U.S. military operations. He mentioned securing 30 to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan crude oil but acknowledged that reviving the country's neglected oil sector would take years. Trump remained tight-lipped about specific conditions that might lead to deploying American troops or other potential escalations, emphasizing the current cooperation from the Venezuelan administration.
