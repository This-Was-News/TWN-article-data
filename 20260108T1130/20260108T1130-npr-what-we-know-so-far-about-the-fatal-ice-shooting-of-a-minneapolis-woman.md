## Article summary
Thousands gathered in Minneapolis to mourn Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. The incident occurred on a residential street during targeted immigration enforcement operations. Federal officials, including President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, characterized the shooting as an act of self-defense, with Noem stating the woman "weaponized her vehicle" and acted with "domestic terrorism." Conversely, state and local leaders, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Gov. Tim Walz, dispute this narrative, calling for a full and fair investigation and accusing federal authorities of spreading propaganda. Videos of the shooting show an ICE agent firing into the vehicle as it reverses and then drives forward. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara expressed concern over the tactics used, noting that most agencies are trained to minimize the need for deadly force, especially when dealing with unarmed individuals in vehicles. The shooting, which happened near the site of George Floyd's killing in 2020, has heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Minneapolis. The FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating the use of deadly force.
