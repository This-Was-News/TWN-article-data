## Article summary
Colombian President Gustavo Petro has escalated his public criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly regarding the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Petro has denounced the U.S. actions as a violation of Latin American sovereignty and an attack comparable to historical atrocities. Historically, Colombia has been a key ally of the U.S. in the region, cooperating on issues like drug trafficking and counter-insurgency. However, Petro has taken a strong stance against Trump's rhetoric, even calling for a three-way meeting between Colombia, the U.S., and Venezuela. Despite their past animosity, Petro and Trump recently held a phone call, leading to a surprising détente. Trump invited Petro to the White House, indicating a willingness to change his approach. This shift highlights how both leaders may prioritize their interests over ideological differences. For Colombia, maintaining a strong security partnership with the U.S. is crucial, especially with upcoming elections and ongoing peace efforts. Petro has strategically used his conflict with Trump to bolster his image as a defender of national sovereignty, especially as he faces domestic political challenges. While experts doubted the likelihood of a U.S. military operation against Colombia, the situation created significant alarm among Colombian officials, who were preparing for potential aggression. Ultimately, Petro's diplomatic efforts seem to have de-escalated the immediate tensions, prioritizing peace and dialogue.
