## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to plan for potential military action in Nigeria, escalating his claims of Christian persecution. Trump warned that the U.S. would cease all aid to Nigeria if the government continues to allow the killing of Christians, stating the U.S. might "completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities." This warning follows Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's pushback against Trump's earlier designation of Nigeria as a country of particular concern for allegedly failing to curb Christian persecution. Tinubu asserted that Nigeria is not religiously intolerant and opposes religious persecution, emphasizing constitutional guarantees for all faiths. Trump had previously stated that Christianity faces an existential threat in Nigeria, attributing it to radical Islamists. The U.S. designation of Nigeria as a country of particular concern was first made in 2020 but lifted in 2023. While Christians are targeted, analysts suggest Muslims are the majority victims of armed groups in Nigeria's north. Nigeria's government reiterated its commitment to protecting all citizens, regardless of religion, and highlighted its diversity as a strength.
