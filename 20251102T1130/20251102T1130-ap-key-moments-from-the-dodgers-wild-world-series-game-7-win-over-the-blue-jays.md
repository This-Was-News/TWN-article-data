## Article summary
The Los Angeles Dodgers secured their second consecutive World Series title by defeating the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in an exhilarating Game 7 that went into extra innings. The Blue Jays initially took a 3-0 lead in the third inning with a three-run homer from Bo Bichette off Dodgers pitcher Shohei Ohtani. Tensions flared in the fourth inning when both benches cleared after Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski hit Andrés Giménez with a pitch. Max Muncy narrowed the deficit to 4-3 with a solo homer in the eighth, but the Dodgers tied the game in the ninth on Miguel Rojas's historic home run, the first in the ninth inning or later of a Game 7. The Dodgers escaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth thanks to crucial defensive plays, including a close force out at home by Will Smith and a game-saving catch by Andy Pages. In the 11th inning, Will Smith hit a go-ahead solo home run, setting a record for most innings caught in a single World Series. Yoshinobu Yamamoto closed out the game in the bottom of the 11th with a double play, clinching the championship and earning him the World Series MVP award.
