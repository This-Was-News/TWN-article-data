## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, has gained national attention for his focus on affordability, resonating with young voters across the country. Despite living in states like Mississippi, Florida, and Michigan, voters like Lea Ash, Emily Wilson, and Daisy Lupa are inspired by Mamdani's platform, which includes promises to freeze rent and build affordable housing. Mamdani's campaign, centered on addressing rising costs, has energized a youth coalition that turned out in high numbers during the primary. His proposals, such as creating city-run grocery stores and making public transit free, aim to tackle economic challenges faced by many young Americans. While critics question the feasibility of his ambitious plans, Mamdani's anti-establishment message appeals to a generation disillusioned with traditional politics. This sentiment is echoed by research indicating that young people feel unheard and are looking for leaders who challenge the status quo. The hope is that if Mamdani wins, it will encourage other cities to prioritize issues like housing affordability. However, some voters, like Dillon Robertson, express concern about whether his promises can be realistically implemented, even as they remain open to trying something new.
