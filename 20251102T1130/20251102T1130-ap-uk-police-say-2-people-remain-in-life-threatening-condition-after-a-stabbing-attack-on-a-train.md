## Article summary
British police have stated that two individuals remain in critical condition following a stabbing incident on a London-bound train. Initially, ten people were reported injured, with nine in life-threatening condition. However, four have since been discharged, and one additional person sought hospital care independently, bringing the total injured to eleven. The police do not currently classify the attack as a terrorist incident, although a counter-terrorism alert code was briefly activated and later rescinded. Two men, a 32-year-old Black British man and a 35-year-old man of Caribbean descent, both born in the UK, have been arrested and remain in custody. The attack occurred on a train traveling from Doncaster to London Kings Cross, near Huntingdon. Witnesses described scenes of panic, with passengers being warned to run from an assailant. Emergency services, including armed police and air ambulances, responded promptly, and the situation was contained upon the train's arrival at Huntingdon station. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and local mayor Paul Bristow have expressed their concern for those affected. The incident has caused significant disruption to rail services on the East Coast Mainline.
