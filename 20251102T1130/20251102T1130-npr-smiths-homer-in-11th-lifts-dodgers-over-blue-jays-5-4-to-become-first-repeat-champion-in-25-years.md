## Article summary
Will Smith's extra-inning home run in the 11th inning secured a 5-4 victory for the Los Angeles Dodgers over the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series. This win marks the Dodgers as the first repeat champions in 25 years. The game was a dramatic back-and-forth affair, with Miguel Rojas hitting a game-tying home run in the ninth inning for the Dodgers. Toronto had initially led 3-0 and later 4-2, but the Dodgers fought back. World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto played a crucial role, escaping jams and contributing on the mound. Smith's decisive homer came off pitcher Shane Bieber, giving the Dodgers their first lead of the night. The game also featured a record-setting defensive play by Dodgers' outfielder Andy Pages and ended with a unique double play to seal the championship. This series was notable for numerous historic moments, including the first pinch-hit grand slam and an 18-inning game. The Dodgers' victory, their ninth championship and third in six years, solidifies their status as a dynasty in the 2020s.
