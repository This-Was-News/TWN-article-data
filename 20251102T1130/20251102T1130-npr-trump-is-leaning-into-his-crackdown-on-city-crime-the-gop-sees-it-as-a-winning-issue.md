## Article summary
President Trump is intensifying his national crackdown on city crime, threatening to deploy more than just the National Guard to combat what he describes as dangerous urban environments. This initiative, which began with a focus on Washington, D.C., has expanded into a nationwide campaign portraying Trump and Republicans as tough on crime while accusing Democrats of being lenient. Despite the White House claiming a need to address crime, violent crime in D.C. was at a 30-year low before the National Guard's arrival. Trump has also deployed troops to other cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, and Portland, sparking protests and lawsuits. While Democratic leaders accuse the White House of exaggerating issues for an illegal military occupation, Trump views this strategy as a winning issue for the upcoming midterms, potentially stronger than immigration. Political data suggests a significant portion of Americans perceive crime as rising, even though FBI statistics show a decrease. A Gallup poll indicates that while more Americans oppose the use of federal troops to combat domestic crime, Republicans overwhelmingly support it, while Democrats oppose it. This issue taps into a fundamental quality of life concern for many citizens who judge safety based on their personal experiences rather than statistics. Republicans have historically embraced law and order, but Trump's approach, particularly the deployment of troops in cities, is seen as an unprecedented fulfillment of his campaign promises to his base.
