## Article summary
A Michigan defense lawyer is challenging FBI Director Kash Patel's claims that his 20-year-old client and four other young individuals were planning a Halloween terror attack. Patel announced the arrests on Friday, stating more information would follow, but details from the FBI and Michigan authorities have been scarce. Two individuals briefed on the investigation, speaking anonymously to the Associated Press, confirmed online chat room discussions among some suspects, including a reference to "pumpkin day" related to an alleged Halloween attack plot. However, Amir Makled, the lawyer representing one of the detained suspects from Dearborn, stated that federal authorities have provided few details. Makled concluded that no terror event was planned and does not anticipate charges will be filed, questioning the "hysteria and fearmongering." He described the group, aged 16 to 20, as gamers and U.S. citizens, suggesting their online activities might not have been illegal. Authorities had previously stated there was no further threat to public safety after the arrests. Patel had claimed the FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack by arresting subjects allegedly plotting violence over Halloween weekend, inspired by Islamic State group extremism. It remains unclear if the suspects had the means to carry out an attack, but the Halloween reference prompted the FBI's actions. Patel credited the FBI's vigilance and local authorities for thwarting the alleged plot.
