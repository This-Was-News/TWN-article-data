## Article summary
The federal government shutdown has exposed President Trump's strategy of using the fiscal standoff to advance his agenda, prioritizing certain groups while leaving others vulnerable. Despite having billions of dollars available, the administration initially signaled it could not sustain the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which serves 42 million low-income individuals. This move came after the White House had already reprogrammed funds to ensure paychecks for the military and law enforcement. Critics argue that Trump is willing to harm vulnerable populations to benefit his allies and priorities, contrasting with his efforts to shield certain sectors from the shutdown's impact. The administration's actions have been described as bending the rules of budget to reap political benefits or exact retribution. While Trump claimed he had no power to help SNAP recipients, he later signaled a willingness to release funds after a court intervention. This selective relief extends to other programs like Head Start and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which face shortfalls or proposed cuts. The peril facing SNAP prompted lawsuits, with two courts ruling against the administration's actions and ordering the release of emergency funds. Trump's approach reflects a broader vision to shrink domestic spending, particularly on anti-poverty initiatives, while increasing funding for the military and deportation agencies.
