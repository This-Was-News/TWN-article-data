## Article summary
SNAP recipients are facing anxiety and making difficult choices due to uncertainty over federal funding for the program. At a grocery store in Springfield, Massachusetts, shoppers like Angela Duncan expressed worry about dwindling benefits and rising prices, leading them to buy less and stretch their food further. Federal courts ordered the Trump administration to continue funding SNAP through the government shutdown, but delays in distribution caused continued concern. Many families, including children, older adults, and veterans, rely on these benefits, with Springfield having a high rate of SNAP usage. Store employees also face potential reductions in hours due to decreased customer spending. Shoppers are adapting by limiting meals and prioritizing essential items, with some expressing frustration that those in need face such uncertainty. Community efforts, including donations to food banks and local initiatives, are underway to help alleviate the crisis. Despite the challenges, some recipients express gratitude for living in the United States, noting this is the first time they have faced such issues.
