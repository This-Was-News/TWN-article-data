## Article summary
The federal government shutdown has reached a critical point, impacting essential services like food assistance and healthcare for millions of Americans. Plans to halt payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) were temporarily blocked by federal judges, but uncertainty remains about future benefits, leaving many struggling to afford groceries. This crisis exacerbates the existing strain caused by missed paychecks for federal workers and increasing air travel delays, marking the second-longest shutdown in history. Food pantries are seeing a surge in demand, with people expressing desperation and frustration over the ongoing impasse. Lawmakers remain entrenched in their positions, with little urgency to end the shutdown, as President Trump demands action and Democrats warn of an uproar over rising health insurance costs. The annual sign-up for the Affordable Care Act also began, revealing sharp increases in premiums due to expiring tax credits, which Democrats are pushing to extend. While some Republicans are open to extending subsidies, they also seek changes to the healthcare law. The stalemate continues as the country waits for Congress to act, with dire consequences for those relying on SNAP and affordable healthcare.
