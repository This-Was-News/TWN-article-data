## Article summary
As federal food aid for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) faces funding issues due to a government shutdown, a grassroots movement of "grocery buddies" has emerged nationwide. Individuals like Alicia Spradley in Chicago, Hannah Coburn in Spokane, Washington, and Karie Fugett in Dothan, Alabama, are stepping up to help strangers and neighbors by purchasing groceries or sending gift cards. These "buddies" are motivated by personal experiences with hardship, a desire to give back, and a frustration with the political inaction affecting millions. The SNAP program, which assists nearly 42 million Americans, including seniors, people with disabilities, and families with children, is crucial for food security. While some states are providing temporary funding, the long-term impact of budget cuts and new eligibility rules remains uncertain. The "grocery buddy" initiative highlights the generosity and community spirit in response to widespread need, with participants finding that those receiving help are also eager to offer support in return. This informal network aims to bridge the gap until benefits are restored, demonstrating a powerful collective effort to combat hunger.
