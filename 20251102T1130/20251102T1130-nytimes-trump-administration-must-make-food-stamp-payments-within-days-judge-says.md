## Article summary
A federal court has ordered the Trump administration to make food stamp payments within days, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The order came after a judge ruled that the administration must continue funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which serves about 42 million people. The judge gave the administration a choice: make full payments by Monday or partial payments by Wednesday to avoid hardship for low-income Americans. This ruling highlights the uncertainty surrounding SNAP benefits, as recipients are unsure when they will receive their next payment. President Trump had previously suggested that food stamp aid would be delayed in November until he received legal direction. The initial court order mandated the use of an existing emergency reserve to fund SNAP, but this reserve is insufficient to cover full monthly benefits. Officials warned that using the reserve could lead to benefit cuts and payment delays due to technical issues. To address these concerns, the judge clarified his ruling, offering a timeline for partial payments and encouraging the exploration of alternative funding sources. The administration was urged to use tariff revenue, previously used for another nutrition program, to expedite and potentially cover full SNAP payments. It remains uncertain how the administration will respond, with the Justice Department hinting at the possibility of an appeal.
