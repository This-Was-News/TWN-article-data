## Article summary
The article discusses the shifting dynamics in the U.S. Senate regarding government shutdowns, highlighting that Democrats are less likely to capitulate quickly this time compared to their response in 2018. The ideological makeup of both parties has changed, with Democrats moving left and Republicans moving right, reducing the pressure for Democrats to compromise. Democrats believe they have a strong message on health care, particularly regarding the Affordable Care Act subsidies, and are prepared for an extended confrontation. They view temporary spending extensions as futile due to the administration's unilateral spending practices. Senate Republicans, now more conservative, are less inclined to compromise. Democrats face pressure from their base to hold firm, while Republicans aim to politically damage Democrats by blaming them for the shutdown. The outcome remains uncertain, with past shutdowns showing few winners as public dissatisfaction grows.
