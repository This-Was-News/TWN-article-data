## Article summary
A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll reveals that 30% of Americans now believe political violence may be necessary to right the country, an increase from 11 points since April 2024, driven by Democrats. While 70% disagree, concerns about political violence are high, with 77% describing it as a major concern. The poll also shows a sharp political divide on who is more concerning: 70% of Democrats are more worried about violence toward protesters, while 74% of Republicans are more concerned about violence toward public officials. The survey, conducted with over 1,400 people, indicates that 62% believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, a sentiment that has reversed significantly for Republicans since Donald Trump became president. Additionally, 79% think the country has gone too far in restricting speech, and most believe the Supreme Court should define unacceptable speech. There is also a partisan split on the deployment of the National Guard to reduce crime, with 89% of Republicans in favor and three-quarters of Democrats opposed. The poll further shows strong support for childhood vaccinations and a divide on the importance of controlling gun violence versus protecting gun rights, with Democrats and independents prioritizing gun control, while Republicans prioritize gun rights.
