## Article summary
The U.S. government has shut down after Congress failed to reach a funding agreement. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate could not agree on two funding bills. Democrats wanted to extend healthcare subsidies, while Republicans proposed a short-term measure. Both bills failed to get the required 60 votes. The shutdown will affect nonessential federal jobs and services, with about 750,000 employees potentially furloughed. Critical services like Social Security and Medicare will continue but may face delays. President Trump hinted at possible mass firings and program eliminations. Democrats accuse Republicans of risking healthcare, while Republicans blame Democrats for holding the budget hostage. Some Democrats have started to support the Republican bill, but the shutdown's duration remains unclear.
