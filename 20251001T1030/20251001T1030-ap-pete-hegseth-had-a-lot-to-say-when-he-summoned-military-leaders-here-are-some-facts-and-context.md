## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth outlined significant changes to military policy during a speech at Quantico, Virginia. He criticized promotions based on race, gender, and historic firsts, advocating for a return to a warrior ethos and peace through strength. Hegseth proposed reverting physical standards for combat roles to pre-2015 levels, aiming for gender-neutral high standards. He emphasized that women could serve if they met these standards. Hegseth also questioned recent changes to military standards, asking if they were necessary or driven by other priorities. He addressed the issue of overweight service members, noting it as a significant disqualifier for potential recruits. Hegseth's remarks highlighted his focus on combat effectiveness and his opposition to what he termed a woke culture. He announced changes in handling complaints, personnel records, and promotions. Since taking office, Hegseth has made significant cuts to the top military ranks, including firing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Navy's top officer. Critics argue that the military is already well-trained and effective, questioning the need for such changes.
