## Article summary
A flotilla of activists is attempting to break Israel's blockade of Gaza, carrying humanitarian aid and aiming to draw attention to the plight of Palestinians. The flotilla, consisting of about 50 small vessels with 500 activists from various countries, has faced harassment by an Israeli warship. Spain and Italy initially sent navy ships to escort the flotilla but later urged activists to turn back. The flotilla includes notable figures like Greta Thunberg and Mandla Mandela. Organizers report drone attacks and communication jamming, but no casualties. Israel accuses the flotilla of provocation and links to Hamas, which activists deny. The blockade, justified by Israel as a measure against arms smuggling, is criticized as collective punishment. The U.N. and EU have called for respecting international law and freedom of navigation. Previous attempts to break the blockade have faced similar interruptions, including a deadly raid in 2010. The ongoing war in Gaza has caused a severe humanitarian crisis, with famine declared in the largest city.
