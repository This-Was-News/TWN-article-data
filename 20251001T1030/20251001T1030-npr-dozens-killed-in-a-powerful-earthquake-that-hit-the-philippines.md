## Article summary
A powerful magnitude-6.9 earthquake struck the central Philippines on Tuesday night, killing at least 69 people and causing widespread damage. The epicenter was near Bogo City in Cebu province, where half of the deaths were reported. Rescue efforts were hampered by rain, damaged infrastructure, and landslides. The earthquake, caused by an undersea fault line, triggered a brief tsunami warning that was later lifted. Many residents refused to return home, opting to stay in open areas due to fear of aftershocks. The region was still recovering from a tropical storm that had recently caused significant damage and loss of life. The Philippine government is assessing the situation and may seek international aid. Foreign governments, including the U.S., Japan, Australia, and the EU, have expressed condolences and offered support. The earthquake was one of the most powerful in the region in over a decade, striking while many were asleep or at home. The Philippines, located on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' is prone to such natural disasters, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and typhoons.
