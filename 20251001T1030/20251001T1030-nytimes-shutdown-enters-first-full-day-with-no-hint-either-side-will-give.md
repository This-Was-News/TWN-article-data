## Article summary
The U.S. government has shut down due to a spending deadlock between President Trump and Democrats in Congress. The shutdown began at midnight, disrupting federal services and potentially leading to mass layoffs. The dispute centers on Democrats' demands for the president to extend expiring health care subsidies and restore Medicaid cuts. Both parties blocked each other's spending proposals, making the shutdown inevitable. Senate Republicans and Democrats engaged in a bitter standoff, with each party blaming the other for the crisis. President Trump threatened to use the shutdown to enact measures harmful to Democrats, including laying off federal workers. Democrats, however, remained resolute, accusing Republicans of prioritizing political gains over the well-being of Americans. The shutdown could result in millions losing health coverage and increased insurance premiums. Despite the crisis, negotiations seemed unlikely, with both sides entrenched in their positions. The political tension was further exacerbated by President Trump's controversial AI-generated video mocking Democratic leaders. The shutdown highlights the deep ideological divide between the two parties, with no immediate resolution in sight.
