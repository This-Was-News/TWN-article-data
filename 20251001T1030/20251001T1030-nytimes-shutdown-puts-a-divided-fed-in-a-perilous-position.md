## Article summary
The Federal Reserve faces a challenging decision on interest rate cuts, complicated by a government shutdown that threatens to withhold crucial economic data. Key reports like the jobs report and Consumer Price Index are at risk, leaving policymakers with an unclear view of the economy. The Fed is divided, with some advocating for quick rate cuts and others urging caution. The shutdown could further strain the economy, with estimates suggesting each week of closure could reduce economic output. Inflation remains a concern, driven by tariffs, but many officials expect these pressures to fade. Fed Chair Jerome Powell supports gradual rate cuts, viewing them as insurance against labor market risks. However, new board member Stephen Miran argues for more aggressive cuts, warning of potential job losses. Others, like Vincent Reinhart, believe the economy is stable and not in immediate danger. The debate highlights differing views on the neutral interest rate and the impact of recent policies. Policymakers stress the need for caution to avoid overstimulating the economy. The shutdown complicates efforts to gather evidence for further rate cuts, making the Fed's task even more difficult.
