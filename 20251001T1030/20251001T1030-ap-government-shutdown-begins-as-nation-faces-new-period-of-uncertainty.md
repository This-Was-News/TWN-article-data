## Article summary
The U.S. government has shut down due to a failure between President Donald Trump and Congress to agree on funding, leading to uncertainty and economic fallout. Approximately 750,000 federal workers are expected to be furloughed or potentially fired, with offices possibly closing permanently. Trump's deportation agenda will proceed, while services like education and environmental programs may suffer. The economic impact is expected to be widespread, affecting benefit payments, work contracts, and various services. Democrats are demanding funding for health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans refuse to negotiate. The shutdown highlights political divisions and the lack of compromise between parties. The situation is a test for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Mike Johnson, with both sides blaming the other for the impasse. The standoff could lead to a prolonged closure, with significant consequences for Americans relying on government services.
