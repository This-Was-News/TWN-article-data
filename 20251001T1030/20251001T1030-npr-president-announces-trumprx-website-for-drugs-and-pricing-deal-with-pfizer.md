## Article summary
President Trump announced a deal with Pfizer to sell its drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices through a new website called TrumpRx.gov. The initiative aims to align U.S. drug prices with those in other developed countries, known as most-favored-nation pricing. Pfizer agreed to charge the same price for new drugs in the U.S. as in other developed countries. The website is expected to launch in 2026 and will offer Pfizer drugs at 50% lower prices on average. However, details on how the discounts were calculated remain confidential. The deal is part of a broader effort to lower drug prices, following an executive order in May. The Trump administration sent letters to 17 drug companies demanding lower prices and direct-to-consumer sales. Pfizer's CEO praised the deal, pledging to launch new drugs at the same price globally and to offer drugs to Medicaid at most-favored-nation pricing. Critics argue that the deal may not significantly benefit average consumers or Medicaid beneficiaries. The administration also threatened tariffs to motivate drug companies to comply with pricing demands.
