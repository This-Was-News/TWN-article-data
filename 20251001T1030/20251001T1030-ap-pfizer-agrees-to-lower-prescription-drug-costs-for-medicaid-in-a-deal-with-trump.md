## Article summary
Pfizer has agreed to lower prescription drug costs for Medicaid under a deal with the Trump administration, with President Donald Trump announcing the agreement at the White House. Pfizer, a major U.S. drugmaker, will charge Medicaid the lowest price offered in other developed nations and participate in a new website called TrumpRx, offering discounts averaging 50%. The deal follows an executive order by Trump, setting a deadline for drugmakers to lower prices or face limits on government payments. Pfizer also committed to spending $70 billion on domestic manufacturing facilities. Trump threatened tariffs to persuade companies to strike deals, though the extent of pricing changes remains unclear. Lower drug prices could help state budgets and uninsured patients, but discounts may still leave some paying hundreds monthly. Pfizer's participation in the TrumpRx website aims to connect customers directly with products, though experts note this will help only a small number of people. Democrats are pushing to reverse Medicaid cuts in a government funding measure, while Republicans refuse to negotiate.
