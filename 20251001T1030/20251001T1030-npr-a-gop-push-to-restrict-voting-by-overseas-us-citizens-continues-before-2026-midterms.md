## Article summary
A push by Republican officials to restrict voting rights for U.S. citizens living abroad, including military members, is gaining momentum ahead of the 2026 midterms. Around 2.8 million U.S. expatriates were eligible to vote in 2022, but their turnout is significantly lower than domestic voters. Advocates fear that GOP-led lawsuits and proposals could further suppress participation. The focus is on overseas citizens who were born abroad and have never lived in the U.S., with some states allowing them to vote in federal, state, and local elections. Recent legal challenges in Michigan and North Carolina have led to restrictions, such as barring non-resident voters in North Carolina from voting in state and local races. The Republican National Committee is also challenging voting laws in Arizona. Nationwide, a House bill, the PROVE Act, aims to require overseas voters to have a current residence in their registered state. Advocates argue that these efforts are politically motivated and could disenfranchise many voters. Meanwhile, election officials note a demographic shift with civilians outnumbering military members among registered overseas voters. The GOP admits a partisan motive, claiming that allowing non-resident voters adds individuals disproportionately non-Republican to voter rolls. Despite no evidence of widespread fraud, some Republican officials are pushing for additional voter registration requirements. Trump's executive order on voter eligibility has faced legal challenges, with advocates arguing it adds unnecessary burdens to an already difficult voting process for overseas citizens.
