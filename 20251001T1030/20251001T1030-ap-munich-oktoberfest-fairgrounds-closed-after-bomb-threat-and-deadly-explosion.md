## Article summary
The Munich Oktoberfest fairgrounds were closed Wednesday morning due to a bomb threat from the suspected perpetrator of an explosion in northern Munich. The explosion at a residential building early Wednesday is believed to have caused at least one death, linked to a domestic dispute. The deceased's identity remains unclear, and another person is missing but not considered a public danger. Police discovered the bomb threat in a letter from the alleged perpetrator and searched the fairgrounds for explosive devices. The festival, which began on Sept. 20 and ends Oct. 5, attracts up to 6 million visitors annually. In 1980, Oktoberfest was the site of a deadly neo-Nazi attack that killed 13 people and injured over 200. Specialized teams were called to defuse booby traps in the building, and photos showed a burned-out van. Authorities have closed the festival until at least 5 p.m. local time (1500 GMT) Wednesday.
