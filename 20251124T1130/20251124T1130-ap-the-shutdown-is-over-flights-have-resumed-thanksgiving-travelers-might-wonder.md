## Article summary
Thanksgiving travelers can expect a busy travel week following a recent government shutdown that caused flight disruptions. While the shutdown's impact on air travel is largely over, experts advise preparing for typical holiday travel challenges like winter weather, heavy traffic, and crowded airports. The Federal Aviation Administration anticipates its busiest Thanksgiving week in 15 years, with millions of passengers and a significant increase in road travel projected by AAA. Travelers are encouraged to check weather forecasts frequently, pack smart by unpacking and leaving gifts unwrapped, and ensure they have the necessary identification for flights, including REAL ID or a mobile ID option. For road trips, AAA recommends pre-trip vehicle checks and starting journeys early to avoid traffic, which is expected to be heaviest on Wednesday afternoon and Thanksgiving Day. Passengers are urged to download airline apps for real-time flight status updates and to leave for their destinations earlier than usual to reduce stress. By being informed and prepared, travelers can navigate the holiday rush more smoothly, regardless of lingering anxieties from the shutdown.
