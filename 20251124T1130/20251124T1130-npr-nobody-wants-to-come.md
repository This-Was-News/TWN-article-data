## Article summary
The United States heavily relies on immigrant physicians, who constitute about a quarter of all doctors in the country, with even higher percentages in rural areas and certain specialties like oncology. However, new policies are making the U.S. a less appealing destination for foreign-born medical professionals. Recent actions, such as significant hikes in H1B visa fees and cuts to scientific research, have caused foreign-born doctors to question their future in the U.S. and consider returning to their home countries or seeking opportunities elsewhere. This trend is concerning as it could exacerbate existing healthcare worker shortages, particularly in underserved communities. Many experts believe these policies risk undoing decades of progress in building a strong healthcare system. Other countries are actively recruiting international medical talent, further challenging the U.S.'s position. The U.S. has a long history of attracting top global talent, dating back to the 1960s, when immigration laws and increased demand for healthcare services created opportunities. This influx of foreign-born doctors has been crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in health research and practice. The current shift in policy could have long-lasting negative impacts on patient care and the overall healthcare landscape in America.
