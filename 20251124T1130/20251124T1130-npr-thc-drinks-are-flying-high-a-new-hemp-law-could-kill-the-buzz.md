## Article summary
Drinks infused with THC derived from hemp are experiencing a surge in popularity across the United States, becoming widely available even in states where cannabis sales are prohibited. This boom is largely attributed to a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill, which defines hemp as cannabis containing no more than 0.3% Delta-9 THC, allowing for interstate commerce and sales in various retail settings. These beverages, often marketed as alternatives to alcohol, have attracted a new demographic of consumers seeking low-dose THC options. However, this burgeoning market faces an uncertain future due to a recently passed federal law that mandates a one-year deadline to close the hemp loophole and implement new restrictions. Industry experts warn that these changes could have a devastating impact on the multi-billion dollar hemp market. State attorneys general have raised concerns about the potential risks of an unregulated hemp THC market, particularly for children. While some industry leaders advocate for stricter regulations and age-gating, others are pushing for legislative action to repeal the new restrictions. The situation remains fluid, with potential federal actions ranging from standardizing product testing to requiring ID checks for purchases. Despite the looming uncertainty, demand for these hemp-derived THC drinks remains strong, with some businesses scrambling to fulfill large orders before potential new regulations take effect.
