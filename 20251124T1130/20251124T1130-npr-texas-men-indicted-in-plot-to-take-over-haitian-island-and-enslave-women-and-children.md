## Article summary
Two men from North Texas, Gavin Weisenburg, 21, and Tanner Thomas, 20, have been indicted by federal prosecutors for allegedly plotting a violent coup on the Haitian island of Gonave. The indictment claims they planned to murder all men on the island and enslave the women and children. Prosecutors allege Thomas joined the U.S. Air Force in 2025 to gain military training for the coup, while Weisenburg enrolled in a fire academy. The men reportedly researched weapons, took Haitian Creole language training, and planned to transport firearms by sailboat. Weisenburg allegedly attended sailing school in Thailand in preparation. They also allegedly planned to recruit homeless individuals from Washington, D.C., to assist in their plot. Both men have pleaded not guilty, with their attorneys stating the government's claims are misleading. The conspiracy charge carries a potential life sentence, and they also face charges for producing child pornography.
