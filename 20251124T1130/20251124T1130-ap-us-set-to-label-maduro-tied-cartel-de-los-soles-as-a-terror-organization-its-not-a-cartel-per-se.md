## Article summary
The Trump administration is set to designate the Cartel de los Soles, an organization allegedly led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. This move is part of an intensified effort to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The Cartel de los Soles, a term originating in the 1990s referring to corrupt military officers, has evolved to encompass a broader network of officials involved in illegal activities. In 2020, the U.S. Justice Department indicted Maduro and his associates on narcoterrorism charges. Experts note that the Cartel de los Soles is not a traditional cartel with a defined hierarchy but rather an umbrella term for corrupt officials. The Trump administration has previously applied the foreign terrorist organization label to other Latin American criminal groups. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that this designation provides new options for dealing with Maduro. The administration believes Maduro's rule is unsustainable and is exploring various military and non-military actions. The 2020 indictment alleged a conspiracy to traffic cocaine into the U.S. and use the drug trade as a weapon against America. Maduro denies these charges, claiming the U.S. is fabricating a narrative to force him from power. The U.S. Treasury Department previously imposed sanctions on the Cartel de los Soles, alleging its involvement in assisting drug trafficking.
