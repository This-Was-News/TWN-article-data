## Article summary
Colonel Andrei Demurenko, a Russian officer who once studied at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in the early 1990s, volunteered to fight for Russia in Ukraine in 2023. His time in the U.S. was meant to symbolize a new era of cooperation between the two nations, and he formed strong friendships with American officers. Despite these positive experiences, Demurenko returned to Russia and, influenced by Kremlin narratives, came to believe that Ukraine, backed by the West, posed an existential threat to Russia. He re-entered military service at age 67, driven by a sense of duty and a belief in President Putin's leadership. His experiences at the front were brutal, and he was severely injured by a mortar blast. His old American friends were shocked and saddened to learn he was fighting in the war, questioning how their friend had become an adversary. Demurenko, though acknowledging some potential diplomatic failures, does not regret his decision to fight and still hopes for future cooperation between Russia and the West. His story highlights the complex and often tragic trajectory of U.S.-Russian relations.
