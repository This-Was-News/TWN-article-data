## Article summary
Sudan's top general, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, has rejected a U.S.-led ceasefire proposal, deeming it "the worst yet" and unacceptable. This rejection is a significant setback for efforts to end the devastating war that began in April 2023 between the military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict has resulted in over 40,000 deaths, created the world's largest humanitarian crisis with millions displaced, and pushed parts of the country towards famine. The mediators, known as the Quad (U.S., Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE), have been working for over two years to achieve peace. Burhan accused the mediators of bias, particularly criticizing U.S. adviser Massad Boulos and the UAE, which is widely accused of arming the RSF. The rejected proposal reportedly included a three-month humanitarian truce followed by a nine-month political process, to which the RSF had agreed. Burhan stated that the military would only agree to a truce if the RSF completely withdraws from civilian areas. He also denied accusations of the military being controlled by Islamists or using chemical weapons.
