## Article summary
Ukrainian and American officials were set to continue working on a revised peace plan to end the war with Russia following highly productive diplomatic efforts over the weekend. These discussions, held in Geneva, aimed to address concerns from Ukraine and its European allies that an initial draft of the plan, promoted by President Trump, was too favorable to Moscow. A joint statement from the White House and Ukraine's presidency indicated significant progress in aligning positions and the drafting of an updated peace framework. Intensive work on joint proposals is expected to continue in the coming days. European leaders, who participated in the Geneva talks, were also slated to discuss the peace proposal on the sidelines of an EU-African Union summit. However, specific adjustments to the plan remained unclear, particularly regarding contentious points for Ukraine such as territorial concessions, military size limitations, and the exclusion of NATO membership. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Russia's agreement is crucial for the plan's success. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously stated the plan could be a foundation for an agreement but has not commented on the latest talks. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has offered mediation, anticipated speaking with President Putin on Monday.
