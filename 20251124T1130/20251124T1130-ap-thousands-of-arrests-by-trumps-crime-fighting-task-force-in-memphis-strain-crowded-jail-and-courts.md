## Article summary
A task force established by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has resulted in thousands of arrests, significantly straining the local court system and an already overcrowded jail. Since late September, hundreds of law enforcement personnel have conducted traffic stops, served warrants, and apprehended fugitives, leading to over 2,800 arrests and 28,000 traffic citations. While supported by Governor Bill Lee and others aiming to reduce violent crime, the task force has faced criticism from opponents who argue it disproportionately targets minorities and intimidates Latino residents. The increased arrests have led to long waits in traffic court and packed criminal court dockets, causing inmates to wait longer for bail hearings. Shelby County officials are seeking additional judges and emergency funds to manage the growing caseload and jail population, which has seen inmates sleeping in chairs and requiring transfers to other facilities due to overcrowding. The jail has experienced 65 deaths since 2019, raising safety concerns. The district attorney acknowledges that the task force deployment could have benefited from more planning regarding its downstream effects. A task force spokesperson stated that the high volume of arrests demonstrates its effectiveness, while acknowledging the added demands on the criminal justice system. The Federal Bureau of Prisons is making a satellite prison camp available to assist with the overflow.
