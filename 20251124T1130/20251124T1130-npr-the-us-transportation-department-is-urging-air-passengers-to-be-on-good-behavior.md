## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Transportation has launched a "civility campaign" called "The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You" to promote better behavior among air passengers during the busy holiday travel season. The campaign aims to restore courtesy and class to air travel, ensuring a safer experience for everyone on board and on the ground. This initiative comes in response to a significant increase in unruly passenger incidents, with over 13,800 incidents reported since 2021 and a 400% rise in in-flight outbursts since 2019. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is encouraging travelers to consider their actions, such as helping others, dressing respectfully, and thanking flight crews. While 2023 saw a decrease in incidents compared to the pandemic's peak, the FAA anticipates this Thanksgiving holiday to be the busiest for air travel in 15 years. The campaign video contrasts nostalgic images of past air travel with clips of disruptive behavior, emphasizing the need for a return to civility. The DOT believes that improving passenger conduct will not only enhance the travel experience but also contribute to the safety of passengers, gate workers, flight attendants, and pilots.
