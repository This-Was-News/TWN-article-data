## Article summary
A proposed peace plan for Ukraine, led by the United States and involving secret negotiations with Russia, has been met with anguish and disillusionment by many Ukrainians. The plan reportedly includes Ukraine relinquishing territory, reducing its military, and abandoning NATO membership in exchange for security guarantees and reconstruction aid. A key point of contention is the proposed blanket post-war amnesty for Russian forces, which survivors of atrocities in Bucha view as a "green light" for further violence and an erasure of accountability. Residents of Bucha, a Kyiv suburb where hundreds were killed during Russian occupation, are particularly distressed by the amnesty provision, with one woman expressing horror and inviting Trump to witness their pain. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledges the plan as one of the war's most difficult moments and intends to seek changes. European leaders emphasize that peace talks must include Ukraine and protect its sovereignty. The uncertainty surrounding the peace plan casts a shadow of fragility over any promised future for the war-torn nation, with many believing the war will not end soon and that further sacrifices will be made.
