## Article summary
Ukrainian and American officials reported significant progress on Sunday during talks concerning a U.S. proposal to end the war with Russia. Despite this, President Trump criticized Ukraine, calling its leadership ungrateful for American aid. Trump has imposed a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to accept his 28-point peace plan, which an initial draft suggested would concede to Russian demands. The discussions, held in Geneva, aimed to resolve differences, and a joint statement indicated that both Ukraine and the U.S. found the talks productive. The statement emphasized that any agreement must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and ensure a lasting, just peace, leading to a revised peace framework. Both nations committed to further intensive work on joint proposals. A U.S. official noted that the teams were systematically reviewing the plan, making adjustments, and reducing disagreements to find common ground acceptable to both Kyiv and Washington.
