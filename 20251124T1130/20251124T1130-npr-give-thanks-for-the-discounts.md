## Article summary
This Thanksgiving, shoppers can expect to pay less for their holiday feast compared to last year, despite overall grocery prices continuing to rise. Discounts on key items like turkey and stuffing are contributing to this decrease. A surplus of food, particularly corn and soybeans used for feeding turkeys, has significantly lowered the cost of whole frozen turkeys by about 16%. While avian flu initially raised concerns, advance purchasing by grocery chains and promotional pricing have kept turkey costs down. Other items such as stuffing, dinner rolls, and pie crusts are also cheaper due to falling wheat prices. However, sweet potatoes and fresh vegetables may be more expensive due to factors like hurricane damage. Shoppers are finding that the price difference between national brands and store brands has narrowed, making store brands more appealing. Even with these savings, the cost of Thanksgiving staples remains higher than pre-pandemic levels. The article also notes that a beef-centric holiday meal would be considerably more expensive this year.
