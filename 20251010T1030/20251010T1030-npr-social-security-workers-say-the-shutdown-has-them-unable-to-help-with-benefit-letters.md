## Article summary
The government shutdown has left Social Security field office employees unable to provide benefit verification letters, which are crucial for obtaining aid like housing and fuel assistance. While benefits are still being disbursed, in-person support for these letters is suspended, and the automated phone system is often unreliable. Workers report a high volume of calls from recipients needing these letters, including elderly and disabled individuals who struggle with online tools. The shutdown is causing significant stress for both recipients and employees, who are working without pay and dealing with increased workloads due to staff departures. The timing of the shutdown is particularly concerning as open enrollment for fuel assistance begins in colder regions. Employees express frustration and worry about the future of the agency if the shutdown continues.
