## Article summary
New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted in a mortgage fraud case, allegedly pressured by President Donald Trump. James, a Democrat, was charged with bank fraud and making false statements related to a 2020 home purchase in Virginia. The case was presented by a former Trump aide, Lindsey Halligan, who replaced a veteran prosecutor resistant to filing charges. James denounced the indictment as politically motivated, citing Trump's public statements. The indictment follows a similar case against former FBI Director James Comey, also seen as politically driven. James's lawyer argued that the charges are baseless and driven by Trump's desire for revenge. The case involves James allegedly renting out a home she claimed as a second residence, obtaining favorable loan terms. Trump has publicly advocated for charging James, while the Justice Department investigates other figures like Lisa Cook and Adam Schiff. James has been a vocal critic of Trump, winning a significant fraud judgment against him, though it was later overturned. The indictment highlights concerns about the weaponization of the justice system for political purposes.
