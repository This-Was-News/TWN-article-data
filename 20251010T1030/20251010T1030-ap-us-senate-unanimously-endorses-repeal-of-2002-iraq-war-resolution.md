## Article summary
The U.S. Senate has unanimously voted to repeal the 2002 resolution that authorized the Iraq War, following a similar House vote. The repeal, led by Senators Tim Kaine and Todd Young, aims to return war powers to Congress and reinforce Iraq as a strategic partner. The war, which was based on false claims of weapons of mass destruction, resulted in significant casualties. Supporters argue the repeal is crucial to prevent future abuses. The repeal is likely to be included in the final defense authorization bill. However, it is unclear if President Trump will support it. The vote sets an important precedent for Congress's role in ending military conflicts. The bipartisan vote occurred amidst a government shutdown, highlighting Congress's ability to achieve significant outcomes. The 2001 authorization for the global war on terror remains in place.
