## Article summary
Israel has begun pulling back troops from Gaza following a cabinet-approved ceasefire plan to end the two-year-old war. The agreement includes the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israeli forces have started retreating to a buffer zone, with the handover of living hostages expected to begin Monday. The ceasefire, which began upon cabinet approval, has sparked hope among Palestinians to return to their homes. However, some areas like Khan Younis experienced shelling, raising questions about compliance with the agreement. The war, which started with Hamas's 2023 attack, has resulted in significant casualties and regional shifts. The ceasefire leaves unresolved issues such as governance in Gaza, reconstruction, and Hamas's weapons. The U.S. and other countries will contribute troops to support and monitor the ceasefire, with President Trump expected to visit the region. The agreement aims to facilitate the flow of food and medicine into Gaza, where famine has been declared due to Israeli restrictions on aid.
