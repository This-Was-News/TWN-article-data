## Article summary
International aid groups are preparing to increase aid delivery to Gaza following a new Israel-Hamas cease-fire agreement. The deal includes provisions for more aid and the reopening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Aid organizations are ready to send supplies but are awaiting clarity on what will be allowed. The agreement stipulates aid delivery terms similar to a previous cease-fire in January, with 600 trucks expected to enter daily. Gaza is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with widespread hunger, destruction, and displacement. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has enough supplies to fill 6,000 trucks and is ready to deliver aid once given the go-ahead. The territory's humanitarian situation has worsened due to the war, with food and aid supplies severely curtailed. Aid groups are hopeful that the cease-fire will allow them to provide much-needed relief to the people of Gaza.
