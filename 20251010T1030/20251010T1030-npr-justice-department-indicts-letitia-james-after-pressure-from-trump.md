## Article summary
A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The charges follow pressure from President Trump, who has been a vocal critic of James after she sued him and his company for business fraud, resulting in a $450 million penalty later overturned on appeal. The indictment alleges James lied on her mortgage application for a property in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020, claiming it would be a secondary residence but instead renting it out, thereby gaining $18,933 in benefits. James denies the charges, calling them baseless and accusing Trump of weaponizing the justice system. The case has seen significant changes, including the replacement of a career prosecutor who found insufficient evidence with a Trump-appointed prosecutor. James's legal team criticizes the case as politically motivated, citing Trump's public calls for her prosecution. James is scheduled for an initial court appearance on October 24.
