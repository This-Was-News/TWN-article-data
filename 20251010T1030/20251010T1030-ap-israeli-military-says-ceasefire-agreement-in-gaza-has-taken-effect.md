## Article summary
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas for the Gaza Strip came into effect at noon local time, with Israeli troops withdrawing to agreed-upon lines. The Israeli Cabinet approved President Donald Trump's plan for the ceasefire, hostage release, and Palestinian prisoner release. Tens of thousands of Palestinians began moving north after the announcement, despite heavy shelling earlier. The ceasefire marks a significant step toward ending a two-year war that has destabilized the Middle East. Israeli forces will control around 50% of Gaza in their new positions. Gaza residents reported intensified shelling throughout the morning, with low-flying military aircraft over central Gaza. A Hamas official outlined the ceasefire deal, including the release of Palestinian prisoners and the opening of the border crossing with Egypt. U.S. officials announced plans to send about 200 troops to Israel to support and monitor the ceasefire deal. The ceasefire agreement aims to end the war and aggression against the Palestinian people, according to a senior Hamas official.
