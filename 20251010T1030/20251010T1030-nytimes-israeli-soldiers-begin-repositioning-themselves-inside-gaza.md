## Article summary
Israel has declared a cease-fire in Gaza, effective from noon on Friday, with its military repositioning within the region. The cease-fire follows an approved deal between Israel and Hamas for the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The Israeli military will allow Palestinians in southern Gaza to travel along major roads to the north but has warned against approaching certain dangerous areas where Israeli troops remain active. The deal includes an initial pullback by the Israeli military and the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences, along with 1,722 Gazans detained during the war. Hamas has 72 hours to return all hostages, including the bodies of those who have died. The situation on the ground in Gaza remains unclear. The Israeli military struck a site in northern Gaza on Thursday night, which it claimed was used by Hamas fighters. The site was reportedly a residential building with dozens of people inside at the time of the strike. The cease-fire and hostage release deal are part of a broader effort to de-escalate tensions and secure the safe return of captives.
