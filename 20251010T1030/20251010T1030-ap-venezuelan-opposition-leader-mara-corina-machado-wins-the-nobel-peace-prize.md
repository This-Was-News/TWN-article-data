## Article summary
Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has won the Nobel Peace Prize for her role in advocating for democracy amidst political turmoil. Machado, a key figure in the opposition to President Nicolás Maduro, has been living in hiding due to threats against her life. Despite this, she has remained in Venezuela, inspiring millions. The Nobel committee praised her courage and resistance against authoritarianism. Machado's ally, Edmundo González, celebrated her win, calling it a recognition of her long fight for freedom and democracy. Maduro's government has targeted opponents, leading to widespread repression and human rights violations. Machado was disqualified from running against Maduro, and González took her place in the election. The election results sparked protests and a diplomatic fallout. Machado becomes the 20th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. The committee emphasized that their decision was based solely on the work and will of Alfred Nobel, not influenced by external campaigns. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway, while other Nobel Prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden.
