## Article summary
The White House and ICE have claimed a 'more than 1,000 percent' rise in assaults on ICE agents, but data analysis shows a much smaller increase. Court records indicate a 25 percent rise in assault charges against federal officers, not the dramatic spike claimed. While ICE agents face dangerous conditions and some serious incidents have occurred, the data does not support the administration's claims. The Department of Homeland Security has not provided evidence to back up its statistics. Charges for assault on federal officers have increased, particularly in areas with large-scale ICE operations and protests. However, many cases do not result in convictions, and some charges are dismissed or reduced. Former law enforcement officials and attorneys criticize the exaggeration of assault statistics, stating it undermines public trust. The data shows that other federal jobs, such as those in the Bureau of Prisons and Bureau of Indian Affairs, are more perilous in Colorado. The credibility of federal law enforcement is questioned when statistics are exaggerated or facts are distorted.
