## Article summary
Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her relentless advocacy for democratic rights in Venezuela. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her work as an extraordinary example of civilian courage in Latin America. Machado, a former legislator, has faced significant persecution, including being banned from running for office and forced into hiding by President Nicolás Maduro's government. She has been a vocal critic of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) since the late 1990s. Despite these challenges, Machado remains committed to her cause, expressing confidence in the Venezuelan people's ability to liberate their country. She described Maduro as weaker than ever and emphasized her continued support for the people of Venezuela. The announcement highlights her resilience and dedication to democratic principles.
