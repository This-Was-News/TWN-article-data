## Article summary
Peru's Congress voted to remove President Dina Boluarte from office early Friday, replacing her with Congress leader José Jerí. The impeachment followed a crime wave and a shooting at a concert in Lima. Lawmakers cited Boluarte's inability to control crime as the reason for her removal. Boluarte, Peru's first female president, took office in December 2022 after her predecessor was impeached. She faced over 500 protests demanding her resignation in her first three months. Scandals and rising crime rates plagued her administration. Boluarte partially blamed illegal immigration for the crime surge. Official figures show a significant increase in homicides and extortion complaints. Jerí, the new interim president, pledged to defend Peru's sovereignty and hand over power after the April election. Boluarte's removal marks the sixth presidential change in Peru in under a decade.
