## Article summary
President Trump has abandoned efforts to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Chicago, and Los Angeles, following legal challenges and a Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge blocked the administration's move to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for migrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua, citing discriminatory intent. The administration has also faced setbacks in its attempts to control California National Guard troops and has been accused of political retaliation through vetoes of water and land bills impacting Colorado and Florida.

In Venezuela, several Americans have been detained amidst escalating U.S. pressure, complicating diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, NASA is closing its largest research library, sparking concerns about the loss of historical and scientific information. The Justice Department is seeking hundreds of lawyers to review millions of pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents. Additionally, the Health and Human Services Department has paused child care funding to Minnesota due to a fraud scandal, and internal emails suggest senior Justice Department officials played a role in charging an immigrant who was wrongfully deported. Finally, Mali and Burkina Faso have imposed travel bans on Americans in response to U.S. restrictions.
