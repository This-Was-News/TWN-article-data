## Article summary
Former special counsel Jack Smith's deposition before the House Judiciary Committee has revealed new details about his investigations into former President Donald Trump. Smith defended his decisions to prosecute Trump on charges related to classified documents and efforts to challenge the 2020 election, asserting that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Republicans focused on Smith's approval of secret subpoenas for phone records of GOP lawmakers, with Smith acknowledging that judges who authorized these subpoenas were not informed that they targeted members of Congress. He argued that this secrecy was necessary to prevent obstruction of justice, despite concerns raised about potential violations of the Speech or Debate Clause. Smith also expressed reservations about the strength of Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony in the election interference case, citing its reliance on hearsay. He denied that his work was politically motivated, stating he followed the facts and the law. The release of the deposition transcript and video aims to provide transparency into the special counsel investigation. Separately, a legal battle continues over the release of reports from the classified documents case.
