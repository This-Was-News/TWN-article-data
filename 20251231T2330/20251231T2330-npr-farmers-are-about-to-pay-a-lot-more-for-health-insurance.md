## Article summary
American farmers are facing significant financial challenges, including tariffs, inflation, and falling crop prices. Adding to these pressures, the expiration of federal health care subsidies is making health insurance unaffordable for many. For farmers who rely on the individual marketplace for coverage, premiums are set to quadruple, making it difficult to afford. Farming is inherently dangerous work, with higher rates of work-related deaths and injuries compared to the general population. The financial burden of injuries, coupled with rising medical costs and concerns about mental health, makes access to affordable healthcare crucial. Many farmers are now facing the difficult choice between being uninsured or leaving their farms for jobs that offer health benefits. The unpredictability of farm income also creates anxiety about repaying subsidies if their profits unexpectedly increase. This situation is causing distress and raising concerns about a potential farm crisis reminiscent of the 1980s. Lawmakers are aware of the issue, but solutions to extend subsidies are facing political hurdles.
