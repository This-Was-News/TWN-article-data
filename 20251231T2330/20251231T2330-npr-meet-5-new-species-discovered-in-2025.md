## Article summary
In 2025, scientists discovered five remarkable new species across the globe. An ancient sea cow, *Salwasiren qatarensis*, was identified from fossils in Qatar, highlighting sea cows' historical role as "ecosystem engineers" that supported carbon-storing seagrass beds. High in the Peruvian Andes, a distinct mouse opossum, *Marmosa chachapoya*, was found, underscoring the biodiversity of underexplored mountainous regions. In Northern California, a new genus and species of brown spider, *Siskiyu armilla*, was identified through DNA analysis, revealing significant hidden spider diversity. From the deep sea off California, a captivating "smiley" snailfish, *Careproctus colliculi*, was described, challenging perceptions of the harsh deep-sea environment and emphasizing its ecological importance. Finally, in Tanzania, three new species of toads belonging to the genus *Nectophrynoides* were identified, notable for giving birth to live young, a rare trait among amphibians, and representing a significant loss of evolutionary history as their populations decline.
