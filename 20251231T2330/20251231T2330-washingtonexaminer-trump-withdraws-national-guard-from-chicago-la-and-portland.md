## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of National Guard units from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, despite claims that their presence led to significantly reduced crime. Trump stated on Truth Social that these cities would have been "GONE" without federal intervention and suggested the National Guard might return if crime rates rise again. He criticized the Democratic mayors and governors of these cities for wanting the Guard to leave, questioning their competence given the "great progress" made. This decision follows legal challenges in these cities regarding the National Guard's deployment. In Illinois, the Supreme Court denied a request to lift an order blocking federalization of troops in Chicago. A federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment in Los Angeles, returning control to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Similarly, a federal judge permanently blocked the deployment in Portland, Oregon. While the National Guard is leaving these cities, federal immigration authorities, including Border Patrol, will maintain a presence. The National Guard can remain in Washington, D.C., for now, and is also active in New Orleans following a request from Gov. Jeff Landry.
