## Article summary
Global celebrations marked the arrival of 2026 with a mix of traditional festivities and somber reflections on recent tragedies and ongoing conflicts. Sydney, Australia, featured fireworks and a heightened police presence, emphasizing defiance after a recent mass shooting. In contrast, Indonesia scaled back celebrations due to devastating floods, and Hong Kong opted for a light show instead of fireworks following a fatal apartment fire. Palestinians in Gaza expressed hope for peace and the return of displaced persons in the new year, amidst widespread destruction. Pope Leo XIV urged Rome to welcome foreigners, while European cities planned fireworks displays. New York City implemented additional anti-terrorism measures for its Times Square ball drop. The year also brings reflections on the US's upcoming 250th anniversary and the inauguration of a new mayor in New York City. Meanwhile, other news highlights include Buddhist monks on a peace walk, SNAP food bans, and a former Republican senator's dementia diagnosis.
