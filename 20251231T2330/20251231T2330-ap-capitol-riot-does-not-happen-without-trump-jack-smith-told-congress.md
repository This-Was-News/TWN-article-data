## Article summary
Former special counsel Jack Smith testified to Congress that the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot would not have occurred without Donald Trump, identifying him as the most culpable individual in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith stated that the crimes were committed for Trump's benefit and that the attack on the Capitol was a direct consequence of his actions. He rejected the notion that his investigations were politically motivated, emphasizing that the evidence clearly pointed to Trump's responsibility. Smith highlighted that the case was strengthened by the cooperation of Republicans who prioritized the country over the party. He asserted that Trump caused the riot, exploited it, and was aware of his supporters' anger when he directed them to the Capitol. Furthermore, Smith noted that Trump refused to stop the violence and even endangered his vice president with a tweet. Smith defended the lawful acquisition of phone records from GOP lawmakers, stating accountability should lie with Trump for directing his co-conspirators. He also addressed claims about Trump's actions in the presidential SUV, noting discrepancies in witness accounts.
