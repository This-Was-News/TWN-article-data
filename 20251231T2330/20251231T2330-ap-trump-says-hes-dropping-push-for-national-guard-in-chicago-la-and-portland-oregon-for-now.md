## Article summary
President Donald Trump has announced he is dropping his push to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, Oregon, citing legal roadblocks. Trump stated that he might revisit the issue if crime rates increase. Governors typically control National Guard units, and Trump had deployed troops to these cities against the wishes of local Democratic leaders, framing it as a crackdown on immigration, crime, and protests. The president views his tough-on-crime stance as a winning political issue. Troops had already been withdrawn from Los Angeles. Trump claimed the presence of troops was responsible for a drop in crime, although they never patrolled the streets in Chicago and Portland due to legal challenges. Officials in Portland and Chicago attributed crime reduction to local efforts. The Supreme Court had previously refused to allow the deployment in the Chicago area, and a federal judge permanently blocked troop deployment in Portland. Governors of Illinois and Oregon expressed satisfaction with Trump being forced to stand down. The deployment in Los Angeles faced legal challenges, with control eventually returning to the state. However, troops will remain in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, where deployments are supported by state leadership or have been allowed to continue during appeals. In New Orleans, National Guard troops deployed by Trump are set to remain through Mardi Gras with the support of state and local officials.
