## Article summary
The Center Square is investigating potential fraud in Washington State's taxpayer-subsidized childcare centers, with reports of facilities receiving substantial government funding but appearing to have no children present. This investigation follows a similar "massive" federal probe into Somali-run facilities in Minnesota. Several daycare centers in Federal Way, WA, including Eyow Childcare Inc., Brightstar Early Learning, and Halimo Daycare, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in subsidies between July and November 2025. Journalists attempting to question operators at these facilities were met with hostility, police involvement, or refusal to answer questions. State Representative Jim Walsh expressed concern, drawing parallels to Minnesota's situation and suggesting stricter financial reporting requirements for organizations receiving state grants, similar to those for political campaigns. The Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF) has stated they will investigate the questionable locations. While some comments suggest the empty facilities might be due to the holiday period, others claim daycares are busier then. The investigation aims to uncover potential misuse of taxpayer funds intended for childcare subsidies.
