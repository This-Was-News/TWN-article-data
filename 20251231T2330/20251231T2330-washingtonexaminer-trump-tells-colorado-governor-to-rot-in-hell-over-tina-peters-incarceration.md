## Article summary
Donald Trump has publicly condemned Colorado Governor Jared Polis and District Attorney Daniel Rubinstein, wishing them to "rot in Hell" for the incarceration of Tina Peters, a former Colorado election clerk. Peters was sentenced to nine years in prison for tampering with voting equipment in an attempt to prove unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. Trump, who had previously issued a symbolic pardon to Peters, reiterated his belief that she was unfairly imprisoned due to her age and health. He criticized the state's election system, suggesting it disadvantages Republicans. Governor Polis responded by stating that presidential pardons do not apply to state charges and urged Trump to focus on domestic issues. District Attorney Rubinstein criticized Trump's statement as lacking factual or legal basis, suggesting it was an attempt to regain attention. Peters' legal team is pursuing an appeal of her conviction, arguing that Trump's pardon should affect the case. The Colorado appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments on her case in January 2026.
