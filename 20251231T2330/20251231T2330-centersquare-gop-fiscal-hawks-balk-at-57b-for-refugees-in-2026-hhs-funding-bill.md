## Article summary
GOP fiscal conservatives are expressing strong opposition to a proposed $5.7 billion allocation for refugee assistance within the 2026 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding bill. While this amount is slightly less than the funding provided in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, it represents a threefold increase compared to pre-2021 levels. Senators Mike Lee and Rand Paul have publicly stated their intention to vote against the bill due to this funding. Congressional funding for Refugee and Entrant Assistance (REA) programs, which offer medical, employment, and cash support to refugees, was $1.91 billion in fiscal year 2021. This figure surged to $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2022 and has remained over $6 billion annually since then, due to continuing resolutions in lieu of a fiscal year 2025 budget. Senate Majority Leader John Thune plans to bring a five-bill appropriations package, including the Labor-HHS bill, to a vote upon Congress's return. Failure to pass these appropriations bills by February 1st, the expiration date of the current continuing resolution, could lead to a partial government shutdown. The proposed minibus also includes funding for the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science, and the Interior.
