## Article summary
President Trump has issued his first vetoes of his second term, rejecting two bills that had passed Congress with bipartisan support. These bills aimed to fund a water pipeline in Colorado and expand land for the Miccosukee Tribe in Florida, while also directing aid for flood mitigation. Trump cited taxpayer savings as his reason for the vetoes, but lawmakers accuse him of retaliation due to political disagreements. Specifically, the veto of the Miccosukee Tribe bill is linked to their opposition to his immigration agenda, including a lawsuit against an immigrant detention center. The Colorado bill, sponsored by Representative Lauren Boebert, faced opposition from Trump due to his issues with state leaders over the imprisonment of Tina Peters, who interfered with 2020 election machines. Boebert criticized the veto, stating it denies clean drinking water to thousands and expressed hope it wasn't political retaliation. Senator Michael Bennet echoed these sentiments, calling the vetoes a "revenge tour." Both vetoed pieces of legislation passed Congress with strong bipartisan support, indicating a potential attempt by lawmakers to override the president's decision, a process requiring a two-thirds majority in both chambers.
