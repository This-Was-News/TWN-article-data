## Article summary
2025 was a tumultuous year across the Southwest, marked by devastating wildfires, civil unrest, and significant legal and political battles. In California, the Palisades and Eaton Fires caused widespread destruction and loss of life, leading to controversy over the Los Angeles Mayor's response and subsequent legal claims by the Fire Chief. A Florida resident was charged with starting the Palisades Fire, while Southern California Edison faced lawsuits for its alleged role in the Eaton Fire. Immigration raids in Southern California led to protests and accusations of mistreatment, with the state filing numerous lawsuits against the federal administration. California also redrew congressional districts via Proposition 50, sparking a legal challenge over alleged racial gerrymandering. In Arizona, a budget agreement averted a state government shutdown, but the Dragon Bravo Fire impacted the Grand Canyon. Political tensions arose regarding Luke Air Force Base and U.S. Senator Mark Kelly's stance on military orders. The year also saw the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk. Nevada's gambling industry and tourism declined, and a cyberattack disrupted state government websites. Lt. Governor Stavros Anthony's bills were blocked, ending the Office of Small Business Advocacy. The state's gubernatorial race remained tightly contested, and a proposed tax incentives bill for a new movie studio failed to pass the Senate.
