## Article summary
A massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia has left families in crisis. Nearly 500 workers were detained, with a majority being Korean and subsequently returned to South Korea. Non-Korean immigrants remain in legal limbo or are unaccounted for. Advocates report that some detained workers had legal authorization to work in the U.S. The raid has caused significant distress, with families struggling to find basic necessities and legal assistance. The financial impact is compounded by the closure of another major employer in the area. Many detained workers were the sole breadwinners in their households. The raid has raised questions about the criteria used for detentions and the broader implications of immigration enforcement policies under the current administration.
