## Article summary
Sean Astin, known for his roles in 'Lord of the Rings,' 'Stranger Things,' and 'Rudy,' has been elected as the new president of SAG-AFTRA, the union representing over 160,000 entertainment professionals. He succeeded Fran Drescher, winning the election with 79% of the vote against Chuck Slavin. Michelle Hurd was elected as secretary-treasurer. Astin is the son of late Academy Award-winning actress Patty Duke and John Astin, known for 'The Addams Family.' Patty Duke previously served as the Screen Actors Guild's president from 1985 to 1988. SAG-AFTRA, formed by the merger of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, represents a wide range of professionals, including actors, journalists, and recording artists. Under Drescher's leadership, the union navigated strikes involving film and television actors, as well as video game and interactive media performers. An earlier version of the story incorrectly spelled Patty Duke's first name.
