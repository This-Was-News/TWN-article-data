## Article summary
The assassination of Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist, has left America at a polarized moment, similar to the aftermath of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in 1968. Kirk's legacy is viewed differently by the right, who see him as an inspiration, and the left, who criticize him for his views on civil rights, transgender rights, feminism, and Islam. Historians and scholars emphasize that the lessons from this time depend on what kind of nation Americans want to be. The murder has sparked anger and fear, with President Trump blaming the left and Democrats and Republicans in Congress lashing out at each other. Governor Spencer Cox of Utah has called for unity, emphasizing that the attack is on all of them. Kirk's views were controversial, but he was a popular figure among young conservatives. The assassination has raised questions about political violence and the importance of free speech. Despite the vitriol, some remain optimistic about America's rejection of political violence and the opportunity for young people to build a different culture.
