## Article summary
The article reveals how U.S. technology companies have significantly contributed to China's extensive surveillance and mass detention systems. The Yang family, farmers in rural China, has been trapped in this digital cage, monitored through their transactions, communications, and movements. The article details how American firms like IBM, Dell, and others designed and marketed systems that enabled China's surveillance state, despite warnings from U.S. Congress and media. These technologies have been used to target and detain individuals like the Yangs, who are simply seeking justice for land seizures. The surveillance apparatus, powered by U.S. tech, has led to human rights abuses, including the detention of millions in Xinjiang. The article highlights the role of predictive policing and AI-driven surveillance in China's crackdown on dissent, raising ethical and legal concerns about the complicity of American tech companies.
