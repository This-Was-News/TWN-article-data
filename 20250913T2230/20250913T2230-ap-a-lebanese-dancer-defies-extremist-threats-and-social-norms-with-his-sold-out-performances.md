## Article summary
Alexandre Paulkevtch, a Lebanese dancer, defied extremist threats and social norms with his sold-out performances in Beirut. Dressed in a white dress and makeup, he performed to a cheering crowd despite threats from fundamentalist groups like the Christian Soldiers of God and Sunni Islamists. Paulkevtch argues he is reviving dance forms common for men in the early 20th century, not promoting homosexuality. Lebanon, relatively tolerant of LGBTQ+ rights, still faces restrictions and violence. Paulkevtch, a long-time activist, sees dance as resistance. His performance at Metro al-Madna, a venue accessible to the LGBTQ+ community, was protected by extra police. Despite Lebanon's economic and political crises, Paulkevtch refuses to stop performing, viewing his art as a political act. He advocates for respect and acceptance, despite facing detention and attacks. Paulkevtch remains optimistic about the future of queer rights and artistic expression in Lebanon.
