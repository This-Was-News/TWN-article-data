## Article summary
Naasón Joaquín García, the leader of the La Luz del Mundo megachurch, and five other church figures, including his mother, Eva García de Joaquín, have been indicted on federal charges of racketeering, child pornography, and sex trafficking. García, who is already serving a 16-year sentence for state sex abuse charges, was moved to federal custody as the indictment was unsealed. Prosecutors allege that the García family has systematically abused followers across generations, with some victims as young as 13. The indictment also claims that the church leaders engaged in international sex trafficking and used their religious influence to intimidate victims. Authorities seized over $1 million in cash and valuable items from the family's homes in Los Angeles. The church, which claims over 6 million followers worldwide, has been accused of operating a network of abuse and financial exploitation. García's defense attorney denies the charges, calling them unfounded. The case is ongoing, with prosecutors seeking the forfeiture of multiple properties linked to the church.
