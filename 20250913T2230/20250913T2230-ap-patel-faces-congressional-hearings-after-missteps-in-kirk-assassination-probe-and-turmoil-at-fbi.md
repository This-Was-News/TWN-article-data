## Article summary
FBI Director Kash Patel faces congressional hearings following missteps in the investigation of conservative activist Charles Kirk's assassination and turmoil within the FBI. Patel's leadership is under scrutiny after falsely claiming the shooter was in custody, leading to public confusion and criticism. Democrats plan to question Patel about the purge of senior executives, his pursuit of former President Donald Trump's grievances, and a realignment of FBI resources towards illegal immigration and street crime. Republicans are expected to defend Patel or shift focus to the FBI's critics. The hearings are seen as a critical test of Patel's ability to stabilize the FBI amid political fights and internal upheaval. Patel's handling of the Kirk case, including his social media posts and internal communications, has drawn significant attention. Additionally, Patel faces a lawsuit from three senior executives who were fired in an August purge, alleging it was part of a Trump administration retaliation campaign. The FBI has also been entangled in politically charged investigations, such as one into the Trump-Russia probe, which Patel has criticized as politicized. Patel has prioritized street crime and drug trafficking, aligning with Trump's agenda, but critics worry this shift may divert attention from complex threats like public corruption and national security.
