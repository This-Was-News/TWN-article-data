## Article summary
The Energy Department under Secretary Chris Wright has disbanded the controversial Climate Working Group (CWG), which authored a report questioning the scientific consensus on climate change. The report prompted criticism from independent scientists and environmental groups, leading to a lawsuit by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists. Wright stated that the group's purpose was to catalyze scientific and public debate, and with that goal met, the CWG was dissolved. The group consisted of scientists and an economist who often framed global warming as beneficial. Environmental groups argue that the report was created in secrecy and violates federal law, aiming to weaken climate pollution protections. Wright defended the report, praising it for prompting open dialogue. However, most scientists, including Andrew Dessler from Texas A&M University, argue that the debate on climate change has already been settled and that the report's arguments ignore decades of evidence. The case continues, with a hearing scheduled to decide if the report will be included in the EPA's decision on regulating climate pollution.
