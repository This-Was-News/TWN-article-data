## Article summary
Parents should initiate conversations about AI with their children as early as elementary school to ensure they understand the technology before encountering it through peers. Experts emphasize the importance of discussing ethical and responsible AI use, as many teens use AI tools like ChatGPT for homework and mental health support without adult guidance. While AI can bolster learning when used correctly, there are significant risks, including unsafe responses to serious mental health issues. Parents are advised to learn about AI alongside their children, using tools like Google's Quick, Draw! to explain how AI works. They should also teach kids to fact-check AI responses and reinforce that AI can make mistakes. Setting boundaries and having open conversations about AI's benefits and dangers are crucial. Experts recommend co-writing AI rules with children, limiting usage, and prioritizing real-life interactions. Despite the challenges, parents are encouraged to trust that their conversations will make a meaningful impact on their children's understanding of AI.
