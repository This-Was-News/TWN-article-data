## Article summary
The White House began demolishing part of its East Wing on Monday to construct a new $250 million ballroom for President Trump. The demolition, which is visible from a nearby park, involves tearing down the façade and windows of the East Wing, which traditionally houses the first lady's offices. Trump announced the start of construction on social media and mentioned it during a meeting with college baseball champions. The project has moved forward without approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees construction on federal buildings. The White House claims the ballroom will be privately funded and will not interfere with the main mansion. The East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during construction. Trump has stated that the ballroom will be the largest structural change to the White House since the addition of the Truman Balcony in 1948. The ballroom is expected to accommodate 999 people and will be completed before Trump's term ends in January 2029. The White House has yet to disclose information on the donors funding the project.
