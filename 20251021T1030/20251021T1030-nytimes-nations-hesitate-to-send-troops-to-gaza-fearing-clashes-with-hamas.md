## Article summary
The Trump peace plan proposes an international security force in Gaza, but potential contributing countries are hesitant due to safety concerns, mission ambiguity, and the risk of being perceived as occupiers. The fragile cease-fire in Gaza depends on Hamas disarming and an international troop presence maintaining peace as Israel withdraws. Countries like Indonesia, Egypt, Turkey, and Azerbaijan have been discussed as potential contributors, but they are wary of engaging in direct conflict with Hamas or operating in dangerous urban areas. The Biden administration made initial efforts to form such a force, but progress has been slow due to mission clarity issues. Mediators are eager to deploy the force quickly to prevent Hamas from consolidating power. The situation is complicated by Israel's reluctance to allow the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza and the need for a clear pathway to Palestinian statehood. The international community faces significant challenges in stabilizing Gaza and ensuring a lasting peace.
