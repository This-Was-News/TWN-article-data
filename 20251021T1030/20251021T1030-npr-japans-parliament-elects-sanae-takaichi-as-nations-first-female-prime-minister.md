## Article summary
Japan's parliament elected Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister on October 21, 2025. Takaichi, an ultraconservative, was elected after her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) formed a coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. She replaces Shigeru Ishiba, who resigned following a three-month political vacuum after the LDP's election loss in July. Takaichi won 237 votes in the lower house, securing a narrow majority. Her coalition, though short of a parliamentary majority, aims to address economic issues like rising prices. Takaichi's government is expected to pursue hawkish and nationalistic policies, similar to her mentor, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She is not prioritizing gender equality or diversity. Takaichi's diplomatic background is limited, and her coalition's stability is uncertain. The LDP's previous partner, Komeito, left due to scandals and Takaichi's revisionist views on Japan's wartime past.
