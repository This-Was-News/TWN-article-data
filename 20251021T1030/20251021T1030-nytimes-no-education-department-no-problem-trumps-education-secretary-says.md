## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Education is experiencing significant layoffs due to the government shutdown, leaving few workers to enforce special education and civil rights laws. The shutdown provides a glimpse into what a complete closure of the department might look like, with core functions like distributing federal funds and enforcing laws severely impacted. Education Secretary Linda McMahon argues that the shutdown proves the department is unnecessary and that education should be returned to the states. While the federal government has a small role in daily school operations, it is crucial for distributing billions in funding and enforcing federal laws in schools and universities. The shutdown highlights the potential consequences of shutting down the department, including the elimination of research arms tracking student achievement and the reduction of enforcement of key educational laws.
