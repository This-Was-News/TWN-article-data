## Article summary
The Louvre Museum in Paris recently experienced a daring heist where masked thieves stole priceless jewels in broad daylight. The thieves used a lift on a truck to break into the Galerie d'Apollon, smashing display cases and stealing eight items of significant cultural and historical value. The Louvre, originally built as a military fortress in the 12th century, has a rich history as a royal residence and art collection center. It opened as a public museum in 1793, displaying art from the royal collection. The museum has faced multiple high-profile security breaches, including the 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa by Vincenzo Peruggia. The Louvre survived Nazi Germany's occupation during World War II, thanks to efforts by Jacques Jaujard, who evacuated thousands of masterpieces to the French countryside. Postwar, the museum experienced several bold daytime art thefts, including the theft of the sword of King Charles X in 1976. Despite renovations and security upgrades, the Louvre continues to face challenges such as overcrowding, disrepair, and climate change. Recent strikes by staff highlight issues of unmanageable crowds and chronic understaffing, underscoring the need for further improvements in security and infrastructure.
