## Article summary
The prolonged government shutdown poses a significant economic threat, extending beyond missed paychecks to impact federal services crucial to the economy. Unlike past shutdowns, where economic losses were temporary, this one could have lasting effects due to its duration and the lack of appropriations bills passed. The White House's attempts to lay off thousands of workers and withhold back pay could exacerbate the economic impact. Essential services, such as national park tours and drug reviews, are disrupted, affecting businesses, especially as the holiday season approaches. Economists predict the shutdown will reduce annual economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per week, translating to billions of dollars in lost output. The longer the shutdown continues, the greater the indirect impacts on the economy.
