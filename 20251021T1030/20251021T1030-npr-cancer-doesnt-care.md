## Article summary
The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network organized its annual citizen lobby day in Washington, D.C., where over 500 volunteers from across the political spectrum came together to advocate for cancer research and support. Despite political divisions, volunteers like Mary Catherine Johnson and Lexy Mealing, who have personal experiences with breast cancer, united to push Congress to prioritize cancer-related issues. The event occurred amidst a federal government shutdown, highlighting the bipartisan support for cancer research and healthcare subsidies. Volunteers decorated bags with messages of hope and shared personal stories to emphasize the impact of cancer. The day culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, symbolizing unity and hope in the fight against cancer. The volunteers' efforts underscored the importance of bipartisan cooperation in addressing critical health issues, with a focus on increasing funding for cancer research and maintaining insurance subsidies.
