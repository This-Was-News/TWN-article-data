## Article summary
Sanae Takaichi, a prominent ultraconservative figure in Japanese politics, has been elected as Japan's first female prime minister. At 64, she is also the first woman to lead the Liberal Democratic Party, which has dominated Japan's postwar politics. Takaichi admires Margaret Thatcher and supports former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative vision. Known for her hawkish stance on China, she frequently visits the Yasukuni Shrine, which is controversial due to its glorification of Japan's wartime past. Takaichi has a thin diplomatic background but has held key government posts, including minister of economic security and gender equality. She advocates for a stronger military, increased fiscal spending, and tougher immigration policies. Despite her historic role, Takaichi has not prioritized gender equality and has appointed few women to her government. Her policies and views may strain relations with China and South Korea, though she aims to maintain stable ties. Takaichi's personal life includes a past as a drummer in a heavy-metal band and a self-described workaholic.
