## Article summary
As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are meeting with President Donald Trump to show unity, refusing to negotiate with Democrats. Democrats continue to vote against a House-passed bill to reopen the government until Republicans engage on extending healthcare subsidies. Both sides are entrenched, with federal workers missing paychecks and key programs facing funding cutoffs. The White House meeting is unlikely to lead to a bipartisan resolution immediately. Democrats are focused on the upcoming Affordable Care Act enrollment period, while Republicans hint at a longer funding extension if the shutdown persists. Each side believes the other will eventually concede, but the stalemate shows no signs of ending soon.
