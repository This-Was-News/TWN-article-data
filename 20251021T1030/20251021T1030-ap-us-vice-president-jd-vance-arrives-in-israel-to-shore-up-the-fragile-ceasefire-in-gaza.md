## Article summary
U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrived in Israel to bolster the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has faced recent violence and uncertainty. Vance will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and families of hostages. Israel confirmed the release of a hostage's body by Hamas, part of a ceasefire agreement aimed at ending a two-year war. Hamas reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire, while Israel awaits the return of more hostage remains. Recent clashes have resulted in casualties on both sides, with Hamas and Israel trading strikes. Qatar, a key mediator, criticized Israel for ceasefire breaches and settlement expansions. A Gaza health official accused Israel of torturing returned Palestinian bodies, a claim Israel denies. The ceasefire deal involves the release of hostages and prisoners, with ongoing efforts to identify returned bodies.
