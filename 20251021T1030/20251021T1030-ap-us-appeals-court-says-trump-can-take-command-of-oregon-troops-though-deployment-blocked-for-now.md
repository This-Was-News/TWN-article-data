## Article summary
A U.S. appeals court has temporarily allowed President Donald Trump to take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, though he is still barred from deploying them. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower-court ruling that prohibited Trump from federalizing the troops, citing his authority to enforce laws. However, another order preventing deployment remains in effect. The Justice Department is seeking to dissolve this order, arguing that courts should not question the president's deployment decisions. Oregon's Attorney General has criticized the ruling, stating it grants the president unilateral power. Trump's attempts to deploy troops in Democratic-led cities have faced legal challenges, with a judge in California ruling against his deployment in Los Angeles. Protests in Portland have been mostly small, with federal agents using tear gas to disperse crowds. The administration claims troops are needed to protect federal property, while a judge previously rejected these claims as unfounded.
