## Article summary
Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began a 5-year prison sentence for a criminal conspiracy to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya. He was greeted by supporters and his wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, before being taken to La Santé prison in Paris. Sarkozy maintains his innocence and has appealed his conviction, with his lawyers filing an immediate request for his release. He will serve his sentence in solitary confinement, with limited outdoor time and family visits. Sarkozy's journey from the presidential palace to prison has captivated France, with many supporters expressing their dismay at his incarceration. President Emmanuel Macron hosted Sarkozy at the presidential palace last week, emphasizing the independence of the judiciary. Sarkozy, though retired from active politics, remains influential in conservative circles. The Paris court ruled that he would start serving prison time without waiting for his appeal, citing the seriousness of the offense. Sarkozy has expressed his resolve to face prison and continue fighting his case. The court found that Sarkozy used his position to prepare corruption at the highest level, involving funds from Libya.
