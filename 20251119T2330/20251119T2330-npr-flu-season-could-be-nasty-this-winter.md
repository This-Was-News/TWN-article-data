## Article summary
This winter's flu season is predicted to be severe due to a new variant of the H3N2 influenza virus circulating. Evidence from the southern hemisphere's flu season, which experienced prolonged activity, and the United Kingdom's current high rates of infection suggest a similar trend for the U.S. The dominant H3N2 strain is known to cause more problematic and severe illness. A newly evolved variant of this virus means the current flu vaccine may be less effective as it has mutated enough to evade existing protections. Despite this, health officials strongly recommend getting the flu shot as soon as possible, emphasizing that it still offers significant protection against hospitalization, particularly for children. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to become fully effective, and with flu activity already increasing, waiting is not advised. Experts are concerned about potentially lower vaccination rates this year due to public skepticism about vaccine safety and effectiveness, despite scientific consensus on their importance. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges it's too early to definitively assess the vaccine's efficacy, they encourage individuals to consult healthcare providers regarding the risks and benefits of vaccination. The flu season typically peaks around the holiday season and can cause thousands of deaths annually in the U.S.
