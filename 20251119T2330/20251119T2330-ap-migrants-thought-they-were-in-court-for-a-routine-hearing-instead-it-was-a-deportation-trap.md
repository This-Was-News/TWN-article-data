## Article summary
Routine immigration court hearings have transformed into deportation traps, with government lawyers coordinating with immigration agents to arrest migrants immediately after their cases are dismissed. This aggressive tactic, observed across 21 cities, is part of a broader overhaul of immigration courts under the Trump administration aimed at mass deportations. Despite claims of targeting dangerous individuals, many arrested have no criminal convictions. The court system, run by the Justice Department, lacks judicial independence, allowing the attorney general to influence decisions and fire judges with fewer restraints. This has led to a chilling effect, with judges facing pressure to meet quotas and migrants fearing arrest, leading to increased voluntary departures. The administration has also fired numerous immigration judges, particularly those perceived as lenient, and cut funding for legal assistance to migrants. These changes have resulted in families being torn apart and lives upended, with due process seemingly disregarded. Migrants are increasingly seeking recourse in federal courts, further straining the system. The article highlights poignant cases, including a father separated from his family and a former judge reflecting on the system's transformation.
