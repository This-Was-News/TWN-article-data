## Article summary
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's October meeting reveal a deeper division among officials regarding interest rate policy than previously understood. While the central bank ultimately voted for a second consecutive quarter-point rate cut, bringing rates to 3.75%-4%, many policymakers did not believe a December reduction was appropriate. The minutes indicate that some officials who supported the cut could have also supported holding rates steady, while several were outright against it. Policymakers expressed strongly differing views on the most suitable policy for the December meeting. Although most favored a gradual lowering of interest rates over time, a significant number preferred to keep rates unchanged for the rest of the year. This divergence is a continuation of a trend, as the October decision itself saw a rare two-way dissent. Fed Chair Jerome Powell had acknowledged this growing division at a press conference, stating that a December rate cut was not a foregone conclusion.
