## Article summary
For the first time in nearly three decades, Mexico has surpassed Canada to become the United States' top buyer of U.S. goods, according to U.S. government data. This shift highlights the deepening business ties between Mexico and the United States, despite occasional political friction, and underscores significant changes in global trade patterns. Mexico had already overtaken China two years prior as the leading country selling goods to the United States. Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico's economy minister, confirmed Mexico's position as the primary trading partner for the U.S. The data, released by the U.S. Commerce Department, also indicated the impact of President Trump's broad global tariffs on overall trade in August. Historically, Canada was the largest purchaser of U.S. goods, but Mexico has gradually gained ground. This change is partly attributed to a more contentious economic relationship between Canada and the Trump administration, which imposed tariffs on some Canadian exports. In contrast, Mexico has often received exemptions from these tariffs following negotiations. From January to August, U.S. exports to Mexico reached $226.4 billion, slightly exceeding the $225.6 billion sent to Canada.
