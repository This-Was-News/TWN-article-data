## Article summary
A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll indicates that Democrats hold a significant advantage heading into the 2026 midterm elections, marking their largest lead in eight years. The poll reveals that 55% of respondents would vote for a Democratic candidate for Congress if elections were held today, compared to 41% for Republicans. This comes amid warning signs for President Trump and the Republican party, with Trump's approval rating at a low of 39% and a majority blaming Republicans or Trump for the recent government shutdown. Americans overwhelmingly want the president to prioritize lowering prices, with 57% citing it as his top concern, far above immigration. The poll also highlights widespread disillusionment with political institutions; 80% have little to no confidence in Congress, and significant majorities express low confidence in the media, the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Supreme Court. Many respondents feel disconnected from both political parties, with some calling them "dishonest" and "closed-minded." Despite Trump's low approval, he maintains strong support from his base, but this does not necessarily translate to confidence in other Republican elected officials. The data suggests a volatile political landscape, but with Republicans currently holding power, Democrats appear to be in a favorable position for the upcoming midterms, though redistricting may limit the extent of potential gains.
