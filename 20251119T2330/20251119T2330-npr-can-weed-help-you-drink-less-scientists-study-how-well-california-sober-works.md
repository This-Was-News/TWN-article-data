## Article summary
Researchers are investigating the trend of being "California sober," which involves replacing alcohol consumption with cannabis. A study conducted at Brown University, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, aimed to scientifically test whether marijuana can help individuals reduce their alcohol intake. Scientists created a lab environment resembling a bar where participants were given cannabis and then offered alcoholic beverages. The findings indicated that participants who smoked higher potency cannabis drank 27% less alcohol, and those who used lower potency cannabis drank 19% less, compared to a placebo group. This suggests that cannabis may play a potential therapeutic role in managing alcohol use disorder, at least in the short term. However, researchers caution against recommending this as a treatment, emphasizing that more research is needed. They acknowledge that while cannabis may have fewer risks than alcohol, it is not without its own potential harms, including impaired cognition and psychiatric risks. The study also noted that individual responses can vary, with a minority of participants in a similar Colorado study actually drinking more when using cannabis. The trend of people self-medicating alcohol problems with cannabis without professional guidance is a growing concern, highlighting the need for clearer messaging and further investigation into the long-term effects and potential risks of replacing one substance with another.
