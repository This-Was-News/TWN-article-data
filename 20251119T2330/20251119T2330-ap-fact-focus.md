## Article summary
President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that military strikes on suspected drug boats are saving hundreds of thousands of American lives. However, experts dispute these figures, stating that the math and data do not support such claims. The number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. is significantly lower than the number of lives Trump suggests have been saved. For instance, preliminary CDC data indicates around 97,000 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. for a recent 12-month period. If each of the 21 boat strikes prevented 25,000 lives, it would imply over 525,000 lives saved, a number far exceeding actual overdose deaths. Experts like Carl Latkin and Lori Ann Post emphasize the lack of verifiable data and credible models linking these strikes to a reduction in drug use. They also point out that such claims oversimplify the complex issue of drug trafficking and addiction. Furthermore, a significant portion of opioid overdose deaths are linked to fentanyl, which is typically trafficked overland from Mexico, not primarily seized from boats in the Caribbean or Pacific. While overdose death rates have seen a recent decline, experts attribute this to a combination of factors, including the end of the pandemic, increased access to naloxone and addiction treatments, and changes in drug composition, rather than solely to these boat interdictions.
