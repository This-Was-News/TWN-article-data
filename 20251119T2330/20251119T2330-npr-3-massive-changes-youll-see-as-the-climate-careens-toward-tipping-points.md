## Article summary
Scientists are increasingly concerned that the planet is nearing critical climate tipping points, leading to massive and potentially irreversible changes. The goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is no longer plausible, with projections indicating a likely overshoot in the next decade. However, cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035 could still help return global temperatures to lower levels. Exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius, even temporarily, carries profound human costs, with scientists warning of devastating self-reinforcing changes. Three significant tipping points are highlighted: the potential permanent loss of coral reefs due to ocean warming and acidification, the collapse of ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica leading to significant sea-level rise, and the thawing of Arctic permafrost releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases. Coral reefs, vital ecosystems supporting 25% of marine life, are already experiencing widespread die-offs, with an estimated 99% potentially lost if warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius. The collapse of ice sheets, while unfolding over centuries, could raise global sea levels by feet. Thawing permafrost not only destabilizes Arctic landscapes and infrastructure but also releases potent greenhouse gases, creating a feedback loop that accelerates warming. The urgency to decarbonize society and transition to renewable energy is emphasized, as every tenth of a degree of warming and every action taken matters in mitigating these critical climate changes.
