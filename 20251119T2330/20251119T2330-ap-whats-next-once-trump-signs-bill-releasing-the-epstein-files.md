## Article summary
Congress is sending a bill to President Donald Trump that would compel the Justice Department to publicly release its case files on Jeffrey Epstein. This development follows a yearslong effort by Epstein's abuse survivors for a public reckoning. Both the House and Senate passed the bill with overwhelming bipartisan support after Trump indicated he would sign it. Once signed, the Justice Department will have 30 days to produce the "Epstein files." The bill mandates the release of investigation files, internal communications, and details about Epstein's death, with specific exemptions for victim information, child abuse materials, classified information, and ongoing investigations. Proponents hope for transparency, while some express concern that the Justice Department might open new investigations to shield information. The bill also requires the department to report on any withheld materials, prohibiting redactions based on embarrassment or political sensitivity. Many anticipate that the files could name individuals connected to Epstein, leading to expectations of further revelations about his associations with global leaders, including Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew. Survivors and some lawmakers are pushing for the release of names, even offering to read them on the House floor to provide legal protection.
