## Article summary
The Senate has passed a bill compelling the Justice Department to release its case files on Jeffrey Epstein, with President Donald Trump indicating he will sign it. This development marks a significant step in survivors' pursuit of a public reckoning regarding Epstein's abuse. The bill mandates the release of approximately 100,000 pages of investigative material and internal communications, though it exempts victim-identifying information and classified materials. In other news, the Justice Department acknowledged that the grand jury in the James Comey case did not review the final indictment, potentially impacting the prosecution. The U.S. trade deficit decreased by 24% in August, partly due to Trump's tariffs reducing imports. Meanwhile, top Army officials are in Ukraine to assist with peace talks, and Elon Musk made a quiet return to the public stage, discussing artificial intelligence and predicting the elimination of poverty through robots. The White House hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with discussions including potential Saudi investments in the U.S. and efforts to end the civil war in Sudan. Additionally, Melania Trump and Usha Vance visited military families in North Carolina, and Larry Summers resigned from OpenAI's board following the release of emails showing a continued relationship with Epstein.
