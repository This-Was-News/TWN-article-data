Hamas released all remaining living hostages in Gaza, marking a significant step in the ceasefire agreement with Israel after two years of war. U.S. President Donald Trump is in the region to discuss the U.S.-proposed deal and postwar plans with other leaders. The ceasefire includes the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and a surge of humanitarian aid to famine-stricken Gaza. Trump addressed the Knesset, emphasizing the end of the war and the potential for lasting peace. The summit in Egypt, co-chaired by Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, aims to solidify the ceasefire and address complex issues like disarming Hamas and Gaza's reconstruction. The release of hostages has brought relief and joy to families, with celebrations in Israel and international support for the peace process.
