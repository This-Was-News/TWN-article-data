## Article summary
Washington, D.C. is experiencing increased federal intervention, with troops patrolling streets and federal agents detaining residents. Congress has passed bills that further limit the city's autonomy. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's nonvoting House delegate, has faced criticism for not strongly opposing these interventions. Allies and former aides have called for her to step down, citing her age and diminished public presence. Two D.C. Council members have announced campaigns to replace her in the 2026 election. Norton has resisted these calls and plans to run for re-election. The city's autonomy is limited by a 1973 home rule agreement, with federal leaders retaining control over local affairs. President Trump's emergency order in August further restricted D.C.'s freedom, federalizing the police and deploying federal agents and National Guard troops. Despite the delegate's nonvoting status, the role is crucial for advocating for the district's interests. Norton's visibility has been low during recent events, with other city officials taking a more active role. Critics suggest a more active delegate might have helped avoid a recent $1.1 billion budget hole. Norton's life has been marked by significant civil rights work, including involvement in the March on Washington and the Freedom Summer. Former allies acknowledge her past accomplishments but suggest it may be time for new leadership.
