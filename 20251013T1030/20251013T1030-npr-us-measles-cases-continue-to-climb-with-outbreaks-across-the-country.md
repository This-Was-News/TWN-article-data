## Article summary
The U.S. is experiencing a significant rise in measles cases, with 1,563 confirmed cases this year, the highest in over three decades. Experts suggest the actual number may be closer to 5,000. Outbreaks are occurring in multiple states, including South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Minnesota. The majority of cases are in unvaccinated individuals, with children under 5 being particularly affected. Measles is highly contagious, with each infected person potentially spreading it to 18 others. Vaccination rates have been declining, currently at 92.5% nationwide, below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. The decline in vaccination rates is partly attributed to misinformation and political influences. Low vaccination rates in some communities create pockets where measles can spread rapidly. The recent Texas outbreak, with 762 cases and two deaths, highlights the severity of the situation. Health officials emphasize the importance of vaccination to control the spread of measles.
