## Article summary
President Trump addressed Israel's Parliament as Hamas released the last 20 living hostages from Gaza under a cease-fire deal brokered by the U.S. The hostages returned to Israel, while Palestinian prisoners were freed and sent to Ramallah. Trump declared the war over, but lingering questions remain about Gaza's future. A summit in Egypt was planned to discuss the cease-fire, with world leaders attending, though Netanyahu declined due to a Jewish holiday. The cease-fire brought relief to both Israelis and Palestinians, though some Gazans mourned their losses. Hamas' attack in 2023 killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted 250, while Israel's response killed 67,000 Palestinians. The deal includes the release of Palestinian prisoners and the return of hostage remains. Aid deliveries to Gaza have increased, and Trump's speech urged acceptance of Israel's existence and a transition to peace.
