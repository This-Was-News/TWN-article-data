## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance announced that the Trump administration will continue to fight in court to deploy the National Guard in Chicago, despite an appeals court blocking the deployment. The court ruled that while federalized National Guard members can remain in Illinois, they cannot be deployed for now. Vance argued that the administration has the authority to ensure public safety, particularly in Chicago. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, credited court rulings for keeping National Guard troops off Chicago's streets. The legal battle continues as Chicago prepares to host the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, expected to attract over 53,000 runners and 1.7 million spectators. ICE assured that it would not conduct operations at the marathon unless there are exigent circumstances. Chicago has become a focal point in the Trump administration's national immigration crackdown, with ongoing clashes between protesters and federal agents. Recently, a journalist was detained during a protest but later released without charges. The situation remains tense as the administration and local leaders continue to clash over the deployment of National Guard troops.
