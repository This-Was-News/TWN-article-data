## Article summary
Hamas released the final 20 living Israeli hostages from Gaza as part of a cease-fire deal with Israel, which in return is expected to release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The hostages, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, were handed over to the Red Cross and then to the Israeli military, who transported them to hospitals in Tel Aviv. Celebrations erupted in Israel, with tens of thousands gathering in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. Hamas is also required to hand over 28 bodies of dead hostages, though not all have been located. President Trump, who played a key role in the ceasefire deal, arrived in Israel and is scheduled to meet with hostage families and address the Knesset before traveling to Egypt for a formal signing ceremony. The ceasefire has led to increased aid flowing into Gaza, which is in urgent need of essential supplies. The exchange of hostages and prisoners is a significant test of the ceasefire, but many challenges remain, including the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the future governance of the territory. Hamas has not publicly agreed to disarm and give up its role in governance, and no interim Palestinian leadership has been named.
