## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance warned of deeper cuts to the federal workforce as the government shutdown entered its 12th day, with hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed without pay. The Trump administration ensured military pay and some services for low-income Americans, but the Smithsonian closed its museums and the National Zoo due to lack of funding. Vance emphasized the painful nature of these cuts, blaming Democrats for the stalemate. Labor unions sued to stop the aggressive move by the Trump administration, which goes beyond typical shutdown procedures. The shutdown began after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix, demanding an extension of federal health insurance subsidies. Trump and Republican leaders insist the government must reopen first before negotiating health subsidies. Negotiations are currently nonexistent, with both parties blaming each other. Progressive activists support the Democratic position, noting fractures within the GOP. Thousands of federal employees face layoff notices, with Democrats calling the firings illegal and unnecessary.
