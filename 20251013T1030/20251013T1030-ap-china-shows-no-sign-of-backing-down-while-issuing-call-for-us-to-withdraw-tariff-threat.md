## Article summary
China and the U.S. are locked in a trade war, with China calling for the U.S. to withdraw a 100% tariff threat on Chinese imports. The U.S. imposed the threat after China restricted rare earth exports, which are crucial for electronics. Trump, while not withdrawing the threat, expressed a more conciliatory tone, stating the U.S. wants to help China. China's Ministry of Commerce criticized the U.S. for damaging trade negotiation atmosphere and urged a correction of erroneous practices. Both countries have taken various measures, including U.S. restrictions on computer chip imports and China ending soybean purchases. The trade war has led to a decline in Chinese exports to the U.S., with a 27% drop in September compared to the previous year. The ongoing tensions and retaliatory actions are impacting trade between the two nations.
