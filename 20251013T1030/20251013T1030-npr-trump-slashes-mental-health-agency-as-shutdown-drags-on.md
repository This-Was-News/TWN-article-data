## Article summary
The Trump administration has laid off over 100 employees at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of a government-wide reduction in force during the ongoing shutdown. Employees were notified of the layoffs late Friday, with no clear rationale provided. SAMHSA, responsible for the 988 suicide prevention hotline and billions in mental health grants, has seen its workforce reduced to nearly half. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed the cuts, blaming the Democrat-led shutdown. SAMHSA's budget and role have been targeted by the Trump administration, with plans to fold its duties into a new program. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also experienced layoffs, though some were later revoked. The cuts at the CDC affected key areas like disease surveillance and immunization. HHS indicated more cuts may follow, aligning with the administration's health agenda. The layoffs have raised concerns about the impact on mental health and public health services.
