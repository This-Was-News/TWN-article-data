## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced sweeping layoffs at the U.S. Department of Education, significantly impacting the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). The reduction-in-force (RIF) affects dozens of staff responsible for overseeing $15 billion in special education funding and ensuring states provide services to 7.5 million children with disabilities. The layoffs, part of broader cuts totaling 4,200 jobs, have raised concerns about the future of special education oversight and support. Employees fear that key responsibilities, such as reviewing state plans and providing technical assistance, will go unmet. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a civil rights law, guarantees education for children with disabilities, and OSERS staff play a crucial role in ensuring compliance. The cuts have been criticized for potentially violating federal law and leaving families without support. President Trump's plan to return education to the states has been cited as a motive behind the layoffs, but concerns about inconsistent state interpretations of the law have been raised. The layoffs are seen as a significant blow to the rights and services of children with disabilities.
