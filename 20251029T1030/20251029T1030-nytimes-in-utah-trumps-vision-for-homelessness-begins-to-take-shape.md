## Article summary
Utah is developing a large-scale campus on the outskirts of Salt Lake City to house and treat up to 1,300 homeless individuals, reflecting a national shift in homelessness policy embraced by President Trump. Supporters describe it as a services campus offering involuntary addiction and mental health treatment, while critics liken it to a prison or detention camp. The plan, which began before Trump's return to office but accelerated after his executive order, involves stern measures to move unhoused people to the remote site, potentially as an alternative to jail. State officials vow to address untreated afflictions and guide homeless individuals toward "human thriving" through a "treatment first" model, contrasting with the previous "Housing First" approach. Critics, however, express concerns about civil liberties, the feasibility of promised services amid Medicaid cuts, and the potential for the facility to become a warehouse rather than a treatment center. The plan's financing and operational details remain unclear, with proposals to redirect federal homelessness grants raising further anxieties among service providers. The project also faces scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest regarding its leadership. While some unhoused individuals see potential benefits in services away from urban drug markets, others are deeply skeptical, comparing the concept to concentration camps and questioning the freedom to leave. Governor Spencer Cox has lauded the campus as a significant step forward, framing it as a statement of the state's values.
