## Article summary
A federal judge has disqualified Bill Essayli, the Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, ruling that he is not lawfully serving in that capacity. This decision marks the latest in a series of challenges against the Trump administration's strategy of appointing federal prosecutors without congressional approval. The judge, J. Michael Seabright, stated that while Essayli is not legally acting as U.S. Attorney, he can continue as the office's top deputy. This ruling creates leadership uncertainty in the Central District of California, the nation's largest judicial district. The judge acknowledged concerns that the Department of Justice might be circumventing the law but felt constrained by the statutes. The disqualification does not dismiss the three criminal cases Essayli's office is prosecuting, though his supervision role is now as deputy. This situation is similar to other cases where acting U.S. attorneys appointed by the Trump administration have been challenged, including in Nevada and New Jersey. These appointments, often extended beyond the initial 120-day interim period without Senate or judicial confirmation, are being scrutinized for their legitimacy. Essayli, a Trump ally, has been more politically outspoken than his predecessors, criticizing state politicians and taking high-profile roles in immigration-related matters. The case is expected to be appealed, with the judge noting that it would likely reach a higher court regardless of his ruling.
