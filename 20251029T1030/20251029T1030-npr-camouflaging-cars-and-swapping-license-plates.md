## Article summary
Federal agents conducting immigration arrests are increasingly using camouflaged tactics, including wearing masks and utilizing vehicles without license plates or with swapped plates. This practice, observed in various locations across the U.S., aims to prevent agents from being doxxed, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). However, immigration advocates and some state officials argue that these methods obscure accountability and undermine public trust. Videos circulating on social media show unmarked vehicles, some with temporary or foreign license plates, involved in arrests. While a federal regulation allows for the exemption of license plates in certain law enforcement situations, guidelines suggest this should be an exception, not the norm. ICE has not provided requested documents regarding license plate waivers. The use of such tactics raises concerns about transparency and the ability to investigate potential rights violations, as it becomes difficult to identify the specific agencies and individuals involved in arrests. Some vehicles have even been seen with Mexican flags or license plates, further complicating identification and raising questions about the agencies involved.
