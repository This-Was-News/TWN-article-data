## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa, with its record-tying 185 mph winds, has been described as an extreme "beast" among a surge of powerful Atlantic storms. Scientists are amazed by Melissa's ability to defy typical weakening factors, including rapid intensification, gaining approximately 70 mph in wind speed over a 24-hour period. The storm's landfall strength tied records for wind speed and barometric pressure, matching the 1935 Labor Day storm and Hurricane Dorian. Unlike most major hurricanes, Melissa did not undergo an eyewall replacement cycle, which usually weakens them. It also remarkably maintained its strength despite passing over mountainous Jamaica, an unusual occurrence. Furthermore, Melissa continued to gain power over warm waters, a phenomenon attributed in part to climate change, which makes such warm conditions 500 to 700 times more likely. Analysis shows a significant increase in Category 5 hurricanes in recent years, with nearly 29% occurring since 2016. While acknowledging improvements in data collection, scientists generally agree that a warmer world is producing more intense storms. The rapid intensification of storms like Melissa is fueled by exceptionally warm ocean waters, a direct consequence of climate change, providing the necessary energy for storms to reach unprecedented levels.
