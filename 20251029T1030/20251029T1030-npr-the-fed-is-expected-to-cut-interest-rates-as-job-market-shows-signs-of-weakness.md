## Article summary
The Federal Reserve is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, shifting its focus from combating inflation to supporting the job market. This move comes as several major corporations, including Amazon and Target, announce significant layoffs, and the federal government has also reduced its workforce. The Fed's decision-making is complicated by a government shutdown that has halted the release of crucial economic data, making it difficult to assess the true state of the economy. While inflation remains a concern, policymakers are prioritizing the prevention of a substantial rise in unemployment. Fed Governor Chris Waller has expressed that his primary concern is the labor market, noting a weakening in payroll gains and potential job shrinkage. Analysts are looking at alternative data sources, such as ADP's private sector hiring reports, to gauge economic trends, though these numbers can differ from official government figures. A weaker job market could negatively impact consumer spending, which has so far remained resilient due to a relatively strong labor market. However, the lack of official unemployment data for recent months makes it challenging to get a complete picture. Fed officials are relying on anecdotal evidence from business contacts, which presents a mixed view of softening labor conditions alongside continued consumer spending, particularly among wealthier individuals.
