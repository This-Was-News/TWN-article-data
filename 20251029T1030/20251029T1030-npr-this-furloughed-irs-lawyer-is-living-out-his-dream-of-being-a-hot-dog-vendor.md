## Article summary
Amidst a government shutdown, furloughed IRS lawyer Isaac Stein has turned his childhood dream into a reality by operating a hot dog stand called "Shysters Dogs" in Washington, D.C. Stein, who normally writes tax regulations, is now selling hot dogs with a cheeky menu that includes "correct" and "wrong" toppings, with a playful penalty for the latter. The stand, which he had planned to start as a side project, has become a full-time endeavor due to his furlough. His menu also features RC Cola, MoonPies, and dog treats, with a discount for reciting their historical significance. Stein humorously offers to give away the shirt off his back for a "solid grand." He sells about 50 hot dogs daily and, while eager to return to his IRS job, intends to keep "Shysters Dogs" as a lifelong weekend project, aiming to bring laughter to the community.
