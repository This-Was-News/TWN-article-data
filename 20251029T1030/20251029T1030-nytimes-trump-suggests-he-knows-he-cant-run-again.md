## Article summary
President Trump has suggested he understands he is constitutionally ineligible to run for a third term, expressing regret that he cannot seek the presidency again in 2028. Speaking to reporters, he noted his current high approval and economic achievements, but acknowledged that 'I guess I'm not allowed to run.' This comes after House Speaker Mike Johnson stated there is no way around the Constitution's two-term limit. Trump had previously discussed the possibility of serving a third term for months, vacillating between joking and signaling a desire to test constitutional bounds. He indicated he has accepted the 22nd Amendment's restriction, stating, 'If you read it, it's pretty clear I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad.' His former strategist, Steve Bannon, had vaguely suggested a plan for Trump to be president in 2028. Allies had previously floated loopholes, such as Trump running as vice president, but Trump dismissed this as 'too cute' and something the public wouldn't like. He has also mentioned other potential Republican candidates and tickets, including his vice president, JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
