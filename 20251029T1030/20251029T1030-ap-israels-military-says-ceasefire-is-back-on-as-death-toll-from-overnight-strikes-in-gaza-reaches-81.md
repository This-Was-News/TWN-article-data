## Article summary
Israel's military announced that a ceasefire in Gaza was back in effect after conducting airstrikes that killed at least 81 Palestinians, including women and children. These strikes, the deadliest since the ceasefire began on October 10th, were ordered by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after accusing Hamas of violating the truce. U.S. President Donald Trump defended Israel's actions, stating they were justified following an incident where Hamas allegedly killed an Israeli soldier. Hamas denied involvement and accused Israel of violating the ceasefire. Hospitals in Gaza reported a high death toll, with many of the wounded in critical condition. The strikes followed an incident where Israel claimed Hamas handed over partial remains of a hostage, which Netanyahu called a clear violation of the agreement. The Israeli military stated its forces targeted terrorists and command positions. Hamas, however, insisted it was not involved in the Rafah gunfire and reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire, calling Israel's actions a blatant violation. The violence has led to widespread destruction and civilian casualties, with survivors describing the devastating impact of the strikes.
