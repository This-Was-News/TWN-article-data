## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa made landfall in eastern Cuba as a Category 3 storm early Wednesday, packing sustained winds of 120 mph. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated to shelters in Cuba, with a hurricane warning in effect for several eastern provinces. The storm, which pummeled Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, was forecast to cross Cuba and move into the Bahamas. Forecasters warned of life-threatening flooding and numerous landslides due to intense rain. Melissa struck Jamaica on Tuesday with top sustained winds of 185 mph, causing extensive damage, downed trees, power outages, and flooding. In Jamaica, four hospitals were damaged, and over half a million customers lost power. The storm is blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic. Cuban President Díaz-Canel assured that "no one is left behind and no resources are spared to protect the lives of the population," urging citizens not to underestimate the storm's power. Classes were suspended in several Cuban provinces in preparation. Jamaica hopes to reopen airports by Thursday to facilitate the distribution of emergency relief supplies.
