## Article summary
Former Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams were seen together at a Knicks game, sparking speculation about a potential endorsement. Cuomo, trailing in the polls, joined Adams courtside after a mayoral debate, aiming to gain support from Adams' base. Adams, who dropped out of the mayoral race, has been critical of Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani but has not yet endorsed Cuomo. Both Cuomo and Adams share similar political views, contrasting with Mamdani's socialist ideals. Adams' endorsement could help Cuomo, but its impact is uncertain. Adams has criticized Mamdani's policies, including rent freezes and decriminalizing prostitution. The race remains competitive, with Cuomo hoping for a last-minute boost. Mamdani has also been active in campaigning, appearing with Knicks superfan Spike Lee. The outcome of Adams' potential endorsement remains to be seen.
