## Article summary
President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon and Illinois is facing legal challenges, with courts deciding whether to defer to his assessment of lawlessness in Portland and Chicago. Both deployments were initially blocked by district courts but have seen mixed rulings from appeals courts. The 9th Circuit overturned a restraining order in Oregon, allowing troops to be deployed, while the 7th Circuit upheld a block in Illinois. The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in soon, with decisions that could impact future deployments and set precedents for presidential authority. Legal experts warn that the rulings could embolden the administration or lead to further confusion. The cases highlight tensions between federal and state authorities, with implications for the use of military force domestically. The outcomes will likely influence how courts handle similar situations in the future, with experts predicting a prolonged legal battle.
