## Article summary
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to travel to Israel following Vice President JD Vance's visit to maintain the momentum of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Vance recently opened a civilian-military coordination center in southern Israel, involving 200 U.S. troops and international delegations to aid Gaza's stabilization and reconstruction. Rubio aims to visit this center and appoint a Foreign Service official to work with Vice Adm. Brad Cooper. The U.S. seeks support from allies, particularly Gulf nations, to form an international stabilization force for Gaza and train a non-Hamas Palestinian police force. Rubio criticized a symbolic bill in the Israeli parliament that could lead to the annexation of the occupied West Bank, a move the U.S. opposes. Vance visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and met with Israeli officials, emphasizing a partnership rather than a vassal state relationship. Meanwhile, the first medical evacuation from Gaza since the ceasefire began, involving 41 critical patients, highlighted the dire healthcare conditions. U.N. officials described the devastation in Gaza, with women giving birth in rubble due to the lack of healthcare facilities. Israel's Supreme Court is considering opening Gaza to international media, currently blocked since the war started in October 2023. The Foreign Press Association expressed disappointment over the delay in granting journalists access. Palestinian journalists have faced severe restrictions and dangers, with around 200 killed by Israeli fire.
