## Article summary
Iceland has recorded the presence of mosquitoes for the first time in its history, with three *Culiseta annulata* mosquitoes confirmed by the Natural Science Institute of Iceland. These mosquitoes, likely arriving by freight, can withstand Iceland's climate. The discovery is attributed to a warming climate and increased international transportation. Insect enthusiast Björn Hjaltason found the mosquitoes on a farm near Reykjavík. While mosquitoes are a nuisance, they do not carry known infections in the region. Climate change is causing temperatures to rise globally, with the Arctic warming at more than double the global average. *Culiseta annulata* are large mosquitoes found in Europe and Nordic countries, capable of living in cold weather. Antarctica remains the only place believed to have no mosquitoes. There are over 3,000 mosquito species worldwide, some of which can transmit severe diseases like malaria and dengue fever.
