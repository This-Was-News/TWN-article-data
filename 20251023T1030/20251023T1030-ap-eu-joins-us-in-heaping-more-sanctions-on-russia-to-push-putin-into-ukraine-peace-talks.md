## Article summary
The European Union has imposed additional economic sanctions on Russia, targeting its oil and gas sectors, shadow fleet, and financial institutions, in an effort to pressure President Vladimir Putin into negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. These measures, announced during an EU summit in Brussels, are seen as a victory for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has long advocated for stronger international action against Russia. Despite U.S.-led peace efforts, the war, now in its third year, shows no signs of abating, with both sides continuing to engage in fierce combat. Ukrainian forces have managed to hold off the larger Russian army along a extensive front line, while Russian strikes on Ukraine's power grid and Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries and manufacturing plants continue. The EU's new sanctions aim to cut off the revenue that funds Russia's invasion, with a particular focus on the Russian shadow fleet of tankers evading sanctions. Zelenskyy urged more countries to join the sanctions, while Russian state media dismissed the measures as largely ineffective. The sanctions have caused international crude prices to rise, and the EU's decision-making process for such measures can be lengthy, with Moscow often finding ways to circumvent them. Meanwhile, Putin directed nuclear drills, and both sides continued to exchange strikes, with reports of Russian drone attacks in Ukraine and Ukrainian drone strikes in Russia.
