## Article summary
Crews are demolishing the East Wing of the White House to make way for a new ballroom, sparking controversy. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has called for a pause, citing legal requirements for public review. The White House argues that demolition does not fall under these laws. Historians, like Kate Andersen Brower, express concern over the diminishment of the first lady's role, as the East Wing has traditionally housed her offices. The last major renovation was during Harry Truman's presidency, funded by taxpayers. This current project, costing $200 million, is funded privately, raising ethical concerns. Historical artifacts from Rosalyn Carter's office, the first lady who professionalized the role, have been preserved. Melania Trump's limited presence in the East Wing is noted, contrasting with Carter's daily use. The necessity of the ballroom's size is questioned, as it will be larger than the White House itself. The interview was edited for clarity and aired on October 22, 2025.
