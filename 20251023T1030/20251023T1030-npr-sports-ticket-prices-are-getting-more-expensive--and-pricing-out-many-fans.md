## Article summary
Sports ticket prices in the U.S. have more than doubled in the past 25 years, driven by higher costs and strategic pricing. Teams prefer selling fewer seats at higher prices, using dynamic pricing and offering premium experiences to maximize revenue. Bob Hinz, a long-time Baltimore Orioles season ticket holder, faces significant price increases, forcing him to reconsider his loyalty. The Orioles have introduced more expensive season ticket packages, aligning with other MLB teams. Hinz, shocked by a 35% per-game price increase, feels like just another number to the team. Sports economics expert Victor Matheson explains that teams aim to make more money from fewer, more expensive tickets. Teams are also investing in premium seats and experiences, such as club areas and special game features. The Orioles are renovating Camden Yards, including a premium club, funded partly by taxpayers. Hinz, torn between his love for the team and financial reality, decides to give up his season tickets after over 20 years. Despite his loyalty, the business aspect of sports ultimately prevails.
