## Article summary
The U.S. Coast Guard is providing a base for U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in the San Francisco area to track down immigrants and provide security. Over 100 agents will arrive at the base in Alameda, a move condemned by San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who believe it is meant to provoke violent protests. Lurie warned against giving federal officials an excuse to crack down and criticized aggressive enforcement tactics. President Donald Trump has previously deployed the National Guard to other cities, citing crime concerns, but local leaders in San Francisco dispute his claims. Newsom and other officials have vowed to fight any deployment of troops to San Francisco, with plans to file lawsuits if necessary. The Coast Guard base is located between Oakland and San Francisco, both sanctuary cities. Lurie urged peaceful protests and signed an executive directive to support immigrants, while Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee opposed federal military involvement.
