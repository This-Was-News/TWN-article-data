## Article summary
President Donald Trump's administration imposed new sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil to pressure President Vladimir Putin into negotiating an end to the Ukraine war. The sanctions aim to cripple Russia's oil industry, its economic backbone, and were announced during NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's visit to Washington. Meanwhile, Russia launched drone and missile attacks across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a mother and her two daughters, and injuring 29 others. The attacks targeted multiple cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, where a kindergarten was hit. Zelenskyy urged international pressure on Russia through sanctions and coordinated diplomacy. Upcoming meetings, including an EU summit and a Coalition of the Willing gathering, are expected to discuss further sanctions. Ukraine claimed strikes on Russian military and industrial targets, while Zelenskyy secured a potential deal for Swedish Gripen fighter jets. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has been supplying Russia with critical technology for its war efforts.
