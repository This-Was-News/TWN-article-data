## Article summary
The final New York City mayoral debate featured intense exchanges between Zohran Mamdani, Andrew M. Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, the Democratic front-runner, played it safe, avoiding contentious issues and pledging to keep the police commissioner, Jessica Tisch. Cuomo, running as an independent, attacked Mamdani's experience and evasiveness, while Sliwa, the Republican candidate, joined in, criticizing Mamdani's policies and commitment to combating antisemitism. The candidates debated housing, public safety, immigration raids, and their plans for the city. Cuomo and Sliwa often ganged up on Mamdani, highlighting his lack of experience and flip-flopping on issues. Sliwa was more focused on policy but less entertaining, while Cuomo struggled with past controversies. All three candidates criticized recent ICE raids on Canal Street, offering different approaches to handling President Trump's actions. The debate included sharp one-liners and personal attacks, with each candidate trying to outdo the others in wit and policy proposals.
