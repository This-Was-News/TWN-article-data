## Article summary
Michael and Susan Dell have committed $6.25 billion to fund investment accounts for 25 million U.S. children. This significant donation aims to provide a financial head start to young Americans, particularly those from lower-income households. The gift will seed "Trump Accounts," a program established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which provides an initial $1,000 from the U.S. Treasury to babies born from 2025 through 2028. The Dells' contribution specifically targets children aged 10 and under who are too old to receive the initial federal funding. Eligible children must have a Social Security number and be 10 years old or younger, born before January 1, 2025, and reside in ZIP codes with a median income below $150,000. The Dells' gift will place $250 into each eligible child's account, intended to grow through investments in low-cost stock index funds. Parents are encouraged to mark July 4, 2026, as the date they can claim these accounts for their children. While the exact administration details of the Trump Accounts are still being finalized, the potential benefits are substantial. With maximum contributions, a Trump Account could be worth nearly $1.1 million by the time the beneficiary is 28 years old, though this figure drops significantly if no additional contributions are made. Financial experts advise families to consult with a tax or financial advisor regarding this new savings plan.
