## Article summary
Christian 'momfluencers' are increasingly shaping the American right by blending faith, polished aesthetics, and personal narratives to influence followers on issues ranging from vaccines and food safety to gender identity and immigration. Influencers like Allie Beth Stuckey, Alex Clark, and Riley Gaines Barker leverage maternal concerns and a sense of community to draw women into conservative political engagement, often framing it as a spiritual battle. The COVID-19 pandemic, particularly vaccine mandates, served as a catalyst for many, sparking distrust in established institutions and opening them to alternative viewpoints. These influencers build trust through personal stories and relatable content, addressing anxieties about health, education, and societal changes. They often emphasize traditional gender roles and femininity, positioning themselves as guides through what they perceive as a culture war against progressive values. Their rhetoric, though sometimes controversial, is seen by supporters as a necessary defense of biblical truths and a return to objective reality. This movement has had tangible political impacts, influencing legislation on issues like transgender participation in sports and public health policies. While some critics worry about the dehumanizing nature of their language, these influencers and their followers feel they are gaining ground in a cultural and spiritual fight.
