## Article summary
A year after Bitcoin reached a landmark $100,000, soaring prices and optimistic predictions of $250,000 by 2025 have not materialized. Over the past two months, Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, falling to $82,000 from $126,000, erasing most of its yearly gains, with other cryptocurrencies like Ether also plummeting. This downturn highlights the increasing ties between the crypto market and the broader economy, influenced by factors such as tariff threats and interest rate speculation. High-risk practices within the crypto world, particularly leveraged trading, have exacerbated losses when the market declines. Despite growing mainstream acceptance and favorable regulatory shifts, including government approval of crypto products and the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve, the digital asset remains a volatile investment. The impact of the sell-off has extended to publicly traded companies that invested heavily in crypto, leading to stock price declines and financial struggles. A key concern is the potential for large holders like Strategy, which possesses over $58 billion in Bitcoin, to be forced to sell, further depressing prices. The market turbulence, while significant, has not reached the catastrophic levels seen in 2022, and some long-term investors may still hold substantial profits. Nevertheless, the recent crash serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in the cryptocurrency space.
