## Article summary
Costco has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration regarding tariffs, joining a growing number of companies seeking refunds if the Supreme Court deems the import duties illegal. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing the legality of President Trump's tariffs on nearly all imports, with justices appearing skeptical during recent oral arguments. Lower courts had previously ruled that Trump misused emergency economic powers to implement these tariffs. Numerous companies, including Revlon, Bumble Bee, and Kawasaki, have already initiated legal action to secure potential refunds. Costco's lawsuit marks a significant development, as larger corporations are now publicly challenging the tariffs, following the lead of smaller businesses. While Costco did not disclose the exact amount paid in tariffs, the company expressed concern about its ability to recover all funds even if the tariffs are invalidated. Approximately one-third of Costco's U.S. sales consist of imported goods, primarily nonfood items.
