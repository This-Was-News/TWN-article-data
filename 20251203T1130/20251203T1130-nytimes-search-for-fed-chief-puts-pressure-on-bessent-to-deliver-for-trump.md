## Article summary
President Trump's frustration with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's interest rate policies has intensified, leading him to criticize his former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for recommending Powell in 2017. As Powell's term nears its end, the selection of his successor places significant pressure on current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Trump expects his nominee to aggressively cut interest rates, and he has publicly linked Bessent's success to the Fed's actions, even joking about firing him if rates aren't lowered quickly. While the final decision rests with Trump, Bessent is tasked with navigating the process to find a candidate aligned with the White House's desire for lower rates. Bessent has gained Trump's favor through market stabilization and criticism of liberal policies, and Trump has even suggested Bessent could lead the Fed. However, if the chosen Fed chair fails to lower rates sufficiently or comply with the administration's wishes, Bessent could face blame. Kevin A. Hassett is considered the leading candidate, known for his loyalty and ability to translate economic concepts for Trump. Other contenders include Kevin M. Warsh, Christopher J. Waller, and Rick Rieder. Trump's push for lower rates contrasts with the Fed's cautious approach, driven by inflation concerns and a slowing labor market. This pressure campaign has led to Trump attempting to reshape the Fed's leadership, including installing loyalists and trying to remove existing governors. The chosen Fed chair will likely face resistance from other Fed officials and Wall Street if they push for rates below what the economic conditions warrant. Regardless of the pick, Bessent is expected to monitor the new Fed chair's performance, continuing a tradition of weekly economic discussions while also demonstrating a willingness to publicly comment on monetary policy, a departure from previous Treasury secretaries.
