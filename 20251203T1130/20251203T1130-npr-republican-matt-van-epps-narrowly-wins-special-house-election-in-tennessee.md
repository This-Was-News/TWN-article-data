## Article summary
Republican Matt Van Epps won Tennessee's 7th Congressional District in a special election, narrowly defeating Democratic State Rep. Aftyn Behn by 9 percentage points. The race garnered national attention and significant outside spending, with over $6.5 million invested by various groups. Despite Trump winning the district by a larger margin in the past, Behn's performance was seen as a Democratic overperformance, suggesting a potential shift in voter allegiances. This closer-than-expected contest sets the stage for the 2026 midterm elections, where affordability is expected to be a key issue. Both candidates focused on economic concerns, with Van Epps embracing Trump's endorsement and Behn promising to address the cost of living. Democrats are touting the results as a sign of their resurgence, while Republicans are emphasizing the importance of aligning with former President Trump for victory. Van Epps' win expands the Republican House majority to 220-213 until January 2026. The election saw a significant increase in turnout, driven by substantial campaign spending in the final weeks. Democrats highlighted their improved margins in special elections across the country, indicating a potential challenge to Republican dominance.
