## Article summary
President Trump has dismissed concerns about the cost of living for Americans, calling affordability a "con job" created by Democrats. This statement comes as his political advantage on the economy appears to be diminishing. Trump's remarks during a cabinet meeting targeted Democrats, who have successfully used the issue of affordability to win recent elections. He claimed that Democrats are using a "fake narrative" to mislead the public. Despite his current stance, Trump had previously positioned himself as the "affordability president" just days before. The Trump administration has recently introduced new policies and adjusted its economic messaging in response to Democratic successes driven by a focus on prices. The article suggests that the issue of affordability is likely to be a significant factor in the upcoming midterm elections.
