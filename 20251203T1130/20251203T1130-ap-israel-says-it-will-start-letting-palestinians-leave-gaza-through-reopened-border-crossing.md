## Article summary
Israel has announced it will permit Palestinians to depart the Gaza Strip via the Rafah border crossing, aligning with a U.S.-backed ceasefire agreement. This decision comes despite Israel's statement that partial remains returned by militants do not match the hostages still held in Gaza, potentially jeopardizing the ceasefire's initial phase. The plan, which involves the return of remaining hostages, also includes the formation of an international stabilization force, a technocratic Palestinian government, and the disarmament of Hamas. The World Health Organization has highlighted the urgent need for over 16,500 sick and wounded individuals to leave Gaza for medical treatment. Forensic tests confirmed that the remains returned on Tuesday did not match those of Israeli hostage Ran Gvili or Thai national Sudthisak Rinthalak, who are still unaccounted for. Palestinian Islamic Jihad's military wing stated its militants were searching for the remains in northern Gaza, accompanied by Red Cross workers. The Rafah crossing, sealed in May 2024, will be open for medical evacuations and travel, with Israeli security approval required for those exiting. An Israeli official indicated that all Palestinians wishing to leave could do so if Egypt agrees to receive them, but the crossing would not be open for returnees. Concurrently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed an envoy to engage in talks with Lebanese officials regarding potential relations and economic cooperation, despite the long-standing state of war between the two nations. Meanwhile, a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli fire in Gaza City, adding to the reported Palestinian fatalities. The exchanges of bodies have been central to the ceasefire's initial phase, with Israel releasing Palestinian bodies for each hostage's remains, although identification has been challenging due to a lack of resources.
