## Article summary
Republican Matt Van Epps has won a special election for a U.S. House seat in Tennessee, securing the conservative district with support from former President Donald Trump. Despite the victory, Van Epps's comparatively slim margin of victory, around 9 percentage points, has fueled Democratic hopes for the upcoming midterm elections. Van Epps, a military veteran, defeated Democratic state Representative Aftyn Behn, who ran as a progressive and garnered strong support in Davidson County. Van Epps emphasized his alignment with Trump, stating "this is President Trump's party." Trump congratulated Van Epps on his win, attributing it to overcoming opposition from the "Radical Left Democrats." Behn, despite her loss, expressed optimism, framing the result as the "beginning of a next chapter of Tennessee and American politics." Democratic leaders believe this outcome signals an "on offense" stance for their party. The race saw significant spending, with the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. contributing nearly $1.7 million to support Van Epps. Republicans had redrawn the district in 2022 to make it more favorable for their party. Behn's campaign focused on criticizing economic policies, while Republicans used her own words against her in advertising.
