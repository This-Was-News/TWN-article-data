## Article summary
The Trump administration is defending its campaign of striking suspected drug smuggling boats, but confusion surrounds who is responsible for authorizing deadly force. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated he authorized the initial attack on a boat in September but did not witness the subsequent strikes that killed survivors, claiming Admiral Frank M. Bradley ordered those. This division of responsibility has drawn criticism, with some, like Representative Adam Smith, arguing Hegseth bears ultimate responsibility. The administration's legal justification, based on a memo asserting a non-international armed conflict with drug cartels, has been called ambiguous by critics. Questions about the legality and morality of these strikes have intensified following reports of a second round of strikes hitting survivors of the initial attack. Experts and human rights advocates argue that without a declared war, these actions could be considered murder rather than war crimes, setting a dangerous precedent for unchecked global action. President Trump has broadly justified the strikes as saving lives, while also claiming limited knowledge of specific details. Senator Rand Paul's inquiry suggests a significant percentage of interdictions yield no drugs, raising concerns about the accuracy of targeting. Admiral Bradley is expected to face congressional scrutiny regarding these incidents.
