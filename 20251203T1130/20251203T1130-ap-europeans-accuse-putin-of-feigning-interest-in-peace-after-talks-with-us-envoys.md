## Article summary
European and Ukrainian officials have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of feigning interest in peace efforts following talks with U.S. envoys that yielded no breakthrough. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper urged Putin to end the "bluster and the bloodshed" and come to the table for a "just and lasting peace," while Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha implored him to stop "wasting the world's time." These statements highlight the significant divide between Russia and its European allies regarding the resolution of the ongoing war. Putin had previously accused Europeans of sabotaging U.S.-led peace efforts and warned of Russia's readiness for war with Europe if provoked. While the U.S. under President Trump has tempered its support for Kyiv and pushed for an end to the conflict, a recent U.S. peace proposal was criticized for heavily favoring Moscow. European leaders expressed concern that Russian gains in Ukraine could embolden further threats against their own countries. The fate of occupied Ukrainian regions remains a major hurdle, with Ukraine unwilling to cede territory. European NATO countries, meanwhile, are increasing military assistance to Ukraine, emphasizing the need to maintain pressure on Russia. The war continues with attritional battles and long-range strikes, with recent drone attacks by Russia in Ukraine resulting in casualties, and falling drone debris causing a fire at an oil depot in Russia.
