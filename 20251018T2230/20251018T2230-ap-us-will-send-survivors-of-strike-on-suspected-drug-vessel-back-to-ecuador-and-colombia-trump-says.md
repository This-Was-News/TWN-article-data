## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean will be sent back to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia. The strike, which occurred on Thursday, targeted a submersible vessel carrying fentanyl and other illegal narcotics. The military rescued two survivors and confirmed that two people were killed, bringing the total deaths from such strikes to at least 29 since early September. Trump justified the strikes by asserting an armed conflict with drug cartels, using legal authority similar to that used post-9/11. The repatriation of the survivors aims to avoid legal questions about their status in the U.S. justice system. The strikes have caused unease among Congress members and sparked debates over the legality and oversight of such military actions. Additionally, Trump mentioned Venezuela's efforts to stave off U.S. pressure, including offers of stakes in the country's oil and mineral wealth. Congress is considering measures to require approval for future strikes and to prevent an outright attack on Venezuela without congressional authorization.
