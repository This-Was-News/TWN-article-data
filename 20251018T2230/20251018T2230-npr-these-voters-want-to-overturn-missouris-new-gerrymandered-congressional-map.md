## Article summary
Thousands of Missouri voters are protesting the state's new gerrymandered congressional map, which was signed into law by Republican Governor Mike Kehoe. The map, designed to favor the GOP, targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat and splits Kansas City into three Republican-leaning districts. Activist Leann Villaluz is leading a petition drive to put the map to a voter referendum, with the group People Not Politicians Missouri aiming to collect over 106,000 signatures by December 11. Despite pushback from state officials, the group has already gathered over 100,000 signatures and is continuing its efforts. The Democratic National Committee has joined the referendum effort, contributing staff and funds. Lawmakers like Michael Davis support the map, arguing it sends a conservative message to D.C., while others, like Republican Rep. Bill Allen, oppose mid-decade redistricting. Villaluz and other activists plan to keep gathering signatures, believing Missouri voters will ultimately decide the map's fate.
