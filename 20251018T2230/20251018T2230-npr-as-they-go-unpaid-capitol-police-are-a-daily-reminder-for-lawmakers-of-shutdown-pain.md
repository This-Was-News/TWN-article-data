## Article summary
The ongoing government shutdown has left U.S. Capitol Police officers unpaid, missing their first full paycheck on October 10th. These officers, who protect lawmakers daily, face increasing threats and violence, making their job more challenging. Senator Katie Britt and Representative Joe Morelle have expressed concern for the officers, with Morelle noting the lack of negotiation and the impact on the officers' lives. The Trump administration has proposed repurposing funds to pay federal law enforcement during the shutdown, but Democrats have questioned the legality of this move. Additionally, officers felt disrespected when some GOP lawmakers did not oppose President Trump's pardons of January 6 rioters and a memorial plaque honoring the officers who defended the Capitol remains uninstalled. Despite these challenges, the officers continue to perform their duties professionally, though each slight makes it harder for them to stay motivated. Recently, Rep. Nanette Barragán clashed with an officer, leading to a demand for an apology from the Capitol Police union. The officers are holding up for now, but one expressed concern about their ability to continue if the shutdown persists.
