## Article summary
The Marines are set to fire 155-millimeter artillery shells over a section of Interstate 5 in Southern California on Saturday, as part of a demonstration at Camp Pendleton to mark the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary. The plan sparked outrage from Governor Gavin Newsom, who was initially informed that the celebration would not involve firing munitions over the freeway. In response to the potential hazards, Newsom announced the closure of a 17-mile stretch of the freeway from noon to 3 p.m. Pacific time. The governor criticized the lack of coordination among state, federal, and local officials, and the potential danger to Californians. The event, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, coincides with planned No Kings protests across the country, including in Southern California. Newsom condemned the use of military demonstrations to intimidate political opponents, describing it as reckless and disrespectful.
