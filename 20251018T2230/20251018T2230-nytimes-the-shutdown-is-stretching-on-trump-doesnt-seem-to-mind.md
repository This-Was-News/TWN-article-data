## Article summary
The government shutdown, now in its fourth week, shows no signs of resolution as President Trump seems unconcerned with the impasse. Trump has redirected funds to ensure military and law enforcement salaries are paid, while halting funding to Democratic areas and attempting to lay off federal workers. Unlike previous presidents, Trump appears to be using the shutdown to reshape the federal bureaucracy and eliminate programs he dislikes, employing unconventional budgetary tactics that some consider illegal. Despite criticism and a federal judge's temporary block on mass firings, administration officials, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russell T. Vought, remain committed to their strategies. Democratic leaders, such as Representative Hakeem Jeffries, have vowed not to yield to Trump's pressure tactics, indicating a prolonged standoff. The shutdown, which began on October 1, has not yet inflicted enough pain on Americans to force a compromise, as is typical in such situations.
