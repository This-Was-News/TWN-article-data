## Article summary
The U.S. military attacked a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean Sea, resulting in two survivors who were repatriated to their home countries of Colombia and Ecuador. President Trump announced the decision to return the survivors rather than prosecute them or detain them in the U.S. The attack was part of a series of strikes targeting drug smugglers, which the Trump administration has justified as a formal armed conflict. The survivors were rescued and transferred to the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima before being handed over to the State Department for repatriation. The administration's actions have raised legal and logistical questions, particularly regarding the treatment of suspected drug smugglers as enemy combatants. The decision to repatriate the survivors aligns with the Coast Guard's practice of handing off suspected traffickers to friendly countries. The attack was the sixth known strike by the U.S. military in the region since early September, with previous attacks resulting in the deaths of 29 people. The administration has stressed the severity of the drug crisis, citing high overdose rates, but the primary source of fentanyl is Mexico, not South America. The fate of the two survivors required diplomatic efforts amid a significant military buildup in the region.
