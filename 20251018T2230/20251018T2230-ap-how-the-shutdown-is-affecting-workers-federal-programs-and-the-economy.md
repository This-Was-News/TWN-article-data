## Article summary
The federal government shutdown, nearing the second-longest on record, has significant impacts on workers, federal programs, and the economy. Nearly 750,000 federal employees are furloughed, facing delayed paychecks, while essential services continue. The administration is using the shutdown to push its priorities, including attempting to fire thousands of federal workers, a move temporarily blocked by a judge. The economic impact includes reduced growth, disruptions in travel, and delays in small business loans and real estate transactions. Public opinion is split on who is to blame, with both parties holding firm on their positions. The shutdown has also led to the suspension of funding for key infrastructure and clean energy projects, further complicating the path to resolution.
