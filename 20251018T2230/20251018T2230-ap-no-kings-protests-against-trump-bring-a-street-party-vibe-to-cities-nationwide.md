## Article summary
Protests against President Donald Trump, dubbed 'No Kings' demonstrations, are planned nationwide, with the Republican Party labeling them 'Hate America' rallies. This will be the third and largest mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House, occurring amidst a government shutdown that has closed federal programs and services. The protests aim to challenge Trump's actions, including his administration's clampdown on free speech and military-style immigration raids, which organizers warn could lead to American authoritarianism. Top Democrats, including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Bernie Sanders, are participating, viewing the rallies as a response to Trump's policies. Republicans, however, dismiss the protests as radical and blame them for the prolonged government shutdown, portraying participants as communists and Marxists. Democrats see the shutdown as a way to stand up to Trump and push back against his presidency. The number of rallies has grown significantly since previous protests, indicating a more unified opposition movement.
