## Article summary
President Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean will be sent back to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia. The strike, which occurred on Thursday, targeted a submersible vessel carrying drugs, including fentanyl. Trump confirmed that two individuals were killed in the attack, raising the total number of deaths from such strikes to at least 29 since early September. The president justified the actions by framing them as part of an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, using legal authority similar to that employed during the war on terrorism. The repatriation of the survivors avoids legal questions about their status in the U.S. justice system. Trump had previously highlighted the destruction of the vessel on his social media platform, emphasizing its role in narcotrafficking. The military rescued the survivors after the strike, which was at least the sixth of its kind in recent months. The president's approach treats suspected drug traffickers as enemy combatants in a traditional war, aligning with his broader strategy against drug cartels.
