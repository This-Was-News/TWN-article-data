## Article summary
A military showcase at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance, involved firing live artillery shells over a major Southern California highway, Interstate 5. Governor Gavin Newsom objected, citing safety concerns, and ordered the closure of a 17-mile stretch of the highway. The U.S. Marine officials assured that the exercise was safe and followed established protocols. Despite initial closures, the highway was briefly reopened to ease traffic congestion. The closure caused significant delays and economic impact, with the freeway carrying 80,000 travelers and $94 million in freight daily. Vance's spokesperson criticized Newsom's stance, asserting the importance of military training exercises. The event was part of the Marine Corps' 250th-anniversary celebrations, featuring amphibious vehicles and beach assault demonstrations. The California Highway Patrol managed the closures and reopenings to manage traffic flow. The state had considered earlier closures but decided based on practice firings and safety protocols.
