## Article summary
Democratic U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill has won the New Jersey governor's race, defeating Republican Jack Ciattarelli. This victory marks a significant win for Democrats, being the second major win for the party on Tuesday following Abigail Spanberger's victory in Virginia. Sherrill's election signifies the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey has elected a governor from the same party for three consecutive terms. The gubernatorial race was closely watched, with some polls predicting a tight contest, and it was one of the first statewide votes since President Trump began his second term, having endorsed Ciattarelli. Despite New Jersey being a traditionally blue state with a Democratic governor for eight years and a Democratic-controlled legislature, the possibility of a Republican flip and the election's potential as an indicator of public opinion on Trump's presidency drew significant national attention and nearly $200 million in spending. Both candidates, Sherrill and Ciattarelli, focused on the issue of affordability, with Ciattarelli promising to lower property taxes and Sherrill pledging to freeze electricity bills. The final weeks of the campaign were marked by personal attacks, including Ciattarelli questioning Sherrill's past at the Naval Academy and Sherrill accusing Ciattarelli's former company of producing materials that downplayed opioid dangers.
