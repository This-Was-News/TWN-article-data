## Article summary
Dick Cheney, as vice president during the George W. Bush administration, became a central figure in the expansion of U.S. surveillance powers and executive authority in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. He was a strong advocate for the Patriot Act, which granted the government broad surveillance capabilities, and supported a National Security Agency warrantless wiretapping program. Cheney argued that such measures could have prevented the 9/11 attacks, but critics contend that the security state established then is a direct product of those reactions. The legal justifications for the government's surveillance apparatus have faced judicial scrutiny, and the bipartisan consensus on expanded powers has eroded. Some Republicans now express skepticism, believing these powers were misused to investigate Donald Trump's ties to Russia. Key provisions of the Patriot Act have expired, and programs like Section 702 of FISA have undergone significant debate and negotiation for reauthorization. Cheney also played a role in pushing for intelligence that justified the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, which later proved to be faulty. This reliance on intelligence for political ends has fostered distrust among some Americans. The Trump administration has employed legal doctrines popularized during the Cheney era to justify deadly strikes against drug cartels, classifying them as unlawful combatants. The legacy of the Bush-Cheney administration includes blurring the lines between civilian and military responses to threats and the establishment of new agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and the ODNI, though disputes over agency roles persist.
