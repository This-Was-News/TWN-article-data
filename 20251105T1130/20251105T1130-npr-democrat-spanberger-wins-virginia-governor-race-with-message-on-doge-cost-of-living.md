## Article summary
Democrat Abigail Spanberger has won the Virginia governor's race, becoming the state's first female governor. She defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Spanberger's campaign focused on the economic hardships faced by Virginians due to federal layoffs, tariffs, and a government shutdown, attributing these issues to President Trump's policies. She positioned herself as an advocate for Virginians impacted by these economic challenges. The race was seen as a significant test of voter sentiment following the Trump administration's policies, especially given Virginia's large federal workforce. National Democrats viewed this election as a crucial boost heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with former President Barack Obama campaigning for Spanberger. Earle-Sears, a Jamaican immigrant and former Marine, campaigned on the American dream and raised concerns about transgender rights in school bathrooms. She also criticized Spanberger's support for Biden administration policies and vowed to continue outgoing Governor Youngkin's business-friendly approach. The federal shutdown significantly impacted the final weeks of the campaign. In another key race, Democrat Jay Jones won the attorney general position, which will allow Virginia to join lawsuits against the Trump administration.
