## Article summary
A massive fireball erupted when a UPS cargo plane crashed during takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, killing at least seven people and injuring eleven. The McDonnell Douglas MD-11, which was departing for Honolulu, crashed around 5:15 p.m. Tuesday, with video footage showing flames on its left wing before it lifted slightly and then exploded. Authorities confirmed that four of the deceased were not on the plane, and the death toll is expected to rise. The crash significantly impacted nearby businesses, including Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and an auto parts operation, with debris scattered across residential areas. The UPS Worldport, the company's largest package handling facility, halted operations following the incident. The National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a 28-person team to investigate the crash. While the airport resumed operations Wednesday morning, some flights were canceled, and stranded passengers spent the night. The event caused widespread shock and concern among residents, with many seeking information about loved ones working near the airport.
