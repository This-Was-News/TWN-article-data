## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, has been elected as New York City's 111th mayor, marking a significant shift towards generational and ideological change in the nation's largest city. His victory, a stunning upset that began in the June Democratic primary, saw him decisively defeat former Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and his well-funded super PACs. Mamdani successfully built a broad coalition, uniting younger voters with working-class immigrant communities in Queens, and also made inroads into working-class Black and Latino neighborhoods. The election witnessed an unprecedented surge in voter turnout, with over two million New Yorkers casting ballots, a figure not seen in mayoral elections for half a century. Mamdani became the first candidate since John V. Lindsay in 1969 to surpass one million votes in a New York City mayoral race. This high participation rate approached levels typically seen in presidential elections in certain areas of the city.
