## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani has won the New York City mayoral race, making history as the first Muslim and South Asian person, as well as the youngest in over a century, to hold the position. The 34-year-old Democratic socialist defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani's campaign focused on progressive policies such as fare-free buses, rent freezes, universal childcare, and increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy. His victory is seen as a significant win for progressives and reflects a generational shift within the Democratic Party. Mamdani's supporters, particularly young voters, were energized by his optimistic vision for a more affordable city. The election saw record early-voter turnout, with over two million votes cast in total. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo ran as an Independent, emphasizing public safety and a more centrist stance, while Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, also competed. The race was marked by contentious debates and a high level of voter engagement, highlighting the political stakes for New York City.
