## Article summary
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has proposed a new requirement for Federal Reserve regional bank presidents to reside in their districts for at least three years before taking office. This initiative, discussed at the New York Times DealBook Summit, aims to ensure regional presidents better represent their districts and could potentially increase White House influence over the independent agency. Bessent criticized several current regional presidents for their ties to New York, suggesting a disconnect from the Fed's original structure. He believes the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors could 'veto' appointments that do not meet this proposed residency rule. This move is seen as another attempt by the White House to exert more control over the Fed, an institution traditionally independent from political influence. The Fed's structure includes a Washington-based Board of Governors and 12 regional banks, with all regional presidents participating in interest-rate setting committee meetings. Recent appointments, such as Lorie Logan (Dallas Fed), Alberto Musalem (St. Louis Fed), and Beth Hammack (Cleveland Fed), have been criticized for their New York connections or lack of deep district ties. Bessent argues that regional banks were intended to bring diverse district perspectives to interest rate decisions, countering the perceived dominance of New York. The article also touches upon ongoing political dynamics surrounding Fed appointments, including President Trump's efforts to influence the Board of Governors and potentially replace Chair Jerome Powell.
