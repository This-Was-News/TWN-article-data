## Article summary
A Pentagon watchdog has concluded that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth jeopardized the safety of U.S. forces by discussing sensitive military information, including details about airstrikes against Houthi rebels, on the Signal messaging app. The inspector general's report, expected to be released soon, was initiated after a journalist revealed he was added to a Signal chat where Hegseth and other officials discussed operational plans. The report found that if foreign adversaries had intercepted this intelligence, it would have endangered U.S. servicemembers and the mission. Hegseth violated Pentagon policies by using personal phones for official business and shared information about targets, timing, and aircraft with two Signal groups, including his wife and brother. He declined an interview with investigators, providing only a written response and claiming the investigation was political. The Pentagon spokesperson stated the review fully exonerated Hegseth, asserting no classified information was shared and the matter is resolved. The White House also defended the national security team, emphasizing that operational security was not compromised. The investigation relied partly on screenshots from The Atlantic, as Hegseth provided limited Signal messages. Some members of the Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concern over the use of unsecure apps for sharing such sensitive information. This report emerges amid other controversies surrounding Hegseth's leadership and decisions at the Pentagon.
