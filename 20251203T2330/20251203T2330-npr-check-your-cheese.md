## Article summary
Two separate cheese recalls have been issued nationwide, affecting hundreds of thousands of containers of shredded mozzarella and cheese blends, as well as several brands of grated Pecorino Romano. The shredded cheese recall, initiated by Great Lakes Cheese, involves products sold at major retailers like Aldi, Target, and Walmart due to potential metal fragments. This recall has been classified as Class II by the FDA, indicating a risk of temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences. The affected shredded cheeses include various types of mozzarella and cheese blends with sell-by dates in February and March 2026, distributed across 31 states and Puerto Rico. The Pecorino Romano recall, announced by The Ambriola Company, is due to the confirmed presence of listeria, a bacteria that can cause serious infections. While no illnesses have been reported, the recall is a precautionary measure. Affected Pecorino Romano products are sold under brands such as Ambriola, Locatelli, and Boar's Head, with expiration dates ranging from February to May 2026. Walmart and Wegmans have confirmed that some of these recalled products were sold at their locations. The FDA advises consumers to discard the recalled cheeses or return them for a refund and to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of listeria infection. Ambriola has suspended production of affected products pending a review of its safety procedures.
