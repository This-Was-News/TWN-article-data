## Article summary
A federal vaccine advisory committee is set to discuss potentially changing the recommendation for newborns to receive the hepatitis B vaccine within their first day of life. This vaccine, the first found to prevent cancer, has been a public health success, significantly reducing pediatric hepatitis B infections over the past three decades. Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that can lead to liver failure and cancer, especially in infants who are at high risk of chronic infection. The current recommendation for a birth dose was implemented in 1991 to ensure all babies were protected, as screening expectant mothers was insufficient and the virus can be transmitted easily. Concerns have been raised by some committee members about administering a vaccine so early in life, with one member citing "trust" and parental "discomfort" as reasons for re-evaluation, rather than safety concerns. A recent analysis suggests that delaying the birth dose could lead to thousands of new infections and hundreds of deaths. While a change in recommendation might not significantly impact hospital practices, it could cause confusion and fear among parents. Several public health organizations and government officials have voiced strong opposition to altering the current guidelines, with one senator calling it a "heartless choice to allow babies to die." The committee's decision is anticipated following a previous tabling of the vote.
