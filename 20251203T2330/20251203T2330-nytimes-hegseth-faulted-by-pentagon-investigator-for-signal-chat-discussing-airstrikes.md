## Article summary
Two repatriation flights carrying hundreds of Venezuelan migrants arrived in Venezuela, marking a rare instance of cooperation between the U.S. and Venezuela amidst ongoing tensions. These flights occurred despite President Trump's recent declaration of a closure of Venezuelan airspace, which the Venezuelan government initially interpreted as a halt to such operations. Communication between the governments facilitated the return of these individuals, with Venezuela's foreign minister assuring the safety of air travel. The flights brought back Venezuelans who were in Mexico and others deported from the U.S. While Venezuela has been accepting repatriation flights, relations remain strained due to U.S. military strikes targeting suspected drug boats in international waters. The U.S. administration claims these strikes are part of an armed conflict with drug cartels, but legal experts question their legality, particularly concerning civilian casualties. The scrutiny on earlier strikes is leading to high-level questioning on Capitol Hill.
