## Article summary
The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is holding a critical meeting to re-evaluate the childhood vaccination schedule. This comes after a change in committee membership, leading to concerns among public health experts about a potential erosion of trust in vaccines and a resurgence of preventable diseases. A key proposed change involves reconsidering the universal hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, with some advocating for a delay or a more targeted approach. However, analysis suggests delaying this vaccine could lead to significant healthcare costs and preventable deaths. The committee is also scrutinizing other aspects of the schedule, including the MMR vaccine and the use of aluminum adjuvants, which enhance vaccine effectiveness. While critics raise concerns about aluminum's safety, public health experts maintain it is safe and essential for vaccine efficacy. The CDC's recent shift in stance on the vaccine-autism link has further complicated the situation, prompting independent medical groups to issue their own recommendations. The ongoing debate highlights the tension between evolving scientific understanding, public perception, and the established efficacy of long-used vaccines in protecting children's health.
