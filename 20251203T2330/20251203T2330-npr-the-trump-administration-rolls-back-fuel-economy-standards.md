## Article summary
The Trump administration has initiated the process to significantly relax fuel economy requirements for new vehicles, marking a shift away from cleaner car policies. President Trump announced the termination of the Biden-era Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, asserting that the changes would lower car prices and save consumers money. However, previous research has questioned the argument that regulations increase car costs. The CAFE standards require automakers' vehicle fleets to become progressively more fuel-efficient, with penalties for non-compliance. The Trump administration had previously weakened these standards by eliminating fines and is now proposing to revert to the 2022 baseline, with only a 0.5% annual increase instead of the previous 2% annual increase. This proposed change is subject to a public comment period. Concurrently, the administration is rolling back tailpipe emission standards and Congress has eliminated consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Trump had pledged to rescind policies that encouraged electric vehicles, framing the rollback as beneficial to the auto industry by allowing the sale of more profitable, less efficient vehicles like trucks and SUVs. While some automakers, like Ford, have praised the alignment with market realities, the fluctuating regulations create uncertainty for long-term planning and competition in a global market increasingly focused on climate action and the rise of Chinese EVs.
