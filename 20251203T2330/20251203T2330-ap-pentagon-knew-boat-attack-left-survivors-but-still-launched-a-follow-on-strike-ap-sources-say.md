## Article summary
The Pentagon was aware that survivors were present after an initial strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea, yet a follow-on strike was still executed. This second strike was justified by officials as necessary to sink the vessel, despite claims that all 11 individuals aboard perished. Questions remain regarding who authorized these strikes and the extent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's involvement. These details are becoming critical as congressional investigations scrutinize the legality of U.S. military operations. Admiral Frank Mitch Bradley, who reportedly ordered the second strike, is expected to brief Congress. Hegseth has defended the action, citing the "fog of war" and stating he did not personally witness any survivors. He also asserted that Bradley, as the commanding admiral, had the authority to make the decision. The Trump administration has declared an armed conflict with drug cartels, though Congress has not authorized military force in the region. Information about the follow-on strike was not initially shared with lawmakers, and the subsequent explanations have been deemed unsatisfactory. Both the House and Senate Armed Services committees have launched bipartisan investigations into the strikes.
