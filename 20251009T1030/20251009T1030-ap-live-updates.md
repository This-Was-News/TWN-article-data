## Article summary
Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, which includes a pause in fighting to facilitate the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The agreement has been welcomed by the families of hostages and various international leaders, including Argentine President Javier Milei, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun, and Saudi Arabia. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to convene his Security Cabinet to approve the ceasefire, with both the ceasefire deal and the release of prisoners expected to pass with wide margins. The agreement marks a significant breakthrough in the devastating two-year-old war that has resulted in tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza. While there is skepticism among some Palestinians due to previous failed attempts at ceasefires, there is also hope that this deal will bring relief and an end to the suffering. Observant Jews in Jerusalem celebrated the announcement during the holiday of Sukkot, seeing it as a divine intervention. The deal follows two previous ceasefires in November 2023 and January-February 2025, which broke down after some progress was made in hostage exchanges.
