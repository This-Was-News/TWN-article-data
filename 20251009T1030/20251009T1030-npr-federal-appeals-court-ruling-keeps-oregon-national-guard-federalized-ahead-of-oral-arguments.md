## Article summary
A federal appeals court ruling allows Oregon National Guard troops to remain under federal control but prevents their deployment in Portland. The court issued a temporary stay, preserving the status quo where troops are federalized but not deployed. Oral arguments on the matter are scheduled for Thursday. The ruling does not change the current situation, as a second order still bars any federalized Guard members from being deployed in Oregon. The panel of judges includes two Trump appointees and one Clinton appointee. Governor Tina Kotek attempted to send the Guard members home, but the ruling prevents this. The legal battle follows Trump's announcement to deploy Oregon National Guard members, which was immediately challenged by the state and city of Portland. Protests against immigration enforcement in Portland have been characterized differently by the Trump administration and local authorities. The court's decision aims to maintain the current situation while the legal process continues.
