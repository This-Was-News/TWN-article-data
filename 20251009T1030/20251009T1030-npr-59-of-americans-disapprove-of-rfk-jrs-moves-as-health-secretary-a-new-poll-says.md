## Article summary
A new poll reveals a significant partisan divide in trust towards Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with Republicans trusting him as much as their own doctors, while Democrats and Independents largely disapprove. The poll also highlights the growing influence of political beliefs on health-related opinions, as seen in the differing reactions to President Trump's statements about acetaminophen and autism. While there is no scientific evidence linking acetaminophen to autism, Trump's warning led to a stark contrast in beliefs between Democrats and Republicans. The poll also indicates a decline in trust in the CDC among Democrats, particularly regarding vaccine information. Overall, the poll suggests that people's health decisions are increasingly influenced by their political affiliations, with Democrats trusting professional medical groups more than Republicans. This fragmentation in public health sources is expected to have a significant impact on health-related decisions.
