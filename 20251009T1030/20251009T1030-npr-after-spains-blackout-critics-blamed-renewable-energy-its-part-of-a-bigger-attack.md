## Article summary
A massive power outage in Spain, Portugal, and part of France in spring 2025 was initially blamed on renewable energy sources like solar and wind. However, a new report from a European grid operators' expert panel contradicts this narrative, finding that a voltage surge, not an overreliance on renewables, caused the outage. The report details a series of events leading to the blackout, including power oscillations and subsequent voltage surges that triggered transformer and power plant shutdowns. Despite the findings, misinformation about renewable energy's role persisted, with a survey showing a majority of Spanish respondents believing false narratives about the blackout. Critics of renewable energy often cite inertia as a concern, but the report and other analyses found no evidence that inertia issues caused the outage. The incident highlights broader attacks on renewable energy, with similar false claims made during a 2021 Texas blackout. Experts emphasize that renewable energy, when paired with large batteries or other grid management tools, can be reliable and is crucial for moving away from polluting fossil fuels. California's successful use of solar plus batteries demonstrates the potential of renewable energy to prevent blackouts, even during extreme weather conditions.
