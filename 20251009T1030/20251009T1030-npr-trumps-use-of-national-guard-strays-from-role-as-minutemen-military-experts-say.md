## Article summary
The National Guard has been deployed in various ways under President Trump's administration, including patrolling streets, assisting ICE operations, and participating in beautification projects. While these tasks have drawn attention, military experts argue they stray from the Guard's core missions, such as aiding during natural disasters and emergencies. The Guard's history dates back to the 1600s, with roots in citizen-soldiers known as 'minutemen.' Experts express concerns about the impact of these deployments on recruitment, public trust, and the well-being of Guard members and their families. The adaptability of the Guard is often compared to a 'Swiss Army knife,' but there are warnings against taking advantage of their versatility. Retired military leaders worry about the potential long-term effects of these deployments on the relationship between the American people and the military.
