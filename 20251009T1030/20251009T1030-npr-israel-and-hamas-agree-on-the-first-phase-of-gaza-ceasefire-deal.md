## Article summary
Israel and Hamas have agreed to the 'first phase' of a ceasefire deal to end the Gaza war, which has been the deadliest conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The agreement was signed in Cairo after negotiations brokered by President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and other mediators. The ceasefire calls for an immediate end to fighting, the release of 48 hostages by Hamas, and the freeing of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners by Israel. The deal also outlines Israel's troop withdrawal and Hamas's disarmament, though details and timelines remain unclear. The agreement has garnered widespread support, but its success is not guaranteed. The war began with a Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, leading to significant casualties and destruction in Gaza. The ceasefire aims to address immediate humanitarian needs and pave the way for long-term peace and reconstruction, though the path to Palestinian statehood remains vague.
