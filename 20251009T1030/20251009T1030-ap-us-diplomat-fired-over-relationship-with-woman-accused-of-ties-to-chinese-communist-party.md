## Article summary
The State Department has fired a U.S. diplomat for violating a ban on romantic relationships with Chinese nationals, introduced last year. The diplomat admitted to concealing a relationship with a woman alleged to have ties to the Chinese Communist Party. This is believed to be the first dismissal under the new policy, which applies to U.S. personnel in China and their family members. The diplomat was identified in a video posted by conservative activist James O'Keefe. Under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the department maintains a zero-tolerance policy for actions undermining national security. The Chinese government declined to comment, opposing ideological lines and smearing. The ban was imposed during the Biden administration's final days. The diplomat's case was reviewed by President Donald Trump and Secretary Rubio. The dismissed diplomat's identity was not disclosed in the official statement.
