## Article summary
President Trump is on the verge of achieving a significant diplomatic success by brokering a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. This accomplishment would solidify his reputation as a deal maker and peacemaker, potentially earning him the Nobel Peace Prize. The cease-fire and hostage release, if successful, would mark a major step towards peace in the region. Trump's pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu has been crucial in advancing the deal. The Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, was a notable achievement of Trump's first term. The current conflict has caused immense destruction and loss of life, with over 60,000 Palestinians and 1,200 Israelis killed. Netanyahu's aggressive military actions have isolated Israel and damaged its global standing. The cease-fire deal involves hostage-for-prisoner swaps and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. However, the long-term success of the peace plan remains uncertain, as Hamas and Netanyahu may resist further concessions. The region's history suggests that conflicts often recur, making lasting peace challenging.
