## Article summary
Lawmakers are struggling to end the government shutdown due to a lack of trust between parties. President Trump and Republicans demand Democrats vote to reopen the government before negotiating on health care benefits, while Democrats insist on safeguards due to distrust of Trump. The shutdown has led to government office closures and threatened federal employees' pay. Conflicts over spending power and executive overreach have further complicated negotiations. Democrats want an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and limits on the White House's ability to rescind approved funding. Republicans have been open to discussing these safeguards. The main sticking point remains the health care subsidies extension. Lawmakers are concerned about the financial implications for federal employees, especially military troops who may miss a paycheck. Republicans have passed a stopgap bill to ensure federal workers are paid, but Democrats have not voted for it. The shutdown continues with no significant progress, and lawmakers are preparing for potential political blowback.
