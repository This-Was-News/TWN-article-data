## Article summary
A 29-year-old man, Jonathan Rinderknecht, has been charged with starting the Palisades Fire, one of the most destructive wildfires in Los Angeles history. The fire, which began on New Year's Day and reignited on January 7, killed 12 people and destroyed numerous homes and buildings. Rinderknecht was arrested in Florida and faces charges including malicious destruction by means of fire. Investigators allege he started the fire after dropping off an Uber passenger and later returned to watch it burn. The Los Angeles Fire Department released a report criticizing their response, citing lack of resources and communication issues. The fire was a holdover from an earlier blaze that was not fully extinguished. Investigators found a lighter in Rinderknecht's car, which he admitted to bringing with him. The Palisades Fire was one of two major blazes that day, with the Eaton Fire also causing significant destruction. Both fires highlighted systemic issues in emergency response and evacuation procedures.
