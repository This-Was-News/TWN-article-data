## Article summary
The Pentagon has accepted a $130 million anonymous donation to help pay military members during the government shutdown. President Trump disclosed the gift, calling the donor a patriot, though the individual's identity remains undisclosed. While significant, this donation covers only a small fraction of the billions required for service member paychecks. The Trump administration previously shifted $6.5 billion from military research funds to cover payroll, and it remains uncertain if they can do so again. This unprecedented acceptance of a private donation for military pay has raised ethical and legal questions. Experts worry about the implications of treating service member compensation as a private debt. Pentagon policy requires consultation with ethics officials for gifts over $10,000 to assess potential conflicts of interest. The government shutdown, now in its 24th day, is a stalemate over healthcare funding, with neither party willing to concede. The payment for service members has become a critical concern and a point of political leverage amidst the ongoing closure.
