## Article summary
The U.S. military has conducted multiple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, signaling an expansion of the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the strikes, stating that cartels are waging war on the U.S. border and its people. However, the administration has not provided public evidence to support its claims about the individuals on the boats and the drugs they allegedly carried, raising concerns about the legality and goals of these operations. The deployment of significant military hardware to the region has led international law experts to question whether the operation is genuinely about countering narcotics or aimed at toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. President Trump asserts he has the legal authority to launch these attacks as a national security issue, and he indicated potential future strikes on land. While Trump believes lawmakers will support these efforts, he does not intend to seek a declaration of war, stating the U.S. will simply "kill people that are bringing drugs into our country." Lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns that the strikes may violate domestic and international laws, with some calling it a "shoot first, ask questions later" precedent. Legal experts argue the administration's justification, based on Article II powers and an "armed attack" by nonstate actors, is insufficient and amounts to "premeditated killing" outside of armed conflict. Colombia has accused the U.S. of murder, claiming some strikes killed Colombians, prompting Trump to announce a halt to aid payments to Colombia. United Nations experts have stated that lethal force in international waters without a proper legal basis violates international law and amounts to extrajudicial executions.
