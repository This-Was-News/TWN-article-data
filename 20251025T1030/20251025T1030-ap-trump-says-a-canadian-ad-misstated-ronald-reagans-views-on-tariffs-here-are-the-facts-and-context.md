## Article summary
President Donald Trump withdrew from trade talks with Canada after becoming angered by a provincial ad that featured Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. The ad used audio from a 1987 radio address where Reagan stated that trade barriers hurt American workers and consumers. Trump accused Canada of fraudulently misrepresenting Reagan's views, claiming the former president actually "loved tariffs." However, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute noted the ad misrepresented Reagan's speech. While Reagan did impose tariffs on Japanese semiconductors and motorcycles, he generally spoke against protectionist measures, warning of retaliation and trade wars. His policies were complex, including pressuring other countries to devalue their currencies to boost American exports. Some analysts, like a Cato Institute member, even labeled Reagan the most protectionist president since Herbert Hoover. Reagan described imposing tariffs as a last resort, stating he was "loath to take" such actions. In contrast, Trump enthusiastically employs tariffs, viewing them as a tool to protect American industry and generate revenue. The average U.S. tariff rate has significantly increased under Trump's administration, leading to legal challenges over his authority to impose such taxes.
