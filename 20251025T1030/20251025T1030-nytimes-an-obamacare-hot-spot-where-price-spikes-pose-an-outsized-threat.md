## Article summary
South Florida is poised to experience the most significant impact if enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, implemented during the pandemic, expire at the end of the year. An estimated third of Florida's 4.7 million ACA plan enrollees could lose their coverage due to increased costs. The state's demographics, including a large population of low-wage workers, self-employed individuals, and early retirees, contribute to its high demand for ACA plans. Florida's status as one of the states that has not expanded Medicaid further exacerbates the situation. The expiration of these subsidies, a result of partisan disagreements, is bringing the ACA back into political discussion in Florida, a state that has shifted politically since the law's inception. Democrats are raising alarms about impending premium hikes, while some Republicans question the value of comprehensive coverage versus lower costs. The enhanced subsidies have significantly lowered premiums for many, with some paying as little as $50 a month, but without them, costs could skyrocket to over $1,000 monthly for individuals in their early 60s. Many Floridians who would benefit from Medicaid expansion are unable to access it due to the state's political stance. The number of ACA enrollees in Florida has doubled since 2021, highlighting the reliance on these subsidies for affordable coverage. Residents are expressing deep concern about the potential loss of coverage, fearing it will impact their ability to care for themselves and their families.
