## Article summary
The U.S. military is deploying the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to South America, escalating military presence in the region. This move, announced by the Pentagon, aims to enhance the U.S. capacity to disrupt illicit activities. The deployment follows a series of rapid U.S. strikes against suspected drug-running boats, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowing to hunt down and eliminate drug traffickers. These strikes have intensified, increasing in frequency and expanding to new areas, resulting in numerous fatalities. The U.S. has also imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro and his associates over alleged drug trade involvement. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro views these U.S. operations as an attempt to oust him and has mobilized his country's defenses. Analysts suggest the U.S. military buildup is a message to regional countries to align with U.S. interests, with drug trafficking serving as a pretext. President Trump has compared the crackdown on drug cartels to the war on terrorism, declaring an "armed conflict" with them. However, concerns have been raised by lawmakers regarding the lack of congressional authorization and transparency surrounding these military actions.
