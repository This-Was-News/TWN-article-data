## Article summary
A federal government shutdown is threatening to cut off or disrupt food aid for approximately 42 million Americans through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). SNAP, the nation's largest anti-hunger program, provides crucial financial assistance to vulnerable populations including children, working individuals, the elderly, veterans, and people with disabilities. For many, SNAP is the only direct financial support they receive to cover basic monthly expenses. The program is also vital for keeping tens of millions of Americans financially stable each month. In addition to SNAP, a nutrition program serving 7 million pregnant women and new parents is also at risk. The Department of Agriculture has warned that SNAP funding could run out by November 1, with payments currently on hold. This situation is a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats linking a shutdown resolution to extending Affordable Care Act tax credits. Advocates argue that the USDA has the means and legal obligation to continue funding SNAP, citing existing reserves and the program's entitlement status. If funding lapses, it would mark an unprecedented situation in the U.S., potentially leading to widespread hunger not seen since the Great Depression. The shutdown also coincides with new work requirements that could push millions off the program. States are bracing for increased demand at food banks, though charity is unlikely to fully compensate for the loss of federal funding. Recipients like Shari Jablonowski are already struggling and fear severe hardship, including potential loss of heat and inability to afford necessities, if their benefits disappear.
