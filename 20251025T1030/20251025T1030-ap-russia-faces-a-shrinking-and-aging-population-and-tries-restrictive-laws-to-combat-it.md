## Article summary
Russia is grappling with a persistent demographic crisis characterized by a shrinking and aging population, a challenge President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged for over two decades. Despite initiatives like financial incentives and symbolic holidays aimed at boosting birth rates, the number of births has declined significantly since a 2015 peak. Factors contributing to this decline include economic uncertainty, the ongoing war in Ukraine, emigration of young men, and a historical demographic deficit stemming from World War II and the Soviet Union's collapse. In response, Russia has implemented restrictive laws, including bans on promoting abortion and LGBTQ+ activism, aligning with a push for "traditional family values." These measures, however, are criticized for potentially harming women's health and limiting freedoms, with concerns that they may lead to an increase in unsafe, illegal abortions. The country's population has fallen, and the proportion of elderly citizens has risen. Efforts to increase the population through immigration are unlikely, as Russia has recently fostered anti-migrant sentiment. The ongoing war and lack of future confidence further discourage potential parents, making it difficult for Russia to reverse its demographic trajectory.
