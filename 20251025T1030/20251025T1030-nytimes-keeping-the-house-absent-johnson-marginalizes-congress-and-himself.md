## Article summary
Speaker Mike Johnson has placed the House of Representatives on an indefinite hiatus, which has now extended for over a month during a government shutdown. This decision has diminished the role of Congress and the speakership itself, a move that has far-reaching consequences for an institution already largely subordinate to President Trump. Johnson's strategy involves keeping the House out of session, a tactic enabled by a rule change in 2023 that allows the speaker unilateral power over extended recesses. This approach is seen by some as a strategic calculation to maintain control over his party's rank and file by preventing them from engaging in legislative debates or taking potentially conflicting stances. Critics, including Democrats and some Republicans, argue that this inaction is detrimental to the legislative process and undermines the House's constitutional responsibilities. Johnson has largely remained silent on the shutdown, deferring to Trump's directives and defending his actions, even on controversial matters. This deference has led to accusations that Trump has effectively abolished the House, with minority leader Hakeem Jeffries stating that Republicans act only with Trump's permission. Some observers worry that this period of legislative inactivity could permanently alter the understanding of the House's function for newer members. Johnson's continued role as a defender of Trump's actions, even those widely criticized, highlights a significant shift in his political stance since 2015.
