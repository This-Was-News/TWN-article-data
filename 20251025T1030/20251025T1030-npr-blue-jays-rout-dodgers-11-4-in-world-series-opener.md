## Article summary
The Toronto Blue Jays routed the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4 in Game 1 of the World Series, powered by a historic pinch-hit grand slam from Addison Barger and a two-run homer by Alejandro Kirk. Daulton Varsho ignited Toronto's comeback with a two-run homer in the fourth inning, breaking a 2-0 deficit. The Blue Jays' offense exploded for nine runs in the sixth inning, featuring a tiebreaking single from Ernie Clement and a bases-loaded walk. Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run homer for the Dodgers, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Blue Jays' offensive onslaught. The game marked the World Series' return to Toronto for the first time since 1993. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed disappointment with his team's pitching, stating they "didn't make pitches when we need to." Game 2 is scheduled for Saturday night, with Yoshinobu Yamamoto set to pitch for the Dodgers and Kevin Gausman for the Blue Jays.
