## Article summary
President Trump's plans for remodeling the East Wing of the White House, including its ballroom, have been subject to frequent changes and inconsistencies. The East Wing was recently demolished, with construction slated to begin in September, and is expected to be completed before the end of Trump's term at a cost of $300 million. The capacity of the ballroom has varied in different proposals, ranging from 650 to 1,350 people. Architectural details, such as the number and placement of windows, columns on the portico, and the design of staircases leading to the ballroom, have also differed between initial drawings and later presentations by Trump. While White House officials acknowledge the evolving nature of the project, architects and historians note that Trump's renovation process deviates from typical White House procedures, which usually involve reviews by planning commissions. The hurried nature of the process is also suggested by apparent mistakes in the physical model Trump has displayed, such as a staircase leading to an unclear landing.
