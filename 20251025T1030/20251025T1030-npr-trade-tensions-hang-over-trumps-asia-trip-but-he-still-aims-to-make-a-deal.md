## Article summary
President Trump is embarking on a nearly week-long trip to Asia, with a key focus on trade relations and diplomatic engagements. The agenda includes meetings with leaders in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, alongside a high-stakes encounter with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the APEC summit. Trump aims to finalize trade agreements with Japan and Korea, despite ongoing domestic issues like a government shutdown. A significant event will be Trump presiding over a peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, an achievement he has previously highlighted. In South Korea, he will meet President Lee Jae Myung, discussing trade and potentially North Korea, with Trump expressing openness to dialogue with Kim Jong Un. The trip also involves meeting Japan's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. The meeting with Xi Jinping is overshadowed by escalating trade tensions and China's recent restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, leading Trump to previously threaten canceling the meeting and increasing tariffs. Despite these challenges, Trump maintains optimism about securing a "fantastic" deal with China, though experts suggest the meeting may primarily serve to extend a trade truce rather than resolve core issues.
