## Article summary
A major NBA sports betting scandal has led to the arrest of prominent figures, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, and former player/coach Damon Jones. Billups is accused of conspiring to fix high-stakes card games tied to organized crime, defrauding gamblers of at least $7 million. Rozier allegedly used private player information to gain an advantage in betting on NBA games. Jones is implicated in both schemes. These charges emerged during the opening week of the new NBA season, a period marked by growing storylines and the league's increasing involvement with legalized sports betting. Sports betting has become a significant industry, with revenue generated through online platforms and apps, and its legalization has expanded across 38 states since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling. However, public opinion is divided, with a significant portion of adults viewing the rise of sports betting negatively. The scandal echoes historical betting controversies in professional sports, such as the 1919 Chicago White Sox incident and the 2008 NBA referee Tim Donaghy case, highlighting a long-standing connection between gambling and professional athletics.
