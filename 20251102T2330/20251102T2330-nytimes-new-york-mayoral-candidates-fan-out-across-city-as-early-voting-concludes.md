## Article summary
As early voting concludes in New York City's mayoral race, candidates Zohran Mamdani, Andrew M. Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa are making final appeals to voters across the city. Mamdani and Cuomo, the front-runner and an independent candidate respectively, focused on engaging Black voters early in the day, while Sliwa, the Republican nominee, campaigned in Brooklyn. The race has seen a significant surge in early voting turnout compared to previous elections, indicating heightened public interest. Mamdani, who emerged as the front-runner after a primary win, faces criticism from Cuomo, who questions his experience and suitability for the role. Mamdani, in turn, accuses Cuomo of running a campaign of hate and division. Both candidates engaged with church congregations and volunteers for last-minute get-out-the-vote efforts. The campaign has also been marked by attacks on Mamdani's ethnicity and faith, and divisions within the Jewish community regarding his candidacy and the normalization of anti-Zionist rhetoric. Governor Kathy Hochul has publicly supported Mamdani, contrasting with some Democratic leaders' reservations. The age demographic of early voters is a key factor, with younger voters showing increased participation, potentially benefiting Mamdani. Sliwa continues his campaign, vowing to oppose any Mamdani initiatives not supported by Republican neighborhoods and criticizing Cuomo's potential move to Florida if Mamdani wins. Election Day is Tuesday, with polls open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.
