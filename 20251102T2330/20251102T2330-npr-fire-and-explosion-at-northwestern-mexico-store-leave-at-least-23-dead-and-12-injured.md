## Article summary
A devastating fire and explosion at a Waldo's convenience store in Hermosillo, Sonora state, Mexico, resulted in the tragic deaths of at least 23 people, including children, and left 12 others injured. The incident occurred on Saturday in the downtown area. As of Sunday morning, six individuals remained hospitalized. Preliminary investigations suggest that the inhalation of toxic gases was the primary cause of the fatalities. While images circulating on social media depict the store engulfed in flames, the exact cause of the fire is still under investigation, though authorities suspect it may have originated in a transformer. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed her condolences and pledged support from the federal government, instructing the Interior Secretary to assist victims' families and the injured. The store, Waldo's, has also issued a statement mourning the loss of life and confirming their cooperation with the ongoing investigation.
