## Article summary
The mayor of Uruapan, Mexico, Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez, was shot and killed during Day of the Dead celebrations in the town's historic center. The attack, which occurred Saturday night, also injured a city council member and a bodyguard. The assailant was killed at the scene, and the weapon used was linked to rival criminal groups operating in the violent state of Michoacan. Hundreds of Uruapan residents marched in a funeral procession, chanting for justice and demanding the removal of the ruling party. The slain mayor had previously appealed to President Claudia Sheinbaum for help against cartels and accused state officials of corruption. Manzo Rodríguez, who had been under protection since December 2024, was known for his tough stance on crime and had won office as an independent. His killing follows other recent violence against local officials in Michoacan, including the death of another mayor in June and a journalist in October 2024.
