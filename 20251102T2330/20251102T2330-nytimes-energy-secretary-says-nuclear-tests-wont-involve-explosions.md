## Article summary
President Trump has ordered the U.S. military to resume nuclear testing, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that these tests will involve "systems tests" and "noncritical explosions," not actual nuclear explosions. This clarification comes as the U.S. seeks to modernize its nuclear arsenal, a program estimated to cost $1.7 trillion over three decades. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has created a mock social media page for Democrats as the government shutdown enters its fifth week, impacting services like food stamps and federal employee pay. A federal court has ordered the government to continue funding food stamps, offering two options for payment to avoid hardship for recipients. In other news, Dr. George Tidmarsh, head of the FDA's drug division, was placed on administrative leave after raising concerns about the legal basis of a new rapid drug approval program, which he believes injects politics into scientific decisions. President Trump also threatened Nigeria with potential military action and aid cuts, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians, a claim Nigeria denies. The U.S. military has conducted at least 15 strikes on vessels in the Caribbean, which the administration claims are used for drug smuggling, though critics question the legality of targeting civilians. Air travel is expected to worsen due to air traffic controller shortages caused by the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump also remained non-committal when asked about defending Taiwan if invaded by China, stating, "You'll find out if it happens."
