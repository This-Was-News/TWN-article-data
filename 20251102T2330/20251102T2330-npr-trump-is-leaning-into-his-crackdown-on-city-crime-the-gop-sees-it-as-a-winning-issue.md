## Article summary
President Trump is escalating his crackdown on city crime, threatening to deploy more than just the National Guard to combat what he describes as a nationwide issue. This initiative, which began with a focus on Washington, D.C., has expanded to cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, and Portland, Oregon. The White House frames this as a national campaign to position Trump and Republicans as tough on crime, while accusing Democrats of being lenient. Despite some protests and lawsuits, Trump views this issue as a winning strategy for the upcoming midterm elections, believing it resonates more strongly with voters than inflation or trade. Political data suggests a significant portion of Americans perceive crime as rising, even though FBI statistics indicate a decrease. While a majority oppose the use of federal troops to fight domestic crime, this opposition is largely divided along party lines, with Republicans strongly supporting the deployment. Trump's strategy taps into a fundamental quality-of-life concern for many Americans, who base their perceptions on their lived experiences rather than statistics. This approach aligns with the Republican party's historical emphasis on law and order, with Trump uniquely leveraging the deployment of troops in cities to fulfill a promise to his base.
