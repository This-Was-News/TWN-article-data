## Article summary
President Donald Trump stated that Chinese President Xi Jinping assured him that China would not take military action towards Taiwan during Trump's term. This assurance was reportedly given in discussions that primarily focused on U.S.-China trade tensions, although Trump expressed strong certainty about China's inaction on Taiwan. U.S. officials have historically been concerned about potential Chinese military action against Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. The U.S. policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, mandates ensuring Taiwan's self-defense capabilities and preventing unilateral changes to its status, without explicitly requiring military intervention. When questioned about a potential U.S. military response to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, Trump remained non-committal, reflecting the long-standing U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity. The Chinese embassy spokesperson did not directly confirm Trump's claims about assurances but reiterated that Taiwan is an internal affair and that China will prevent its separation. The White House also did not offer further details on when such assurances might have been conveyed. The interview with Trump was taped at his Florida resort and is part of a broader interview scheduled to air later.
