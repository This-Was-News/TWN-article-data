## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman, is the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, but his candidacy faces scrutiny over his relatively thin résumé. Despite a progressive agenda and a diverse base of support, many voters, including some of his backers, harbor reservations about his readiness to lead the nation's largest city. His youth and energy are appealing to some, especially in a political climate demanding generational change. However, concerns about his lack of extensive administrative and political experience persist, with polls indicating a significant portion of voters doubt his qualifications. Opponent Andrew Cuomo has capitalized on this, emphasizing his own experience while criticizing Mamdani's potential inexperience. Mamdani argues that his campaign's scale demonstrates managerial prowess and has pledged to surround himself with seasoned experts. While some voters trust his instincts and communication skills, others worry about his ability to handle the city's complex challenges and vast budget. The election's outcome will determine who takes control of a city facing high living costs and potential federal funding threats. Ultimately, the decision for many voters involves weighing Mamdani's progressive vision against concerns about his résumé, with some households divided on the issue.
