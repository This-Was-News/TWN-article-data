## Article summary
A violent confrontation occurred in Evanston, Illinois, after a car crash involving a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle escalated into a physical arrest captured on video. The incident, which involved federal immigration agents arresting three individuals, drew a crowd of onlookers and led to agents deploying pepper spray and pointing a gun. Videos show an agent repeatedly punching a restrained man on the ground, which the Department of Homeland Security stated were defensive strikes after the man allegedly grabbed the agent's genitals. City leaders, including Mayor Daniel Biss, strongly condemned the agents' actions, with the mayor demanding ICE leave Evanston and the city passing ordinances declaring city property as "No ICE Zones." The Department of Homeland Security disputed claims that their agents caused the crash, stating they were being tailgated and that a hostile crowd then surrounded them. The Evanston Police Department is now documenting immigration enforcement scenes for the Illinois attorney general's office. Community members have organized rapid response teams to warn residents about federal agents and to slow their movement through the region. Witnesses described the scene as terrifying, with agents pointing guns and using pepper spray on community members.
