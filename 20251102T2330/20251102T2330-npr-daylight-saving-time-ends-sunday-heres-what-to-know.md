## Article summary
Daylight saving time ends this Sunday, requiring many Americans to reset their clocks back one hour. This change results in lighter mornings and darker evenings across most states, with the exception of Hawaii and Arizona. While some welcome the extra hour of sleep, others find the time change inconvenient. Nineteen states have passed legislation to make daylight saving time permanent, but federal law currently prevents this. An AP-NORC poll indicates that only 12% of U.S. adults favor the current system, with a majority preferring permanent daylight saving time. President Trump has publicly supported making daylight saving time permanent, urging Congress to act. However, efforts to pass legislation like the Sunshine Protection Act have stalled. Senator Tom Cotton has objected to permanent daylight saving time, citing concerns about dark winter mornings and their impact on safety and well-being.
