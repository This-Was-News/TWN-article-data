## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown is nearing its sixth week, with no end in sight as President Trump urges Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster to reopen the government. Democrats are demanding negotiations on extending government healthcare subsidies, while Republicans insist on reopening the government first. The stalemate is impacting millions of Americans, with potential delays in food aid and increasing flight disruptions due to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers. Trump's push to change Senate rules is met with resistance from some Republicans who value the filibuster's role in blocking Democratic policies. Democrats argue that Trump and Republicans are prioritizing political gamesmanship over the livelihoods of federal workers and citizens relying on programs like SNAP. The shutdown is on track to become the longest in U.S. history, surpassing the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019. Moderate Democrats are reportedly in talks with Republicans about potential compromises, but a meaningful resolution remains uncertain. The situation is further complicated by the opening of the Affordable Care Act enrollment period and rising premium costs. Both parties are awaiting a sign-off from President Trump, who has shown little interest in direct negotiations and has instead focused on mocking Democrats.
