## Article summary
The U.S. Senate is poised for dueling partisan votes on health care, with both Republican and Democratic proposals expected to fail due to a lack of bipartisan support. Republicans have united around a plan to let COVID-era health care subsidies expire and replace them with new savings accounts. Democrats, led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, criticize the Republican plan as "phony" and "dead on arrival," while Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, deem the Democratic bill insufficient in reforms. This gridlock could lead to increased premium payments for millions of Americans when current tax credits expire in January. The Republican proposal, championed by Senators Bill Cassidy and Mike Crapo, would allocate funds to health savings accounts for enrollees under certain income levels who choose high-deductible plans. Proponents argue this approach empowers individuals and reduces fraud, citing a GAO report. However, health analysts express concern that the plan may not adequately assist lower-income enrollees and could burden heavy users of health insurance with high out-of-pocket costs. Democrats, such as Senator Ron Wyden, argue the GOP proposal saddles middle-class Americans with high premiums and benefits insurance companies. The House of Representatives also faces internal divisions among Republicans regarding health care reform strategies. The failure to reach a compromise brings the contentious issue into the midterm election year with political talking points but little legislative progress.
