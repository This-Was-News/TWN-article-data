## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is considering whether to release full video footage of a boat strike that resulted in the deaths of two survivors, facing increasing pressure from Congress for disclosure. Hegseth briefed congressional leaders, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who expressed dissatisfaction with the information provided and insisted on the right for all members to view the video. Lawmakers are demanding a complete account of the military campaign and the specific attack, with legal experts suggesting it may have violated laws on the use of deadly force. The situation has prompted Congress to assert its oversight role after months of limited information from the Pentagon. Admiral Alvin Holsey, who is retiring early from his command of the campaign against drug boats near Venezuela, also briefed key lawmakers. Congress, through its annual defense authorization bill, is demanding unedited video and orders for the attacks, threatening to withhold travel funds from Hegseth if he refuses. Lawmakers are questioning the intelligence used to justify the strikes and the parameters of President Trump's campaign, which has targeted numerous boats and resulted in many deaths. Some senators are also pushing for legislation to halt Trump's ability to use military force against Venezuela without congressional approval. Concerns are growing over the legality and ethical implications of the strikes, particularly the follow-on strikes on wounded individuals.
