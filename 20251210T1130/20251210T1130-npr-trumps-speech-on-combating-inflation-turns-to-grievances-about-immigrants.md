## Article summary
President Donald Trump's speech in Pennsylvania, intended to address inflation, quickly devolved into grievances about immigrants. Trump claimed inflation was no longer a problem and accused Democrats of using "affordability" as a hoax. He reiterated his past remarks questioning why the U.S. accepts immigrants from "s-hole countries" and expressed a preference for those from Scandinavia. The event, held in a competitive House district, resembled a campaign rally rather than an official White House event. Despite Trump's claims of economic strength and efforts to display charts comparing price increases, voters in the area expressed concerns about persistent inflation impacting their daily lives. Some voters, even Trump supporters, are skeptical about his ability to lower prices, with one noting a significant increase in grocery bills. The speech occurred amidst Republican electoral vulnerabilities, as evidenced by recent off-cycle election results. Trump's administration aims to convince voters that the economy will improve, attributing current anxieties to past policies. The president also suggested that Americans should reduce their consumption of foreign-made goods like dolls to support domestic industries. Trump plans to hold more rallies to engage supporters ahead of the midterm elections, intending to place himself at the forefront of the campaign.
