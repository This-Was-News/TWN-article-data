## Article summary
María Corina Machado, this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, will not attend the award ceremony in Oslo due to threats from the Venezuelan government. Kristian Berg Harpviken, the head of the Nobel Institute, confirmed Machado's absence, stating she is not in the Norwegian capital and will not be on stage. Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, will accept the award on her behalf. Machado, the de facto opposition leader in Venezuela, has been in hiding since last year's election after President Nicolás Maduro's government threatened her with arrest. Traveling to Oslo would have posed significant risks, as she lives with a death threat from the regime. Machado has been a prominent voice for Venezuela's democratic opposition for over two decades, founding the voter rights group Súmate and later resisting Maduro's authoritarian rule. Despite public support, she was blocked from running for president in 2024 after winning an opposition primary, and was stripped of her seat in the National Assembly in 2014. The Norwegian Nobel Institute awarded her the prize in October for her contributions to advancing democracy in Venezuela. Her daughter has previously accepted other awards on her behalf, including the Sakharov Prize and the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize.
