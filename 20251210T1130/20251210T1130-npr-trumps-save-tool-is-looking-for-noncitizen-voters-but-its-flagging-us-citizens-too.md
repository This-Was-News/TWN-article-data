## Article summary
Texas is using the Trump administration's SAVE system to identify potential noncitizen voters, but the tool is flagging U.S. citizens, like Anthony Nel, a naturalized citizen who has been voting for years. Nel received a notice questioning his citizenship and was removed from voter rolls for not responding within 30 days, despite being a U.S. citizen for over a decade. This highlights concerns about SAVE's accuracy, as election experts worry it could disenfranchise eligible voters. The SAVE system has been controversial due to its rollout without public notice or transparency about its accuracy. While the Trump administration claims SAVE is reliable for verifying citizenship, critics fear it could be used to spread false narratives about noncitizen voting. Other states using SAVE have identified very small numbers of potential noncitizens. Election officials and voting rights advocates are concerned about data security and the potential for voter suppression. The process of flagging voters and the reliance on a single mailed notice are also points of concern, as many eligible voters may not receive or respond to such notices. The accuracy issues with SAVE are well-documented, and its expansion raises further privacy and legal questions.
