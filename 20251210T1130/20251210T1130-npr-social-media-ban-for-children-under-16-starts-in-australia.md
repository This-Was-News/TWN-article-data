## Article summary
Australia has implemented a groundbreaking social media ban for individuals under 16, a move Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has hailed as a victory for families reclaiming control from tech giants, despite acknowledging implementation challenges. The law, which took effect Wednesday, requires social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X to implement reasonable measures to remove accounts of Australian children younger than 16 or face substantial fines. Parents have reported initial difficulties, with some children attempting to circumvent the restrictions. The eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, stated that platforms possess the necessary technology and data to enforce the ban and will be issued notices to report on their compliance strategies. Communications Minister Anika Wells indicated that while not all platforms may agree with the law, they have committed to compliance, with over 200,000 TikTok accounts already deactivated. Wells cautioned that children attempting to evade detection will eventually be identified as platforms routinely review accounts. Advocates, including parents who have lost children to online harms, view the law as a crucial step towards protecting youth, though some, like the mother of teen influencers, foresee financial implications for those in the entertainment industry who rely on social media for their careers. The hope is that this legislation will encourage healthier, safer childhoods and inspire other nations to follow suit.
