## Article summary
Donald Trump admitted on Tuesday to using the slur "shithole countries" to disparage Haiti and African nations during a 2018 meeting with lawmakers. He previously denied making the remark, but boasted about it at a rally in Pennsylvania, further disparaging Somalia as "filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime." Trump recalled the incident when someone in the crowd yelled out the 2018 remark, and his retelling closely matched descriptions from those present at the time. He questioned why the U.S. only accepts people from "shithole countries" instead of from places like Norway or Sweden. The White House did not deny the remarks in 2018, but Trump tweeted that he did not use that language and never said anything derogatory about Haitians. At the time, his comments, which denigrated predominantly Black nations while favoring migration from white countries, were widely condemned as racist by some Republicans and foreign leaders. Trump has since continued to push past norms of decorum, frequently using curse words in public remarks and even dropping the F-bomb on camera twice this year. He has also used dated slurs when criticizing others, remaining unrepentant when questioned about such offensive language.
