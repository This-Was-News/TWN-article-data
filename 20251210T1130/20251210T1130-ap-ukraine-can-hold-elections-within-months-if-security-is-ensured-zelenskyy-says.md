## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine could hold elections within three months if security is guaranteed and electoral laws are amended. This response comes after U.S. President Donald Trump questioned Ukraine's democracy and suggested Zelenskyy was using the war as an excuse to avoid elections. Zelenskyy explained that holding elections during wartime presents significant challenges, including ensuring safety amidst missile attacks and determining voting procedures for military personnel. He also noted that Ukrainian law currently prohibits elections while martial law is in effect. Zelenskyy has asked lawmakers to draft proposals allowing elections under martial law, a move supported by most Ukrainians. Trump, echoing Russia's stance, believes it's an important time for Ukraine to hold an election. Meanwhile, a new U.S. national security strategy indicates Trump's desire to improve relations with Moscow. Russia's Foreign Minister praised Trump's commitment to dialogue and understanding of the war's causes. Zelenskyy is navigating conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv, seeking support from European allies after Trump's peace proposal leaned heavily towards Russia's demands. Military aid to Ukraine has declined, with a significant drop in allocations this year compared to previous years, though some European nations have increased their contributions.
