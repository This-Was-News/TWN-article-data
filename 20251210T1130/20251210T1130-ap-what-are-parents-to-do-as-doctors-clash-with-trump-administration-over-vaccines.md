## Article summary
Leading medical groups are in an unprecedented standoff with federal health officials over long-used vaccines. An advisory panel, handpicked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has questioned routine newborn vaccinations, including the hepatitis B vaccine, which medical organizations defend as life-saving and safe. This panel is also examining the entire childhood vaccination schedule, including ingredients and dosage. In response, groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics are issuing their own recommendations, largely mirroring pre-2025 federal guidance. Doctors emphasize the importance of consistent, evidence-based messages for patients, not politically driven ones, acknowledging the confusion this conflict creates for parents. The conflict extends to the assertion that vaccines do not cause autism, with recent changes to CDC webpages contradicting established scientific consensus. Federal agencies are also planning policy changes that could restrict future COVID-19 and flu shots. The departure from data-driven decision-making by the advisory panel is seen as eroding its credibility, with many parents expected to continue following their pediatricians' advice. Medical professionals urge parents to discuss vaccine concerns openly with their doctors, who aim to provide clear guidance amidst the evolving landscape.
