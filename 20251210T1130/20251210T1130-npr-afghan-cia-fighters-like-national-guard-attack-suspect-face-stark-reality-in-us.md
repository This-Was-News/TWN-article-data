## Article summary
Afghan fighters who served in CIA-led "Zero Units" in Afghanistan, facing intense combat, are now experiencing despair and neglect after being evacuated to the U.S. Many struggle with immigration status, leading to mental health crises and even suicides, as highlighted by the case of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the suspect in a recent shooting of National Guard members. Davud, a former Zero Unit fighter, describes a deep sense of betrayal, feeling abandoned by the U.S. government despite their loyal service. Geeta Bakshi, a former CIA agent, confirms these struggles and notes her organization has seen rising rates of self-harm among these veterans due to prolonged immigration delays. Lakanwal himself faced significant immigration hurdles and personal crisis before the shooting, with a volunteer noting his withdrawal and suicidal ideation. While some officials claim Lakanwal was not properly vetted, Davud and administration officials assert that these soldiers underwent rigorous vetting processes. The shooting has led to a freeze on Afghan asylum cases and a reexamination of refugee statuses. Despite these challenges, with proper support, many Afghan soldiers are adapting to life in America, though the community mourns those lost to suicide.
