## Article summary
Lawrence H. Summers, former president of Harvard and Treasury secretary, is stepping back from public commitments due to newly released emails showing his continued communication with Jeffrey Epstein. The emails reveal a closer relationship than previously known, with Summers seeking romantic advice and engaging in banter with Epstein for years after Epstein's 2008 sex trafficking charges. Summers expressed deep shame and took full responsibility for his decision to continue communicating with Epstein, though he will continue teaching at Harvard. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized Summers' judgment and called for institutions to sever ties with him, stating he cannot be trusted to advise policymakers or teach students. The Revolving Door Project also urged institutions like Harvard, OpenAI, and The New York Times to cut their associations with Summers. President Trump announced an investigation into Epstein's connections with Democrats, including Summers and Bill Clinton. The newly released emails, part of over 20,000 pages from House Republicans, also touch upon Summers' past controversial remarks about women and biological differences, a topic he had also discussed with Epstein.
