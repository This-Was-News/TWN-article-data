## Article summary
Despite the end of the government shutdown, many Head Start early learning programs across the U.S. are still not fully operational. Approximately 140 Head Start programs, serving hundreds of thousands of children in over 40 states, are still without federal resources. It is anticipated that most programs will receive their grant awards and regain access to federal resources within the next one to two weeks, before Thanksgiving. One program serving agricultural farm workers on the East Coast has already reopened by leveraging alternative resources, though they remain anxious about the delay. The dedication of Head Start programs to serving children and families was evident throughout the shutdown, despite the lack of visible impact. The timing of the shutdown at the start of the federal fiscal year meant no resources were immediately available, but the delay has allowed the Department of Health and Human Services to plan for future contingencies. Beyond political crises like shutdowns, Head Start faces significant challenges, including the low pay for early childhood educators, which is exacerbated by rising living costs. The focus should be on addressing these systemic workforce issues rather than navigating political shutdowns.
