## Article summary
The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, a measure that has caused significant division within the Republican party. Initially opposed by President Trump and Republican leadership, the bill gained momentum after Trump shifted his stance, urging Republicans to approve it. This bipartisan effort, led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, utilized a discharge petition to bypass leadership, securing the necessary 218 signatures for a floor vote. The vote follows the recent release of some Epstein-related documents by the House Oversight Committee, which have raised questions about Trump's past association with Epstein. Survivors of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell have strongly advocated for transparency, arguing that the release of these files is crucial for accountability and to expose a perceived double standard in the justice system. If passed, the bill would mandate the Justice Department to release all its Epstein files within 30 days. Trump has stated he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk, although he can already approve the release of these files without congressional action. The process has been contentious, with accusations of stalling tactics by House leadership, though Speaker Mike Johnson has denied these claims and committed to allowing the vote. The expected vote underscores the ongoing public interest and political maneuvering surrounding the Epstein case and the individuals connected to it.
