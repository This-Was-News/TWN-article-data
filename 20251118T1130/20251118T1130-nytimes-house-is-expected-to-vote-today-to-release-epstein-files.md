## Article summary
The House of Representatives is expected to vote overwhelmingly on Tuesday to compel the Justice Department to release all files pertaining to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. House Republicans had previously worked for months to avoid this vote, partly due to pressure from President Trump, who viewed any advancement of the vote as a hostile act. Despite this, Republican leaders are now embracing the Epstein transparency bill, with Representative Steve Scalise stating it's an important vote to demonstrate transparency. Previously, Republican leaders had argued the measure was unnecessary and did not adequately protect victims' identities. However, with a unanimous House vote now likely, they appear to be shifting their stance to align with the popular demand for disclosure, attempting to downplay their prior efforts to block the vote.
