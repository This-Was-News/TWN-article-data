## Article summary
President Trump has reversed his stance on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a rare retreat under pressure from his own party. Initially resisting the release, Trump directed House Republicans to support a bipartisan bill mandating his Justice Department to make the files public. This move comes as Republicans face a potential vote on the bill, which is expected to pass with unanimous support. The reversal raises questions about Trump's influence over the Republican party, especially amidst falling poll numbers and internal divisions. For much of his presidency, Trump has exerted significant control over Congress, but this episode marks a notable instance where he lost that control. House Republicans had been hesitant about a vote, caught between a base demanding transparency and the president's opposition. Despite the legislative action, it's unclear if it will lead to the actual release of the files, as Trump could have ordered it himself without congressional intervention. This situation highlights a potential shift in Trump's political leverage as the midterm elections approach and some Republicans consider post-Trump political futures.
