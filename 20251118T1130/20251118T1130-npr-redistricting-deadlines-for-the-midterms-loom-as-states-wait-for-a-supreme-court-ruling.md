## Article summary
States are closely watching a potential Supreme Court ruling that could weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against racial discrimination in redistricting. Such a decision might lead to a new wave of congressional map redrawing, particularly in Southern states, potentially benefiting Republicans seeking to maintain control of the House of Representatives. The timing of the Supreme Court's ruling is critical, as states have looming deadlines for candidate filings for the 2026 midterm elections. Some states, like Louisiana and Alabama, have already adjusted their election calendars to accommodate potential redistricting changes. It is difficult to identify all districts that could be affected, as states do not always specify their reasoning for district boundaries. Some experts suggest that states might use the ruling as an excuse to eliminate minority-majority districts, even without a legal obligation. Conversely, some Republican-led states might choose to maintain existing Section 2 districts to consolidate their power. The reaction of Democratic-led states to potential Republican gerrymandering is also a significant factor, with the possibility of retaliatory redistricting efforts in blue states.
