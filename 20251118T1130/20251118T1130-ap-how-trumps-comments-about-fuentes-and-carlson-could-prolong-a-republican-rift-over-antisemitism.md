## Article summary
President Donald Trump is facing criticism for his response to antisemitism within the Republican Party, particularly his comments regarding white nationalist Nick Fuentes and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. Trump praised Carlson and declined to criticize Fuentes, despite Fuentes' history of bigoted beliefs and remarks about "organized Jewry." This stance has drawn disappointment from groups like the Zionist Organization of America and has the potential to prolong a rift within the Republican Party. The controversy has already impacted organizations like the Heritage Foundation, leading to resignations and internal debate. While some, like Matthew Brooks of the Republican Jewish Coalition, defend Trump's overall record on supporting Israel, others feel he has fallen short in condemning antisemitism. The issue is expected to remain a significant political topic, with upcoming events planned by conservative leaders to address extremism and antisemitism. Trump's past reluctance to disavow controversial figures, such as David Duke and the Proud Boys, is highlighted as a pattern of behavior. The Republican Jewish Coalition's recent summit, initially planned around a Gaza ceasefire, shifted focus to condemning antisemitism within the party, with some attendees signaling their disapproval of Carlson. Trump's prerecorded address to the summit focused on his administration's support for Israel, omitting any mention of the antisemitism controversy.
