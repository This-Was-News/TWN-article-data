## Article summary
Former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard professor Larry Summers has announced he will step back from public commitments following the release of emails detailing a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Summers stated his decision is to "rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me." He expressed deep shame for his actions and took full responsibility for his "misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein." Summers will continue to teach economics at Harvard. The released emails showed that many in Epstein's network maintained contact even after his 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Summers had previously called his association with Epstein a "major error in judgment."
