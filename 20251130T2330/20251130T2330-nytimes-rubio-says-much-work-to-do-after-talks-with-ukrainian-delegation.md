## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that "much work to do" after talks with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida aimed at a peace settlement to end the war with Russia. The delegation was led by Rustem Umerov, who replaced Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky, following a corruption investigation. President Trump indicated he has decided on a replacement for Fed chair Jerome H. Powell but offered no details. Meanwhile, Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for President Trump, is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow to discuss the invasion of Ukraine. In a separate development, top Republicans and Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about potential war crimes related to U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean. Reports suggest a follow-up strike was ordered to kill survivors of an initial attack, prompting calls for increased scrutiny and investigations into the legality of these operations. President Trump also declared Venezuelan airspace closed, escalating his administration's actions against drug cartels, though his authority over the airspace is questionable. Despite these actions, the effectiveness of Venezuela's role in the U.S. drug trade is debated, with experts suggesting it plays a minor part. The Trump administration's approach to Venezuela has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue it could lead to a costly foreign war without congressional authorization.
