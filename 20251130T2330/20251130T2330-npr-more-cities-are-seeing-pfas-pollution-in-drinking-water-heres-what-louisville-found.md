## Article summary
The Louisville Water Company regularly monitors for PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," due to their persistence and potential health risks. In December 2024, an unexpected spike in GenX, a type of PFAS, was detected in the raw Ohio River water, reaching 52 parts per trillion. This surge was traced upstream to a Chemours factory in West Virginia that uses GenX to produce fluoropolymers. The Chemours facility has a history of PFAS pollution, with a prior owner, DuPont, facing lawsuits for environmental contamination. Although the spike in GenX levels in Louisville's raw water was significant, the treated drinking water remained within federal safety limits. However, the incident highlights challenges for water utilities, especially as the EPA's regulations on PFAS in drinking water are evolving and potentially being scaled back. Chemours denies its discharges are connected to the Louisville spike, stating their finished water is safe. The company is currently involved in litigation over exceeding permit limits for PFAS discharge into the Ohio River. Water utilities face significant costs to remove PFAS, with prevention at the source being a more cost-effective approach. A federal judge ordered Chemours to stop over-polluting, a decision hailed as a victory for public health and the Ohio River.
