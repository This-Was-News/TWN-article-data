## Article summary
Federal authorities are investigating a shooting incident involving National Guard members in Washington, D.C., which has coincided with significant shifts in U.S. immigration policy. The Trump administration has halted all asylum decisions and plans to permanently pause migration from "Third World Countries." Every National Guard patrol in D.C. will now be accompanied by a D.C. police officer to enhance security. The shooting victims, West Virginia National Guard members Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, are being remembered for their service. Beckstrom, 20, died in the incident, while Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition. Both had volunteered for the mission in D.C. The suspect, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who previously worked with a CIA-operated counterterrorism unit, now faces a first-degree murder charge. His motive for the shooting remains under investigation. Lakanwal immigrated to the U.S. in 2021 following the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. The immigration policy changes announced by the administration aim to ensure all individuals are thoroughly vetted before entering the country.
