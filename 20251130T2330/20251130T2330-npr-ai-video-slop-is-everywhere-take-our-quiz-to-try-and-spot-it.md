## Article summary
The proliferation of AI-generated video content, often referred to as 'slop,' is making it increasingly difficult to discern reality from fabrication online. Experts like Mike Caulfield, Kolina Koltai, and Hany Farid advise caution and offer strategies to identify potentially fake videos. A key indicator of AI-generated content is its typical short length, often around 8-10 seconds, due to the high computational cost of creation. Additionally, AI videos may exhibit perfect framing and unnaturally smooth camera movements. The source of the video is crucial; checking where it was posted and the history of the account can provide significant clues. Reverse image searches can help locate the original source or corroborating news reports. Koltai warns against the 'liar's dividend,' where the existence of fake videos makes it easier to dismiss real ones as fabricated, thus eroding trust in crucial evidence like bystander videos. Videos that evoke strong emotional responses or contradict beliefs should be scrutinized, as they are often designed to drive engagement. Sharing content without verification contributes to the problem, as creators are often motivated by monetary incentives. In an age where speed is prioritized over accuracy, waiting for confirmation from multiple sources or news reports is a prudent approach. Ultimately, the inability to distinguish between real and AI-generated content poses a significant danger to our ability to trust information online.
