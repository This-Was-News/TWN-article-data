## Article summary
A significant winter storm impacted the Great Lakes region over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, causing widespread flight cancellations and delays in Chicago. O'Hare International Airport experienced record snowfall for November, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations and over a thousand delays. The Federal Aviation Administration reported significant delays for departures to and from O'Hare due to snow and ice. Other airports, including Detroit Metro Airport, also faced substantial disruptions. In Wisconsin, thousands of residents experienced power outages, and some areas received up to 12 inches of snow. Hazardous travel conditions persisted in Iowa due to gusty winds blowing snow back onto roads. While the snow in the Great Lakes region began to taper off, a new storm was predicted to bring significant snowfall to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Tuesday, though major cities were not expected to receive heavy accumulation.
