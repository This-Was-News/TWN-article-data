## Article summary
A major winter storm is causing significant travel disruptions across the central and northern Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes regions as millions of Americans return home after the Thanksgiving holiday. The storm, characterized by widespread heavy snowfall and hazardous conditions, has already dropped up to 8 inches of snow in some areas, with snowfall rates exceeding one inch per hour expected. This has led to numerous flight cancellations and delays, particularly at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and has prompted warnings from officials to delay travel in affected areas. The Missouri State Highway Patrol reported at least nine car crashes related to the storm. While the northern and central U.S. face snow and ice, parts of Texas and Louisiana could experience heavy rain and flooding. A new storm system is forecast to move to the East Coast by Tuesday, bringing heavy snow to the northern mid-Atlantic and New England, and heavy rain to the Southeast. Monday is expected to be the best day for holiday travel, with conditions worsening on Tuesday. These weather-related disruptions are compounded by mandatory software upgrades for Airbus A320 aircraft, which require airlines to update flight control software before planes can fly, potentially causing further delays.
