## Article summary
The Afghan man accused of fatally shooting two National Guard members near the White House had a history of severe "dark isolation" and erratic behavior, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an asylum seeker who arrived in the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, struggled to hold a job and alternated between long periods of seclusion and spontaneous cross-country trips. A community advocate expressed concerns to a refugee organization about Lakanwal's deteriorating mental state, fearing he might harm himself. Despite these warnings, the advocate was stunned when Lakanwal was named as the suspect in the attack that critically wounded Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, with Beckstrom later dying from her injuries. Lakanwal, who previously served in a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan, resettled in Washington state with his wife and five young sons. Emails described his inability to function as a provider, his job loss in March 2023, and periods where he would not respond to anyone, not even his family. His children sometimes had to coax him out of his room, and when his wife was away, the children were neglected. The community member noted that Lakanwal would sometimes try to re-engage with services but would then enter "manic episodes" of driving across the country. The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants reportedly visited Lakanwal's family in March 2024, but it is unclear if he accepted their assistance. Investigators are still working to determine a motive for the attack.
