## Article summary
Hondurans are heading to the polls to elect a new president amidst fears of potential volatility. The election has been influenced by President Trump's endorsement of a candidate and his announcement of a pardon for a former president convicted of drug trafficking. Two right-wing candidates, including the one backed by Trump, have raised concerns about Honduras becoming a socialist-led authoritarian state, drawing parallels to Venezuela. They have also accused the current left-wing party of plotting to retain power. These accusations echo the violence that erupted after the disputed 2017 election, where the former president, Juan Orlando Hernández, claimed victory, leading to protests and a military crackdown that resulted in nearly two dozen deaths. Residents in the capital, Tegucigalpa, are on edge, with businesses boarded up and people stocking up on groceries in anticipation of potential unrest and uncertainty.
