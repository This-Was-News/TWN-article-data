## Article summary
Top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, are meeting with Ukrainian negotiators in Florida to discuss a peace framework aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine. This meeting occurs as President Trump seeks to broker a deal and plans to send Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin. The talks come at a critical time for Ukraine, which is facing domestic pressures following the resignation of its lead negotiator, Andrii Yermak, amid an embezzlement scandal. Yermak's home was searched by anti-corruption investigators just before the Florida meeting. The Ukrainian delegation includes key military and security officials. Discussions are focused on revisions to a 28-point plan initially proposed by Trump, which had been criticized for favoring Russian demands, including territorial concessions and military limitations for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed optimism about the constructive approach from the American side and the potential to outline steps for a dignified end to the war. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine, with recent drone and missile strikes in and around Kyiv causing casualties. Ukraine has also claimed responsibility for damaging an oil terminal near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, prompting Kazakhstan to urge Ukraine to cease such attacks due to the impact on its oil exports.
