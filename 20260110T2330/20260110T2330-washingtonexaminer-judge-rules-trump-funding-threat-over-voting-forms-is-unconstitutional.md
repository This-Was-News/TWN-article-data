## Article summary
A federal judge has blocked President Trump's threat to withhold funding from states over changes to their voting systems and registration forms. U.S. District Judge John Chun ruled that the President's actions unconstitutionally pressure states and violate the separation of powers, as the President lacks the authority to unilaterally impose new conditions on federal funds. Chun stated that the President's role is to oversee laws, not to be a lawmaker. This ruling is the third time a federal judge has blocked Trump's executive order aimed at preserving election integrity. A White House spokesperson asserted that the administration is committed to election security and expects to win on appeal. The administration plans to appeal this decision, as well as previous rulings by other federal judges. Judge Chun explicitly stated that the Constitution does not grant the President authority over federal election administration. Trump has previously made claims about the 2020 election being rigged.
