## Article summary
Democrats are calling for the release of the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) 2024 election autopsy report, following the party's losses in the Senate and White House. DNC Chairman Ken Martin has declined to make the report public, citing concerns that it would be a distraction and cause divisions within the party. However, several Democrats, including Rep. Ro Khanna, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, and Sen. John Fetterman, have expressed support for transparency and believe the report should be released. Corbin Trent, former communications director for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, criticized the DNC's decision as cowardice, suggesting the report reveals the party needs fundamental change. While some lawmakers are unaware of the report's withholding or unconcerned, others, like Rep. Jamie Raskin, believe information eventually comes to light in Washington. Martin maintains that the DNC has already incorporated the report's lessons and is focused on future wins, arguing that dwelling on the past is a distraction. The DNC conducted hundreds of interviews for the report, but its public release remains uncertain.
