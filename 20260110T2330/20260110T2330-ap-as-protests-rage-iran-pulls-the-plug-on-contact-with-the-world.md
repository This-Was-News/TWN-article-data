## Article summary
Iran has shut down internet and telephone services for its 85 million citizens, severing their connection to the outside world. This action, reminiscent of tactics used during past protests and conflicts, aims to limit the sharing of information and images of ongoing nationwide demonstrations against the country's ailing economy. These protests represent the most significant challenge to the government in years. The internet blackout follows a warning from the Trump administration about consequences for further deaths among demonstrators. Loved ones abroad are expressing extreme anxiety due to the lack of news, with Iran's attorney general warning that protesters could face the death penalty. This is the third time Iran has imposed such an internet shutdown, with previous instances occurring in 2019 and 2022. While Starlink satellite internet has played a role in circumventing restrictions, it is now facing jamming efforts, including GPS signal disruption, potentially hindering its effectiveness. The situation is dire for those in Iran, as using Starlink is now illegal and carries severe risks. Activists fear that without external support or a change in the extreme violence from security forces, the protests may not be sustainable.
