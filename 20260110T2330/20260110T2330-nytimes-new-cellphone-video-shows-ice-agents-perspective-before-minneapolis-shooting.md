## Article summary
A new cellphone video has emerged, appearing to show the moments before an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. The 47-second footage, reportedly from the agent's phone, captures him approaching Ms. Good's SUV, which was partially blocking a residential street. Ms. Good is heard speaking, and her wife, Becca Good, confronts the agent, filming him and asserting her U.S. citizenship and veteran status. As additional agents arrive, Ms. Good's SUV begins to move in reverse, then forward, while the agent filming is in front of the vehicle. The video abruptly shifts to point skyward as gunshots are heard. The Department of Homeland Security maintains the shooting was lawful self-defense, while Minnesota Democrats dispute this, calling the government's narrative propaganda. Conservatives, however, view the video as proof that the agent feared for his life, a sentiment echoed by Vice President JD Vance and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. State Representative Aisha Gomez remains convinced the shooting was unjustified, criticizing the video's release as an attempt to justify the agent's actions.
