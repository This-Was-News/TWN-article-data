## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to shield Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts from legal claims by creditors. The order, citing national security and foreign policy interests, aims to protect U.S. efforts to achieve political stability in Venezuela. Trump stated that seizing these funds would significantly hinder these critical efforts. This action follows a recent U.S. operation in Venezuela's capital, which led to the apprehension of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife on federal charges. Trump indicated that the U.S. would assist in managing Venezuela until it becomes politically and economically stable. The executive order clarifies that the "Foreign Government Deposit Funds" are sovereign assets of Venezuela, not private property. The U.S. government will hold these funds in a custodial capacity, not as a market participant. The order emphasizes that protecting these funds is crucial for U.S. foreign policy objectives, including curbing illegal immigration, combating illicit narcotics, countering malign actors like Iran and Hezbollah, and promoting peace and stability in Venezuela and the Western Hemisphere.
