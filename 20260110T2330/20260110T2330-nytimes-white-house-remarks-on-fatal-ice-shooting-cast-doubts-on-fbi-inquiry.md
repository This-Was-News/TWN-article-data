## Article summary
The FBI's investigation into the killing of Renee Nicole Good by a federal agent is facing doubts following remarks from the White House. Minnesota officials were blocked from investigating the death, with the administration explaining that local investigators could not be trusted. President Trump had already declared the shooting justified, and Vice President Vance asserted federal agents have absolute immunity. The homeland security secretary also spoke of the incident as a closed case, claiming Good weaponized her SUV, despite video evidence suggesting otherwise. This public stance contrasts with previous presidents' approaches and raises concerns among former law enforcement officials about the FBI's willingness to scrutinize the agent's actions. Former officials question whether the FBI is conducting a genuine investigation or merely attempting to justify the shooting by discrediting the victim. The White House and Justice Department cited remarks by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, blaming the shooting on immigration operations, as a reason to cut off cooperation with state investigators. State and city officials plan to conduct their own investigations and have urged witnesses to come forward, though federal prosecutors have historically intervened in such cases. Some former agents believe the FBI's involvement in immigration operations creates a conflict of interest, making it difficult for the bureau to act as a neutral arbiter in use-of-force investigations.
