## Article summary
Shortly after a federal officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis, social media users mistakenly identified two unrelated individuals as the shooter, leading to online harassment and threats. Steve Grove, the publisher and chief executive of The Minnesota Star Tribune, was wrongly accused, causing him concern about a vigilante hunt. Simultaneously, a gun shop owner named Steven Grove in Springfield, Missouri, also received accusations and threats, despite having no connection to the event. The misinformation appears to have originated from an image generated by X's Grok chatbot, which users falsely identified as Steve Grove. This incident highlights the dangers of rapid information dissemination and the use of AI tools that can 'hallucinate' or fabricate details. Experts emphasize the trade-off between speed and accuracy in news consumption, noting that amateur sleuths on social media have a history of misidentifying individuals. The case serves as a stark reminder of the need for fact-checked information from reliable sources amidst the proliferation of online disinformation.
