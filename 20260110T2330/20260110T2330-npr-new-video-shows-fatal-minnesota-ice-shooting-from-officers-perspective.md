## Article summary
A new video has emerged showing the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis from the officer's perspective. The video, posted online by Alpha News and shared by the Department of Homeland Security, captures the final moments of the encounter, including exchanges between the officer and Good's wife. The shooting has sparked protests and criticism of federal immigration enforcement tactics. Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin have stated the video supports their claim that the officer acted in self-defense, a notion rejected by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. Policing experts have raised questions about the officer's training, particularly regarding filming with a handheld device while armed. The Hennepin County Attorney's office is seeking public submissions of evidence related to the shooting and asserts its jurisdiction in the case. The incident occurred during a large-scale immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities, described as the biggest ever by Homeland Security, with over 1,500 arrests reported. Separately, a shooting involving a Border Patrol officer in Portland, Oregon, also led to protests. The federal government has defended the actions of its officers in both incidents.
