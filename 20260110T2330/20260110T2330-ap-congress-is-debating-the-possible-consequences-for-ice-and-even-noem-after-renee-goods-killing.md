## Article summary
The killing of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis has ignited a debate in Congress regarding the consequences for ICE and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Democrats are demanding a thorough investigation, policy changes, and even the defunding of ICE, while some are calling for Noem's impeachment. The incident has become a focal point amidst President Trump's aggressive deportation operations, which have led to nationwide protests. Republicans, while expressing some concern, largely defend the administration's policies and the officer's actions, with some blaming Good for the incident. The shooting occurred as the federal government faces a potential shutdown, with appropriations for agencies like the Department of Homeland Security up for debate. Previous ICE and Customs and Border Protection shootings have also drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. The incident has highlighted the deep divisions in Congress over immigration policy, with Democrats aiming to use the situation to pressure the administration for changes in ICE's tactics. The Republican administration stated the ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democrats dispute this, urging the public to view available videos of the shooting. This event, one of several recent deaths linked to deportation efforts, could significantly alter the political landscape surrounding immigration enforcement.
