## Article summary
Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has indicated that the United States may soon take military action in Iran to support ongoing protests. These demonstrations, which have spread to over 100 cities, began due to economic struggles but have evolved into calls for the regime's overthrow. Reports suggest Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei might be planning to flee the country. The Iranian regime has responded with a crackdown, resulting in at least 65 deaths and 2,300 arrests. Graham conveyed a message to the protesters, stating their "long nightmare is soon coming to a close" and that "Help is on the way." This follows President Donald Trump's repeated suggestions of U.S. intervention if the regime harms protesters. Trump has stated the U.S. is ready to help, and Iran is "looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before." However, Iran's military leadership has rebuked these warnings, threatening preemptive strikes and urging Trump to stay out of the situation.
