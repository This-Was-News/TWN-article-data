## Article summary
The Washington National Opera is departing the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, ending a residency that began in 1971. This decision stems from new policies implemented by the Kennedy Center, which the opera company states are financially incompatible with its operational model. The center's requirement for full advance funding conflicts with the opera's reliance on a mix of ticket sales, grants, and donations that are not always secured prior to production planning. Furthermore, the opera company argues that the new model does not accommodate its artistic mission of balancing popular works with more experimental pieces. This departure follows a series of other artists and performance groups who have canceled their engagements at the Kennedy Center since Donald Trump became chairman of its board. These cancellations are largely a response to the board's decision to rename the center, which has been met with significant backlash. Artists like Hamilton, Issa Rae, and Rhiannon Giddens have cited political reasons and a perceived shift away from the center's founding principles as motivations for their withdrawals. The Kennedy Center, through its executive director Richard Grenell, has defended its decisions, framing some cancellations as politically motivated and stating a desire for greater flexibility in programming. The situation highlights a growing tension between artistic expression, institutional policy, and political influence within a major national cultural venue.
