## Article summary
A Ukrainian drone strike ignited a fire at an oil depot in Russia's Volgograd region on Saturday, according to officials. This action followed a significant Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine, which disrupted power and heating for millions. Ukraine's General Staff claimed responsibility for the strike on the Zhutovskaya oil depot, stating it supplies fuel to Russian forces and that damage was being assessed. The drone strikes on Russian energy sites are part of Ukraine's strategy to cut off oil export revenue vital for Russia's invasion. The previous day, Russia launched a major barrage, including its new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Ukrainian officials reported at least four deaths in the capital from this attack. The UN expressed concern over the civilian casualties and the deprivation of essential services during winter. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko indicated that power restoration in Kyiv was underway, though more complex on the left bank due to grid damage. Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed strikes on Ukrainian energy and fuel storage facilities, claiming to have neutralized numerous Ukrainian drones over Russia and Crimea. Ukraine's military also reported striking a drone storage facility and a command and control point in southern and eastern Ukraine.
