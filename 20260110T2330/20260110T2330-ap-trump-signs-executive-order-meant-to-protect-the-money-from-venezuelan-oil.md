## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at protecting Venezuelan oil revenue from being used in judicial proceedings. The order, made public on Saturday, asserts that seizing these funds could jeopardize U.S. efforts to foster economic and political stability in Venezuela. This action follows concerns raised by oil company executives, such as ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, who described Venezuela as "uninvestable" due to its instability. During a meeting with these executives, Trump sought to reassure them, stating they would engage directly with the U.S. instead of the Venezuelan government. Venezuela has a history marked by state asset seizures, U.S. sanctions, and political uncertainty. The Trump administration prioritizes rebuilding Venezuela's infrastructure by encouraging U.S. oil company investment, especially after the removal of Nicolás Maduro. The White House frames this initiative in economic terms, with Trump asserting control over the sales of previously sanctioned Venezuelan crude. Trump stated on his social media that he is "already making Venezuela rich and safe again." The executive order designates the oil revenue as property of Venezuela held by the U.S. for diplomatic purposes, exempt from private claims. Its legal basis lies in the National Emergencies Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, with Trump citing the potential for these revenues to be entangled in legal proceedings as a threat to the U.S.
