## Article summary
The Pentagon has ordered the deployment of the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford and its accompanying warships to waters off Latin America, a significant escalation of U.S. military presence in the region. This move is part of an intensified campaign against illicit actors and drug trafficking, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stating it will bolster U.S. capacity to monitor and disrupt activities compromising national security. The Ford, the Navy's most advanced carrier, carries approximately 5,000 sailors and over 75 aircraft. This deployment is unusual as it cuts short the carrier's European tour for a potential combat mission amid escalating U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats. The Trump administration asserts these strikes are lawful, viewing cartel drug trafficking as an armed attack on the U.S., allowing boat crews to be targeted as combatants. However, legal specialists argue these actions violate domestic and international law by deliberately targeting civilians. The administration has not provided a clear legal theory for these actions, relying instead on a policy argument that they are necessary due to high overdose deaths in the U.S. The campaign has resulted in numerous deaths, with some victims identified as Colombian citizens, leading to diplomatic tensions. The administration is also reportedly considering land strikes in Venezuela against drug facilities, with proponents including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The deployment of the Ford is seen as another step in this escalating pressure campaign.
