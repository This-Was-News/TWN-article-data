## Article summary
The U.S. government intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia as early as October 31st, according to a recent court filing. Abrego Garcia's case has become a focal point for opposition to President Trump's immigration policies, particularly after his mistaken deportation to El Salvador in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. by the Supreme Court, but cannot be deported back to El Salvador due to a fear of gang violence. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has since attempted to deport him to several African nations. A federal judge had previously blocked his immediate deportation, and Abrego Garcia's lawsuit claims the administration is using the deportation process punitively. The Department of Homeland Security argues Liberia is a suitable destination due to its democracy, human rights protections, and status as a U.S. partner. However, Abrego Garcia's attorney states Liberia has no connection to his client and highlights Costa Rica's willingness to accept him as a refugee. Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, immigrated illegally as a teenager and has applied for asylum in the U.S. He is also facing federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, which he denies and claims are vindictive.
