## Article summary
The U.S. military is escalating its presence in Latin America by sending the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford to waters off South America. This move is part of a broader military buildup in the region aimed at detecting and disrupting illicit activities. The Pentagon announced this deployment following the military's tenth strike on a suspected drug-running boat in the Caribbean, which resulted in six deaths and has been attributed to the Tren de Aragua gang. The pace of these strikes has increased significantly since September, with at least 43 individuals killed. In other news, President Trump has called off a surge of federal forces to San Francisco after conversations with local officials. The State Department announced a reduction in U.S. assistance to Colombia, citing accusations of involvement in the global drug trade against President Gustavo Petro's government.

Meanwhile, concerns are rising in Congress regarding the lack of transparency surrounding the escalating strikes on drug-running vessels. Brazilian President Lula da Silva expressed that countries should not violate sovereignty in the name of fighting drug trafficking, and intends to discuss this with President Trump. Legal challenges continue regarding the deployment of National Guard troops in various cities, with judges considering the legality of such actions.
