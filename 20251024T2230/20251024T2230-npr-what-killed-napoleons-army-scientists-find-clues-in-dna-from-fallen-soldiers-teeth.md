## Article summary
A mass grave of approximately two to three thousand of Napoleon's soldiers, discovered in Lithuania in 2001, has provided new insights into the causes of death for his retreating army. Scientists analyzed DNA from the teeth of 13 soldiers, treating them as "time machines" to reveal past infections. The study, published in Current Biology, identified DNA from two unexpected pathogens: one causing paratyphoid fever and another causing relapsing fever, a disease transmitted by body lice. These findings add to previously known afflictions like typhus and trench fever, which were also common among Napoleon's soldiers due to poor conditions and the presence of body lice. The harsh conditions of the 1812 retreat from Russia, marked by extreme cold, hunger, and disease, led to the demise of hundreds of thousands of soldiers. This research highlights the complex microbial assault faced by Napoleon's men, revealing a grim reality behind the romanticized image of war. The study of ancient pathogens also offers valuable lessons for understanding and combating modern diseases, by revealing how pathogens emerge, spread, and evolve. The bones and teeth of these soldiers tell a story of hardship, malnutrition, and widespread illness, painting a starkly different picture than historical depictions of military glory.
