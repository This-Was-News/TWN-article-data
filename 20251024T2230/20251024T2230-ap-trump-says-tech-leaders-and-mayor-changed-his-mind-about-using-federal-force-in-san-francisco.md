## Article summary
President Donald Trump initially planned to deploy federal forces to San Francisco, a city he has frequently criticized. However, he decided to postpone this action after receiving calls from prominent tech leaders, including Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce, as well as from Mayor Daniel Lurie. These individuals reportedly informed Trump that San Francisco was actively working to reduce crime. Trump stated he would allow the city leaders to address the issue and would reconsider federal intervention if their efforts proved unsuccessful. The planned deployment, which was set for Saturday, included potential National Guard troops and increased immigration enforcement. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that operations were called off for the entire Bay Area. Mayor Lurie emphasized that San Francisco is on the rise, with increasing visitor numbers and business activity, while acknowledging the city's ongoing partnership with federal authorities to combat illegal narcotics. He expressed concern that military presence would hinder the city's recovery. While some praised Lurie's leadership in influencing Trump's decision, others, like San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, expressed skepticism about Trump's commitment. Trump mentioned receiving calls from several business leaders who urged him not to send federal forces. Marc Benioff had previously suggested welcoming Guard troops but later apologized, stating they were not needed.
