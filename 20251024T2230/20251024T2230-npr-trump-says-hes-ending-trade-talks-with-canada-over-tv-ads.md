## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced he is ending all trade negotiations with Canada due to a television advertisement that he claims misrepresented facts and interfered with U.S. court decisions. The ad, created by the government of Ontario, featured edited remarks from Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. Trump called this "egregious behavior" and stated that tariffs are crucial for U.S. national security and the economy. This abrupt termination of talks escalates existing trade tensions between the two neighboring countries, which have been building for months. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had previously stated his intention to increase exports to countries outside the U.S. in response to Trump's tariffs. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute confirmed that the ad misrepresented Reagan's 1987 speech and that they did not grant permission for its use, stating they are reviewing legal options. Trump had previously noted the ad, suggesting it showed the impact of his tariffs. The premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, had launched the advertising campaign to oppose American tariffs. Trump's tariffs have significantly impacted Canada's auto sector, leading to decisions like Stellantis moving a production line from Ontario to Illinois. Over three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., with billions of dollars in goods and services crossing the border daily.
