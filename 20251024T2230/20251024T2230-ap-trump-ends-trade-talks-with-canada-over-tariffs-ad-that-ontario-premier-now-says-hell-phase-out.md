## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced the termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, citing a television advertisement sponsored by the province of Ontario. The ad used words from former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs, which Trump alleged misrepresented Reagan's stance and attempted to influence the U.S. Supreme Court. This escalation followed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's statement about doubling exports outside the U.S. due to tariff threats. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province sponsored the ad, later announced it would be phased out to allow trade talks to resume, stating their goal of reaching U.S. audiences had been achieved. The ad's content, particularly its portrayal of Reagan's views on tariffs, was disputed by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, which stated it did not grant permission for its use and was reviewing legal options. Despite the ad's eventual removal, it was scheduled to continue airing over the weekend. White House officials characterized the ad as an example of Canadian officials playing games rather than engaging constructively. Trump's administration has expressed long-standing frustration with Canada's negotiation strategy and flexibility. The U.S. has imposed steep tariffs on Canadian goods, leading to retaliatory measures from Canada, significantly impacting sectors like the auto industry. This dispute occurs amidst ongoing reviews of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
