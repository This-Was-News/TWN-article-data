## Article summary
The Trump administration has significantly escalated its military presence in Latin America by deploying the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford and its accompanying warships and attack planes to the region. This move is intended to bolster the U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that threaten homeland security and prosperity in the Western Hemisphere. The Pentagon stated that the enhanced presence will aid in counterterrorism and counternarcotics missions. The Ford, the Navy's most advanced carrier, carries approximately 5,000 sailors and over 75 aircraft. This deployment follows recent U.S. military actions, including about 10,000 troops sent to the Caribbean since late August for similar missions. The administration has acknowledged 10 strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats, resulting in 43 fatalities. While aircraft carriers have previously visited these waters, cutting short the Ford's European deployment for a potential combat mission in Latin America is considered highly unusual by naval officials. This deployment represents a uniquely powerful naval combat group in the Caribbean, according to a former head of U.S. Southern Command.
