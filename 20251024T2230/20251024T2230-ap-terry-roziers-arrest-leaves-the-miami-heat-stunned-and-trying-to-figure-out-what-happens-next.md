## Article summary
Miami Heat player Terry Rozier has been placed on indefinite leave by the NBA following his arrest and charges related to an alleged gambling scheme. Prosecutors claim Rozier conspired with friends to help them win bets based on his performance in a March 2023 game while he was with the Charlotte Hornets. Heat captain Bam Adebayo expressed the team's full support for Rozier, emphasizing that he is considered a brother to his teammates. The team is now focused on moving forward, similar to how the Portland Trail Blazers are dealing with coach Chauncey Billups' arrest for alleged involvement in a poker cheating ring. Rozier's performance had already declined significantly in recent games before his arrest. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra acknowledged Rozier's positive impact on the team and sent him thoughts and care during this difficult time. Rozier's attorney has denied any wrongdoing. The incident raises questions about the player's future with the team as they navigate his absence. The Heat players discussed how to support their teammate after his arrest. The league's demands require the team to compartmentalize and focus on upcoming games despite the circumstances.
