## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers decided not to recommend COVID-19 vaccinations for anyone, leaving the choice up to individuals. This shift contrasts with previous recommendations that nearly all Americans receive the vaccine annually, similar to flu shots. The FDA had already restricted this year's shots to people over 65 or those at higher risk. The CDC's advisers voted against recommending the shots even for high-risk groups, suggesting individuals consult healthcare providers. The panel also urged stronger language around vaccine risks, despite pushback from medical groups citing the shots' proven safety. The panel narrowly avoided recommending prescription requirements for the vaccine, citing potential barriers to access. The decision reflects Kennedy's efforts to reshape vaccine policies based on his long-standing suspicions about their safety and effectiveness. Public health experts expressed concern that the lack of a recommendation may confuse people about the benefits of the vaccine. Several states and health insurers have taken steps to ensure continued access to the vaccines. The CDC's interim director, Jim O'Neill, must approve the panel's decision. COVID-19 remains a significant public health threat, with recent data showing thousands of deaths and hospitalizations, particularly among unvaccinated seniors and young children. The vaccines provide strong protection against severe infection and death, despite the virus's evolving nature.
