## Article summary
ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show following conservative backlash over a monologue where he criticized the MAGA movement's response to a murder. The suspension came amid Nexstar's proposed $6 billion merger with Tegna, which requires Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr pressured ABC affiliates to pre-empt Kimmel's show, threatening regulatory action. Nexstar, owning 32 ABC affiliates, announced it would stop airing Kimmel's program, likely to appease the FCC. Sinclair, another major affiliate owner, also suspended the show. ABC then announced an indefinite suspension of Kimmel's program, influenced by advertiser concerns and potential FCC scrutiny. The FCC chairman publicly thanked Nexstar for its decision. This incident highlights the influence of political pressure and regulatory considerations on media companies' decisions.
