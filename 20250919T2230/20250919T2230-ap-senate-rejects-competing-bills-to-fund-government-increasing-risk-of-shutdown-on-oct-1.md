## Article summary
The Senate rejected both Republican and Democratic bills to fund the government, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on October 1. Democrats accused Republicans of not negotiating on healthcare priorities, while Republicans claimed Democrats were making excessive spending demands. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urged negotiations, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune showed no indication of changing course. The House passed a Republican-led funding bill, which included additional security funding. House Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Democrats for potential shutdowns, while Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries argued Republicans would own any shutdown. Both Senate bills failed to gain enough votes. Democrats focused on extending healthcare subsidies and reversing Medicaid cuts, while Republicans aimed for short-term funding. Congress is out of session next week, with the Senate returning on September 29 and House Republicans not planning to return until October. Democrats are demanding negotiations, while Republicans accuse them of playing politics.
