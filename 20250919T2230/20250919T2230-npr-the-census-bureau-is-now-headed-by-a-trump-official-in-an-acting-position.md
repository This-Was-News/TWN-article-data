## Article summary
The U.S. Census Bureau now has a new acting director, George Cook, a Trump administration official who also serves as the Commerce Department's acting undersecretary for economic affairs and chief of staff. Cook's appointment comes amid President Trump's controversial call for a new census excluding residents without legal status, a move that would require congressional authorization. The bureau's previous director, Robert Santos, resigned early, and Trump has yet to name a permanent replacement. Cook's appointment has raised concerns, as he lacks the required qualifications for the role, and his political loyalty is seen as a potential issue. The bureau, responsible for critical data on the U.S. economy and population, has faced a wave of departures by career civil servants, raising concerns about its ability to produce reliable statistics. The Trump administration's actions, including the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, have sparked fears of political interference in federal data.
