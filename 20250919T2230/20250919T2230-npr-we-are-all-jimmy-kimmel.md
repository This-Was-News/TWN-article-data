## Article summary
Late-night talk show hosts expressed concerns about free speech after ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel's show off the air following pressure from the Trump administration. Kimmel's comments about the suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing angered the administration, leading to threats from FCC Chair Brendan Carr. President Trump suggested other late-night shows should also be pulled. Hosts like Seth Meyers, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and David Letterman criticized the administration's actions, with Colbert stating, 'Tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel.' The suspension came amid mergers involving CBS and Nexstar Media Group, raising questions about corporate compliance with political pressures. Stewart and Meyers joked about the situation while also expressing serious concerns about free speech. Jimmy Fallon expressed hope that Kimmel would return, noting worries about censorship.
