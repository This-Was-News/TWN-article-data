## Article summary
Grocery prices have surged by 3.2% over the past year, outpacing overall inflation and causing significant stress for 53% of Americans, according to a survey by The Associated Press and NORC. The pandemic disrupted supply chains, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine further exacerbated food prices globally. Recent spikes in egg prices due to avian flu and President Trump's tariffs on imported foods like bananas and coffee have also contributed to the rising costs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a 29% increase in grocery prices since February 2020. Retired nurse Shelia Fields and her husband are among those struggling, carefully shopping for sales and worrying about outliving their savings. Bank worker Rebecca White is also affected, opting for cheaper meals and skipping breakfast to manage costs. Kroger supermarket chain notes increased use of coupons and private-label products as shoppers adapt to higher prices. Food economist David Ortega highlights the political sensitivity of grocery prices, which have become a significant issue. Despite President Trump's promises to lower prices, grocery costs remain higher than when he took office. His immigration policies and tariffs are expected to further drive up prices. Coffee prices have risen over 20% in the past year, partly due to weather conditions in producing countries and Trump's import taxes. Many Americans, like Shelia Fields, are feeling the strain and adjusting their consumption habits to cope with the ongoing financial pressure.
