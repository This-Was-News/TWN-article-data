## Article summary
A federal vaccine advisory group, appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., debated changes to COVID-19 vaccine access in a chaotic meeting. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) ultimately backed away from a controversial proposal to require prescriptions for COVID-19 vaccines but recommended vaccination for adults 65 and older and younger people under 'shared decision making.' The recommendation means the COVID-19 vaccine could be less available than in previous years. The group also voted to add information about possible risks and uncertainties related to COVID vaccine effectiveness to information sheets. The meeting highlighted the politicized nature of vaccine policy under Kennedy's leadership, which conflicts with major medical organizations. Some committee members warned that requiring prescriptions would lead to fewer people getting shots and create access problems, especially for underinsured individuals. Kennedy had previously fired the existing ACIP panel and replaced them with his own appointees, some of whom have been critical of vaccines. The meeting was marked by disorganization and confusion, with concerns raised about the sidelining of expert input and the use of preliminary data. States and insurance companies have taken actions to mitigate the impact of ACIP's decisions, with some states forming alliances to issue their own vaccine recommendations. The CDC generally adopts the panel's recommendations, but they are not final until acting CDC director Jim O'Neill signs off on them.
