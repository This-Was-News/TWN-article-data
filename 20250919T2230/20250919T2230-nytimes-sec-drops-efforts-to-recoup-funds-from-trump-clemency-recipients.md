## Article summary
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped civil enforcement cases against three men who were previously granted clemency by President Trump. These men—Devon Archer, Trevor Milton, and Carlos Watson—were convicted in fraud schemes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. Archer was ordered to pay nearly $60 million, Milton over $660 million, and Watson nearly $97 million. Trump pardoned Archer and Milton, and commuted Watson's sentence, sparing them from prison time and most restitution. The SEC's decision means they will not have to pay additional civil penalties, though private lawsuits from victims remain possible. The dismissals highlight how Trump has used his power to aid affluent allies facing federal legal issues. The SEC's actions, while technically independent, reflect Trump's priorities. Trump's pardons have disrupted the typical process of restitution and forfeiture, as he has pardoned individuals before they could begin serving their sentences or paying victims. The SEC's dismissals also included Mark Kuhrt, who was convicted in a Ponzi scheme and had his sentence commuted by President Biden. Both Trump and Biden have faced criticism for their clemency decisions, with Trump more systematically rewarding loyalty and grievance.
