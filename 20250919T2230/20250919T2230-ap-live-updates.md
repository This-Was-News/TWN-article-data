## Article summary
President Donald Trump signed a proclamation overhauling the H-1B visa program, introducing a new $100,000 annual fee and other changes aimed at addressing concerns about the program's use for lower-paid, entry-level jobs. The move comes as Trump also announced plans to end the temporary protected status for about 4,000 Syrians in the U.S. Meanwhile, Trump discussed various topics, including autism research, COVID-19 vaccines, and potential government shutdowns. He also addressed international issues, such as the situation in Syria, the war in Ukraine, and a military strike on a Venezuelan boat suspected of drug trafficking. Additionally, Trump commented on the FCC's involvement in Jimmy Kimmel's suspension and the ongoing negotiations over TikTok's U.S. operations. The House passed a resolution honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk, though it faced opposition from some Democrats. The Trump administration also sought to halt a judge's order allowing transgender and nonbinary people to choose their passport sex markers.
