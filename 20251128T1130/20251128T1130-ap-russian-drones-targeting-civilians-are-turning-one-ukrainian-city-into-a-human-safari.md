## Article summary
In Kherson, Ukraine, residents live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks, turning the city into a "human safari." First-person view (FPV) drones equipped with cameras are used to target civilians, a tactic that has spread to other regions along the Dnipro River. The United Nations has concluded that these attacks, which have killed and wounded civilians and destroyed homes, amount to crimes against humanity. Locals describe the area as a testing ground where people are deliberately hunted. The sheer volume of drones, with hundreds flying over Kherson daily, poses a significant threat, although Ukrainian forces claim to neutralize over 90% of them. Drone attacks have become the leading cause of civilian casualties near the front line, with thousands injured and homes damaged or destroyed. Even celebrities like Angelina Jolie have noted the pervasive and constant threat. Medical professionals describe the injuries as severe, ranging from amputations to fatal wounds, and highlight that people in the affected areas are simply surviving, not living. Despite the ongoing terror, residents express a determination to endure, holding onto the hope for peace.
