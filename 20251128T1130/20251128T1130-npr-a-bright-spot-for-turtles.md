## Article summary
Olive ridley sea turtles in India are experiencing a significant recovery, with nest counts rising from under 100,000 to about a million in recent years. This resurgence is largely attributed to conservation efforts like seasonal fishing bans, protected coastal zones, and eco-tourism initiatives such as the Velas Turtle Festival. These festivals attract visitors eager to witness the release of hatchlings from protected hatcheries, providing a vital source of income for local communities. However, the species still faces considerable threats, including entanglement in fishing nets, particularly from illegal trawlers, and the ingestion of plastic pollution. Experts also worry that the rebounding population might lead to pressure to relax conservation protections. The legacy of conservationist Satish Bhaskar, who walked thousands of miles to study turtles, continues to inspire new generations of conservationists like Mohan Upadhye, founder of the Velas Turtle Festival. Upadhye hopes to pass on the torch of conservation to future generations, emphasizing the importance of awareness and continued efforts to protect these vulnerable creatures. Despite the progress, challenges remain, including managing waste generated by tourism and preventing further habitat destruction. The story of the olive ridley's recovery in India highlights the impact of dedicated conservation work but also underscores the ongoing need for vigilance against emerging threats.
