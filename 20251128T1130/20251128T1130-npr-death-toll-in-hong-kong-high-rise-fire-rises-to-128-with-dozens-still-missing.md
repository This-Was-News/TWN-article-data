## Article summary
A devastating fire ripped through the Wang Fuk Court high-rise housing complex in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 128 deaths and leaving dozens still missing. The blaze, one of the region's deadliest in decades, also injured 76 people, including a firefighter. Investigations suggest the fire alarms may not have functioned correctly. Three men have been arrested for manslaughter in connection with the incident. The Wang Fuk Court complex, home to approximately 4,600 residents, presented significant challenges for firefighters due to its height and the dense urban environment. The fire spread to a nearby school, and many residents were displaced, with about 1,000 housed in community shelters. The buildings, constructed in 1983, were encased in bamboo scaffolding, a material Hong Kong had begun phasing out due to fire safety concerns. China's leader Xi Jinping extended condolences to the victims' families. The death toll is expected to rise as rescue efforts continue and critically injured individuals are being treated. Comparisons have been drawn to the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London.
