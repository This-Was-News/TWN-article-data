## Article summary
Rahmanullah Lakanwal's life took a violent turn in Washington, D.C., where he is accused of shooting two National Guard troops, critically wounding one who later died. Lakanwal's journey began in Afghanistan, where he grew up during the U.S. war and later joined a CIA-backed paramilitary unit known as a Zero Unit. These units were involved in sensitive operations but also faced accusations of human rights violations. Following the Taliban's takeover in 2021, Lakanwal, along with his family, was evacuated to the United States through Operation Allies Welcome. They resettled in Bellingham, Washington, where he worked as a delivery driver and received asylum in April. The motive behind the D.C. shooting remains unclear, but a childhood friend mentioned Lakanwal suffered from mental health issues and was disturbed by the casualties his unit caused. Authorities are investigating the circumstances that led him to commit this act after resettling in the U.S.
