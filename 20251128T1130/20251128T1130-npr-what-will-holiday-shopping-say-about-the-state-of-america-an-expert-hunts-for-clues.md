## Article summary
Retail expert Katie Thomas observes that holiday shopping trends reflect a broader societal desire for control amidst economic uncertainty and global instability. Despite low consumer sentiment, retail spending continues to rise, driven by a psychological need for agency. Thomas identifies a new consumer archetype: the "frugal consumer," who is not just penny-pinching but strategically allocating their money, time, and energy due to widespread exhaustion. This manifests in various ways, including boycotts, a shift to store brands, and a resurgence of maximalism and bold aesthetics in fashion and home decor, symbolizing a desire to "feel seen" and express individuality. While wealthier individuals are propping up much of the spending, wage growth also contributes to the overall retail boom. However, shoppers are becoming more discerning, prioritizing value and skipping impulse purchases, leading to a potential need for deeper discounts from retailers. This careful selection indicates a shift from the pandemic-era's uninhibited spending sprees towards more intentional purchasing decisions.
