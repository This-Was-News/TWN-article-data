## Article summary
The man accused of shooting two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously served in an elite Afghan counterterrorism unit, NDS-03, which operated with direct CIA support. AfghanEvac, a nonprofit run by U.S. veterans, stated that this unit fought the Taliban on behalf of the U.S. government. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed Lakanwal was admitted to the U.S. in 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. government, including the CIA. Lakanwal arrived in the U.S. under humanitarian parole after being evacuated by the U.S. military and was granted asylum in April 2025. FBI Director Kash Patel indicated that Lakanwal's relationship with U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan would be a key part of the investigation. Patel also suggested that Lakanwal was admitted without proper vetting, a claim AfghanEvac countered by noting that asylum and special immigrant visa applications involve extensive vetting processes, including by the CIA. AfghanEvac founder Shawn VanDiver emphasized that it's too early to determine if there was a vetting failure and cautioned against generalizing about the entire Afghan community. The organization stressed that this violent act does not represent the Afghan community, which contributes to the U.S. and undergoes rigorous vetting.
