## Article summary
The Department of Transportation (DOT) has announced new regulations aimed at making commercial trucking safer by imposing stricter rules for obtaining commercial driver's licenses (CDLs). This initiative was prompted by a series of fatal crashes involving foreign-born truckers, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stating the current licensing process is "broken" and a "national emergency." Duffy expressed concerns that some foreign-born truckers lack proficiency in English and an understanding of road rules, posing a threat to public safety. However, critics argue that there is no data to support the claim that foreign-born truckers are inherently less safe than native-born drivers. They contend that the DOT's crackdown is essentially an immigration enforcement measure disguised as a safety initiative. The new regulations could potentially push up to 200,000 immigrant truckers out of the industry. California has already begun revoking thousands of CDLs that do not comply with state law regarding work authorization expiration dates. The DOT is also threatening to withhold federal funds from Pennsylvania over similar concerns. Despite a federal audit finding no link between a trucker's origin and their driving record, the DOT is pushing to make the emergency rule permanent, though a temporary block has been placed by a panel of judges due to a legal challenge. The situation has led to concerns that the administration is targeting immigrant drivers, particularly Sikhs, who are a significant presence in the trucking industry.
