## Article summary
Black Friday, traditionally the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season, is approaching amidst mixed signals about the U.S. economy. While consumer confidence has dipped due to factors like government shutdowns and inflation, many retail executives observe that consumers remain willing to spend on key occasions. Despite concerns about the economy, shoppers are becoming more discerning and price-sensitive, yet they continue to spend, suggesting a potential "halo effect" for the holidays. Retailers have navigated challenges such as tariffs by accelerating shipments or absorbing costs, leading to price increases on some goods, particularly toys. Nevertheless, there is positive momentum heading into Black Friday week, with foot traffic at major malls and online sales showing robust growth. Online spending has already increased significantly, exceeding initial forecasts. While consumer sentiment is cautious, current spending patterns indicate that shoppers are still engaging with the holiday season. Black Friday is expected to be the prime day for purchasing TVs, toys, and appliances online, while Cyber Monday is anticipated to offer the best deals on apparel and computers.
