## Article summary
Israeli forces have killed two Palestinian men in the occupied West Bank after they appeared to surrender, sparking accusations of a cold-blooded execution. The Israeli military stated it is investigating the incident, which was captured on video. This event occurs amidst an intensified Israeli offensive in the West Bank, where the army has increased its activities over the past two years, leading to Palestinian and human rights group accusations of excessive force and the killing of unarmed civilians. The Israeli military claims the men were wanted militants who had thrown explosives and opened fire. However, videos suggest the men surrendered before being shot. The Palestinian prime minister's office condemned the act as an extrajudicial killing. The incident is part of a broader military operation in the northeastern West Bank, which has seen over 100 detentions. Separately, Israel carried out airstrikes on suspected Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon. In another development, a Palestinian-American teenager, held for nine months, was released from Israeli detention, reportedly in a visibly weakened state.
