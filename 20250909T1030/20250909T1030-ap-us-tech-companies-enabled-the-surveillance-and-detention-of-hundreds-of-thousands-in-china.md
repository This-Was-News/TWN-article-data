## Article summary
The web page discusses how U.S. tech companies have enabled China's extensive surveillance and detention systems, particularly targeting groups like the Yang family in rural China. The Yangs, who are farmers, have been monitored and restricted due to their attempts to petition the government over land seizures. The article reveals that U.S. companies like IBM, Dell, and others have sold billions of dollars worth of technology to Chinese authorities, despite warnings about human rights abuses. This technology has been used to track and detain individuals, including Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and has contributed to a vast digital surveillance apparatus. The Yang family's struggles highlight the oppressive nature of this system, which uses data from various sources to predict and prevent dissent. The article also notes that while some U.S. companies have stopped selling to Chinese police, loopholes and lagging regulations allow the technology to continue being misused. The Yangs' story underscores the broader implications of U.S. tech involvement in China's surveillance state.
