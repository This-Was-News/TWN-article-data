## Article summary
A recent AP-NORC/Harris poll reveals that most U.S. adults believe personal choices are a major driver of poverty and homelessness, while fewer blame a lack of government support. Despite this, over half think the government spends too little on those in need. The poll comes amid rising homelessness and efforts by officials to clear encampments, with a GOP tax bill expected to reduce benefits for low-income individuals. Many Americans perceive poverty as increasing, though official data shows a decrease in poverty rates over the past 25 years. The discrepancy may stem from the visible rise in unsheltered homelessness. Most Americans favor removing homeless encampments, with Republicans more supportive than Democrats and independents. Opinions are divided on the root causes of poverty, with Republicans emphasizing personal choices and Democrats highlighting lack of government support. Substance abuse and mental health issues are seen as key drivers of homelessness. A majority believe the government should spend more on assistance, and most think federal and state governments have a major role in addressing these issues.
