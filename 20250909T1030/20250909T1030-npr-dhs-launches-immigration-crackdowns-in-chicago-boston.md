## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has launched immigration enforcement operations in Illinois and Massachusetts, targeting undocumented immigrants. The Illinois operation, named 'Operation Midway Blitz,' is in honor of Kate Abraham, a 20-year-old allegedly killed by an undocumented immigrant. DHS claims the operation targets criminal undocumented immigrants who have taken advantage of Illinois' sanctuary policies. Meanwhile, National Guard troops are patrolling Washington, D.C., despite a 30-year low in crime. The Supreme Court has also sided with President Trump, allowing immigration raids in Los Angeles. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has criticized Trump's threats against Chicago, while Senator Tammy Duckworth has called the federal operations wasteful and inhumane. Residents in Chicago have expressed deep concern about the increased immigration enforcement. DHS has also confirmed a second immigration enforcement surge in Massachusetts, specifically targeting Boston's sanctuary laws. This follows a previous operation that resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests. Trump has also threatened to send troops to Baltimore and New Orleans.
