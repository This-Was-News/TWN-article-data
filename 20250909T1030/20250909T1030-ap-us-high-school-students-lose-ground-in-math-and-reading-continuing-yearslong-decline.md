## Article summary
A recent report reveals a decade-long decline in U.S. high school students' reading and math performance, with 12th graders' scores dropping to their lowest level in over 20 years, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Eighth graders also saw significant losses in science skills. The assessments, the first since the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect a downward trend across grade levels and subjects. Experts attribute the decline to multiple factors, including increased screen time, shortened attention spans, and a shift in English and language arts instruction towards short texts. Education Secretary Linda McMahon highlighted the need for states to have more control over education spending. The report shows widening achievement gaps, with more students performing below basic benchmarks in math and reading. The gender gap in science and math has also re-emerged, with girls experiencing steeper declines in scores. The pandemic disrupted hands-on learning experiences, which are crucial for understanding scientific concepts. Despite the pandemic's impact, experts note that falling scores are part of a longer-term trend in education.
