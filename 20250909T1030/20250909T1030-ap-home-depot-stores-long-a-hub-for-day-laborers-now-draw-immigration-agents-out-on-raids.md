## Article summary
Home Depot stores in Southern California, long known as informal job-seeking hubs for day laborers, have become prime targets for immigration raids. Federal agents have conducted at least five raids this summer at a Home Depot in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, rounding up immigrants and sending others fleeing. The Supreme Court recently allowed these raids to continue, despite lawsuits from immigrant advocates. Day laborers and activists use whistles and radios to warn each other of potential raids, but agents often arrive in unmarked vans. The raids have caused disruptions, with one man killed while fleeing agents near a Home Depot in Monrovia. Home Depot denies involvement in immigration enforcement but advises employees to report any suspected activity. The company's reliance on contractors for half its business makes its stores attractive to day laborers. Foot traffic at Los Angeles Home Depots declined significantly in June and July, possibly due to the raids. Despite the disruptions, day laborers continue to gather at these locations for work and community support.
