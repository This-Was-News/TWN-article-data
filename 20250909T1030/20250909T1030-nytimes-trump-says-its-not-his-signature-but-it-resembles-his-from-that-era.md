## Article summary
A web page discusses a comparison of Donald Trump's signatures, focusing on a birthday card for Jeffrey Epstein. Taylor Budowich, deputy chief of staff for communications, shared recent photos of Trump's signature on social media. The signature on the Epstein card, which only includes Trump's first name, resembles those in personal letters he wrote to New York City officials between 1987 and 2001. These letters, obtained by The New York Times from city archives, show Trump signing only his first name, with a distinctive long tail following the 'd' in 'Donald.' This feature is not typically present when he signs with both his first and last names. The documents were retrieved during research for Times articles and a book by reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig. Buettner is an investigative reporter who has extensively covered Trump's finances, while Lazaro Gamio is a graphics editor who uses data visualization to report the news.
