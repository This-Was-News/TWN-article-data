## Article summary
The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), known as the Nation's Report Card, shows declines in student performance. Eighth-graders' science scores dropped 4 points since 2019, while 12th-graders' math and reading scores fell 3 points. These tests were administered between January and March 2024, marking the first release since the Trump administration cut funding to the U.S. Department of Education. These cuts included laying off over half the workers at the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), which oversees NAEP data. The department also canceled several national and state assessments through 2032. NAEP, mandated by Congress, is the largest nationally representative test of student learning. Reading scores for 12th-graders declined, except among the highest-achieving students, with today's average score 10 points lower than in 1992. Math scores also dropped 3 points compared to 2005. The 2024 assessment tested reading comprehension and surveyed students about learning opportunities. The federal government lacks power over school curricula, leaving states responsible for addressing these issues. Despite staffing challenges due to budget cuts, the Department of Education plans to add staff to meet future testing mandates. The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) has also reduced the number of planned assessments to focus on key areas like math and reading.
