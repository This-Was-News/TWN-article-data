## Article summary
The Israeli military has ordered a full evacuation of Gaza City ahead of an expanded offensive, marking the first such widespread warning in the current conflict. While there has been some movement of people and supplies southward, no large-scale evacuation has been observed. Israel has demolished numerous high-rise buildings in Gaza, accusing Hamas of using them for military infrastructure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have highlighted the destruction of these structures as part of Israel's intensified operations. The military aims to take control of Hamas' last stronghold, urging Palestinians to move to a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. However, previous evacuation warnings have had limited impact due to exhaustion and uncertainty among the population. An estimated 1 million Palestinians remain in northern Gaza, with nearly 50,000 having fled south since the offensive began. Humanitarian groups warn of overcrowded displacement sites and the high cost of relocation. The United Nations and Red Cross have expressed concerns about the feasibility of a safe and dignified mass evacuation. Meanwhile, malnutrition-related deaths continue to rise, with 259 adults and 140 children reported dead since late June and October 2023, respectively. The conflict began with Hamas' attack on October 7, 2023, leading to a retaliatory offensive by Israel that has resulted in significant civilian casualties and displacement.
