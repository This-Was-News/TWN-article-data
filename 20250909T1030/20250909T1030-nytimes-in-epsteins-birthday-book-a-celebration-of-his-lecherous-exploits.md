## Article summary
A 238-page birthday book for Jeffrey Epstein, compiled by his then-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, was released by the House Oversight Committee. The book, dedicated to Epstein on his 50th birthday in 2003, contains tributes from friends and associates that celebrate his lecherous exploits with young women. One friend compared Epstein to the main character in Ernest Hemingway's 'The Old Man and the Sea,' suggesting he 'caught' women instead of fish. Another described a degrading sexual encounter that left Epstein laughing hysterically. The book includes candid photos, drawings, and collages, as well as a handwritten letter from Epstein's mother and images of scantily clad young women. It provides a vivid portrayal of Epstein's widely known and celebrated behavior with young women by those who considered themselves his closest friends and associates. The book was part of the documents turned over by Epstein's estate after being subpoenaed by the committee.
