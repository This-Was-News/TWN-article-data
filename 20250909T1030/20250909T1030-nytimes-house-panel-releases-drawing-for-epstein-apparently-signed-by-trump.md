## Article summary
House Democrats released a sexually suggestive drawing and a note, apparently signed by Donald Trump, from Jeffrey Epstein's 2003 birthday book. The drawing, featuring a naked woman with 'Donald' written below her waist, was part of documents subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee. The release intensified scrutiny over the Trump administration's handling of Epstein files, which many right-wing supporters find unsatisfactory. Democrats seized on the drawing to renew calls for the full release of Epstein-related files, while the White House denied Trump's involvement. The drawing's signature resembles Trump's handwriting from the same time period, according to The New York Times. The birthday book contains letters and drawings from Epstein's associates, some of which depict misogynistic content. The book also includes a note from Trump, who denies writing it, and a mock check referencing Epstein's early talents. The Oversight Committee published most of the documents, including a redacted copy of the birthday book, on Monday evening. Republicans argue that the committee's investigation will provide greater transparency, while Democrats accuse them of politicizing the issue. The Epstein files have caused a rift within the Republican Party and stalled its legislative agenda.
