## Article summary
South Korea is caught in a difficult position between the United States and China due to the escalating trade war. The country's traditional policy of maintaining strategic neutrality, balancing security reliance on the U.S. with economic ties to China, is becoming increasingly untenable. President Lee Jae Myung has acknowledged that South Korea may have to choose sides, a departure from its long-standing approach. This dilemma is particularly challenging as South Korea navigates demands from the Trump administration for significant investment in the U.S., while China, its largest trading partner, warns against siding with Washington. A recent example of this pressure is China's imposition of sanctions on a South Korean shipbuilder, Hanwha Ocean, for its U.S. investments. Despite preliminary trade agreements, South Korea has hesitated on some U.S. demands, such as large cash investments, citing potential currency destabilization. Meanwhile, South Korea's crucial semiconductor industry is also becoming a focal point, with U.S. export restrictions on advanced chips and China's investment in its own chip manufacturing creating future competitive challenges. The situation highlights the complex geopolitical and economic pressures South Korea faces in a fragmented global economy.
