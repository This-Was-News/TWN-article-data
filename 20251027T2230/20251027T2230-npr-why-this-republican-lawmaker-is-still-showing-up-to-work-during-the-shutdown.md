## Article summary
Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican from California, is continuing to work in his Capitol Hill office despite the government shutdown and Speaker Mike Johnson's decision to recess the House. Kiley believes it's crucial to remain engaged in constructive conversations to resolve the shutdown, which he argues is harming constituents and freezing legislative work. He criticizes the recess as ineffective and emphasizes the need for bipartisan cooperation to find common ground. Kiley also supports seating Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva without delay and is open to negotiating on Affordable Care Act subsidies, a sticking point for Democrats. He continues to show up to work as a symbolic act, asserting that a functioning House of Representatives is essential, especially during a shutdown that is impacting citizens through issues like lost food assistance and flight delays.
