## Article summary
The Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court to allow the firing of the head of the U.S. Copyright Office, Shira Perlmutter. A federal appeals court previously ruled that Perlmutter could not be unilaterally fired, a decision the full appeals court declined to reconsider. This case is part of a larger legal battle over the Trump administration's authority to remove heads of federal agencies. The Copyright Office, while within the Library of Congress, is argued by the administration to wield executive power in copyright regulation. Perlmutter claims her termination in May was due to advice she provided to Congress regarding artificial intelligence. The appellate court's majority opinion, written by judges appointed by President Biden, cited a violation of the separation of powers. A dissenting judge, appointed by Trump, argued that Perlmutter exercises executive power. Perlmutter, a copyright expert, was appointed in October 2020 by then-Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. Trump had appointed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to replace Hayden, who was fired amidst conservative criticism.
