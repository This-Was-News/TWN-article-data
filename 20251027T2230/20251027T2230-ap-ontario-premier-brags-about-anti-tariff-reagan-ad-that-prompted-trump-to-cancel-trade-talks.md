## Article summary
Ontario Premier Doug Ford is bragging about an anti-tariff advertisement that he believes prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to cancel trade talks with Canada. Ford stated the ad had over a billion impressions globally and successfully initiated a conversation about tariffs in the U.S. The advertisement featured a speech from former U.S. President Ronald Reagan to criticize Trump's tariffs. This infuriated Trump, who threatened to increase tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10% and canceled upcoming meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Ford pulled the ad on Monday, but it had aired during the World Series over the weekend. Trump asserted that both provincial and federal Canadian governments were aware of the ad. Ford, a Conservative, expressed that Trump had not yet imposed the extra tariff and emphasized his goal was to protect auto jobs. He described the ad as the "best ad I ever ran" and claimed his objectives were met. Ford also commented on the fear Republicans have of Trump. Prime Minister Carney indicated that negotiations were progressing before the ads aired, after which the situation changed, and expressed readiness to continue discussions with Trump.
