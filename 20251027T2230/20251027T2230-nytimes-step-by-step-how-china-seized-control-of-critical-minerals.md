## Article summary
China has implemented a series of stringent export controls on critical minerals, particularly rare earth metals, which are essential for manufacturing a wide range of high-tech products and military equipment. These minerals, with China being the dominant global supplier, grant Beijing significant leverage in international trade. The controls began with detailed documentation requirements for exporters and expanded to include restrictions on non-rare earth minerals like gallium and germanium. China then imposed export controls on several rare earth elements and magnets, leading to production delays and shortages for manufacturers worldwide. Further measures included halting the transfer of rare earth technical secrets, restricting exports of processing equipment and battery manufacturing materials, and controlling the trade of magnets made outside China if they contain Chinese rare earths. These actions are seen as a strategic move to safeguard China's near-monopoly in the rare earth industry and exert influence over global supply chains, impacting sectors from semiconductors to electric vehicles and even military applications. The controls have become a major point of contention in U.S.-China trade relations, with potential implications for international security and economic stability.
