## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa is posing a severe threat of catastrophic flash flooding and landslides across Jamaica, Cuba, and Hispaniola. Landslides, which cause significant global casualties annually, are triggered by factors like heavy rain, earthquakes, and soil disturbances. Melissa's slow movement, path over mountainous terrain, and potential for up to 40 inches of rainfall significantly increase landslide risk. Experts note that heavy rainfall exacerbates soil weakness, leading to landslides, especially in areas with steep slopes and where vegetation has been cleared for agriculture. Jamaica, in particular, identifies landslides as its most common natural hazard. Hispaniola and Cuba are also vulnerable due to their mountainous geography and seismic activity. Past hurricanes like Fiona and Maria have demonstrated how landslides can damage infrastructure, such as roads built on steep slopes, creating access issues and further exacerbating the problem. The combination of increased landslide probability and the blocking of essential routes presents a critical challenge for affected regions.
