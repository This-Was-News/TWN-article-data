## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump has arrived in Japan for the second leg of his Asia tour, following his attendance at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur. He is scheduled to meet with Japan's newly elected Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, who is the country's first female leader. This meeting comes shortly after Takaichi took office, and she may aim to foster a personal connection with Trump to address trade tensions between the two nations. One proposal from the Japanese government to ease these tensions is the potential purchase of a fleet of American Ford F-150 trucks. Trump has expressed enthusiasm for this idea, viewing it as a positive development for his administration, which has sought greater access for American vehicles in the Japanese market. The president's busy schedule in Japan also includes addressing U.S. troops on an aircraft carrier and engaging with business leaders. Meanwhile, in a separate development, Democratic senators are seeking a cost assessment from the Congressional Budget Office regarding the deployment of the National Guard into American cities for security purposes. They have also raised concerns about the transparency and justification of these deployments. Additionally, issues have arisen with Healthcare.gov regarding the display of health insurance plans and pricing for the upcoming enrollment period, with a banner directing users to return for more accurate estimates. Many states operating their own health insurance marketplaces have already indicated that premiums are expected to increase significantly next year due to rising healthcare costs and the expiration of subsidies that have previously made plans more affordable.
