## Article summary
Finland is experiencing a stubbornly low birth rate, with its total fertility rate falling to historic lows, well below the replacement level needed to maintain a steady population. This trend, mirrored across Europe and globally, is prompting a reevaluation of societal structures and future demographics. Despite generous government support for families, including paid parental leave, subsidized childcare, and the iconic baby boxes, birth rates continue to decline. Researchers are puzzled by this phenomenon, as traditional family policies seem insufficient to explain the low fertility rates. Several factors are believed to contribute to this decline, including young people prioritizing education and careers, delaying childbirth, and facing challenges in forming stable relationships, with some attributing a role to technology. Concerns about the state of the world, such as climate change and economic instability, also influence decisions about having children. While immigration has partially offset population decline, worries persist about an aging population and a shrinking workforce. Experts suggest there is no single cause or solution, emphasizing the need to understand and support the wishes of younger generations regarding family formation. For individuals like Poa Pohjola and Wilhelm Blomberg, the decision to have a child is weighed against global uncertainties, yet the desire for family persists.
