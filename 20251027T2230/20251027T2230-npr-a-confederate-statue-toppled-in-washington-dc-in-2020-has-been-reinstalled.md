## Article summary
A statue of Confederate General Albert Pike, toppled during Black Lives Matter protests in June 2020, has been reinstalled in Washington, D.C.'s Judiciary Square. The National Park Service stated the restoration aligns with federal responsibilities for historic preservation and beautification of the capital. Erected in 1901, the monument has long been controversial, with the D.C. Council advocating for its removal since 1992. The statue is the only one in D.C. honoring a Confederate general, though it omits his military history. Historians suggest Pike may have been involved with the Ku Klux Klan's formation post-Civil War. D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton strongly objects to the reinstallation, calling it an affront to the district's residents and military members. Norton highlighted Pike's "dishonorable" service, including taking up arms against the U.S. and resigning in disgrace. She argues Confederate statues should be museum pieces, not public memorials, and has introduced legislation to permanently remove the Pike statue.
