## Article summary
The Center Square is investigating potential fraud in Washington State's taxpayer-subsidized daycare centers, with some facilities receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants and subsidies but appearing to have no children present. This investigation comes amid a federal probe into similar fraud in Somali-run facilities in Minnesota. Several daycare centers in Federal Way, including Eyow Childcare Inc., Brightstar Early Learning, and Wonder Kidz, received significant taxpayer funding between July and November 2025. When journalists visited these locations, operators were either hostile, refused to answer questions, or claimed to be expecting children soon. One homeowner called the police when approached by reporters. State Representative Jim Walsh suggested that stricter financial reporting requirements for organizations receiving state funds, similar to those for political campaigns, could help prevent such fraud. The Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF) has stated it will investigate the questionable locations and emphasized that child safety is a priority. While some comments suggest the empty facilities might be due to the holiday period, the investigation into potential misuse of taxpayer funds is ongoing, with other journalists also working to uncover more information.
