## Article summary
A volunteer member of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard was killed in a western province during widening demonstrations sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy. This marks the first reported fatality among security forces during the protests. The 21-year-old volunteer was part of the Guards Basij force. Authorities blamed demonstrators for the death, stating that 13 other Basij members and police officers were injured. The protests are attributed to economic pressures, inflation, and currency fluctuations. The demonstrations took place in the city of Kouhdasht, southwest of Tehran. Iran's civilian government under President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to signal a desire to negotiate with protesters, but the country's rial currency has rapidly depreciated. State television reported the arrests of seven individuals, including alleged monarchists and those linked to European-based groups, and the confiscation of 100 smuggled pistols. These protests are the most significant in Iran since 2022, following the death of Mahsa Amini. The government declared Wednesday a public holiday, possibly to reduce participation in the protests. Demonstrators have been chanting against the theocracy, amidst ongoing tensions with Israel and warnings from U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Iran's atomic program.
