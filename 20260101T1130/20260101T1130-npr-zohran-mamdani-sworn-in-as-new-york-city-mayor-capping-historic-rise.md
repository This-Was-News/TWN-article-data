## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City's 112th mayor in a ceremony held in a historic subway station, marking his rapid ascent from state lawmaker to the city's first Muslim mayor. His victory in 2025 occurred amidst a political climate shaped by restrictive immigration policies, highlighting his triumph as an immigrant's success story. Despite criticism from figures like Donald Trump, who labeled him a "communist," Mamdani defeated former Democratic titan Andrew Cuomo. His campaign focused on affordability, promising initiatives like free bus service, universal child care, government-run grocery stores, and rent freezes. Mamdani also garnered support from diverse groups, including influential Jewish leaders, and even received a promise of support from Trump following his election. While ambitious, his policy proposals may require state-level cooperation, though some, like free childcare, have already signaled potential support from Governor Kathy Hochul. Mamdani has also focused on building an experienced team, retaining NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch, though a recent appointment withdrawal due to past social media posts indicates potential challenges. A larger public ceremony is planned for later on New Year's Day, with notable political figures expected to attend.
