## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, the new mayor of New York City, has appointed Michael Flynn as the next commissioner of the Department of Transportation, with a central focus on making the city's bus system faster and free. This initiative was a key part of Mamdani's election campaign. Flynn, a seasoned transit official and consultant, was introduced by Mamdani at his swearing-in ceremony held in the old City Hall subway station. Mamdani emphasized the importance of public transit to the city's vitality and legacy, vowing to make its streetscape and transit system the "envy of the world." Flynn expressed confidence in the Department of Transportation's staff to achieve the administration's ambitious agenda. While making buses free is a goal outside of Flynn's direct control, as it requires coordination with the state and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, he has significant power to improve bus speed. This can be achieved through road modifications and the expansion of protected bus and bike lanes, a task that Mamdani's administration is legally obligated to pursue. The previous administration under Mayor Eric Adams fell short of its goals for bus and bike lane installations. Transit advocates have welcomed Flynn's appointment, viewing him as a highly qualified individual capable of balancing the multifaceted demands of the role and advancing Mamdani's transit improvement goals.
