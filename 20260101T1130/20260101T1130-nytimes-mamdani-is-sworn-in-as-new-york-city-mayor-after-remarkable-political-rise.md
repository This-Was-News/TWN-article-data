## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as the new mayor of New York City in an intimate ceremony at the old City Hall subway station, just after midnight on Thursday. The event marked the culmination of his rapid rise from state lawmaker to a prominent political figure, becoming the city's first Muslim and South Asian mayor. Mamdani, known for his focus on affordability and charm, took the oath of office with his hand on two Qurans, one belonging to his grandfather and the other to historian Arturo Schomburg. State Attorney General Letitia James administered the oath, highlighting the symbolic significance of the moment. The choice of the abandoned, ornate subway station as the venue underscored Mamdani's commitment to public transit and the city's legacy. A larger public inauguration is scheduled for later on Thursday, featuring Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Mamdani's platform includes ambitious plans for universal day care, rent freezes, and free city buses, though the financial feasibility of these initiatives remains a significant challenge. He also faces the complexities of managing a large city workforce, addressing issues of affordability, and navigating sensitive political and social dynamics, including his past stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Despite the monumental tasks ahead, Mamdani's supporters express hope for his compassionate and honest leadership. The swearing-in ceremony concluded with Mamdani entering his new offices at City Hall, ready to begin his term.
