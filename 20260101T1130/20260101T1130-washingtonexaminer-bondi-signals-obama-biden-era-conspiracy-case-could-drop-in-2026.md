## Article summary
Attorney General Pam Bondi has indicated that a Justice Department investigation into alleged "lawfare" spanning the Obama and Biden administrations could reach a conclusion in 2026. Bondi stated that prosecutors are actively investigating what she described as a decade-long conspiracy to protect Democrats from scrutiny while targeting Republicans, including Donald Trump. This inquiry views alleged abuses of law enforcement and intelligence authority not as isolated incidents but as part of a coordinated effort dating back to the Trump-Russia investigation. The framing of the investigation mirrors a memo by FBI Director Kash Patel, suggesting a "continuing conspiracy" approach to potentially bypass statutes of limitation. While the specific locations of the investigation are not disclosed, officials suggest a significant portion is centered in Florida, where the FBI searched Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. A grand jury in Fort Pierce, Florida, is scheduled to convene in January 2026, though the subject of its proceedings is not specified in court orders. Bondi criticized former CIA Director John Brennan for seeking judicial intervention to block potential cases involving him from being assigned to a specific judge. Brennan's attorneys reportedly sent a letter to the chief judge of the Southern District of Florida, seeking to prevent any future case involving him from being assigned to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon. Bondi asserted that such actions demonstrate concern about "liability" and an attempt to preserve a "two-tiered justice system." Reports also indicate that Brennan, along with former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, have been subpoenaed as part of this investigation. While criminal charges are not guaranteed, the attorney general's framing and the impending grand jury suggest the investigation is entering a critical phase.
