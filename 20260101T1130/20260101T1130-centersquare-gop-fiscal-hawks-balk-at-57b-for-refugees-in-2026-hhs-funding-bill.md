## Article summary
Two Republican senators, Mike Lee and Rand Paul, are opposing the Labor-HHS funding bill for fiscal year 2026, which includes $5.69 billion for refugee assistance services. While this amount is less than the $6.3 billion allocated in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, it is triple the funding levels seen before President Biden's term. Congressional funding for Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs significantly increased starting in fiscal year 2022, rising from $1.91 billion in 2021 to $4.8 billion. This funding continued to be over $6 billion annually in subsequent years. Senate Majority Leader John Thune plans to bring a five-bill appropriations minibus, including the Labor-HHS bill, to a vote upon Congress's return. This bipartisan package also covers funding for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Defense, Commerce, Justice, and Science, and the Interior. If these bills are not passed in some form by February 1, the deadline for the current Continuing Resolution, a partial government shutdown could occur. The article highlights the tension between fiscal conservatives concerned about spending levels and the legislative necessity of passing appropriations bills to avoid a shutdown.
