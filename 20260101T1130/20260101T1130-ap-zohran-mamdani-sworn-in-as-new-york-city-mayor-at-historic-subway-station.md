## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani has been sworn in as the new mayor of New York City, marking a historic moment as the city's first Muslim mayor. The oath of office was administered in a private ceremony at the decommissioned Old City Hall subway station. Mamdani, a Democrat, is also the city's first mayor of South Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. At 34, he is the youngest mayor in generations. His platform focused on affordability, promising policies such as free child care, free buses, and a rent freeze. Mamdani, who grew up in Queens after his family moved from Uganda when he was seven, aims to bring transformative change to the city. He will also have a public swearing-in ceremony at City Hall, followed by a block party. Mamdani inherits a city recovering from the pandemic, with declining crime rates and returning tourism, but still facing challenges with high prices and rents. He will also navigate a relationship with Republican President Donald Trump, who has expressed both threats and a willingness to help. Mamdani also faces scrutiny from some in the Jewish community due to his criticisms of the Israeli government.
