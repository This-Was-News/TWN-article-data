## Article summary
Nick Shirley, a 23-year-old independent YouTube journalist, has gone viral for a video alleging $110 million in fraud by federally funded day care centers in Minnesota. The video, posted on X and YouTube, shows Shirley and a companion questioning Somali employees at various day care centers. The Trump administration has responded by freezing child care funding to Minnesota, a move amplified by prominent conservatives like Elon Musk and members of the Trump administration. However, Shirley's allegations have not been independently verified, with some day care managers stating he visited outside of operating hours. Shirley, who began his YouTube career with pranks, has increasingly focused on political content since returning from a two-year Mormon mission in 2023. His work often involves man-on-the-street interviews on topics like immigration and protests. He was invited to a White House roundtable in October, where he described himself as an "independent YouTube journalist" and criticized the mainstream media for allegedly downplaying protests. Experts suggest that while independent journalism can be valuable, some "news influencers" like Shirley may prioritize narrative over fact-checking. Shirley is also selling merchandise and soliciting donations for his security, citing safety concerns.
