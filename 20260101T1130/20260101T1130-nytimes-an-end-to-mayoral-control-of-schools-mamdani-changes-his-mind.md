## Article summary
Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has reversed his stance on ending mayoral control of New York City public schools, announcing he will seek an extension of his authority over the system. While previously critical of the model for limiting input from teachers, parents, and students, Mamdani now emphasizes the need for mayoral accountability in school outcomes. He plans to implement a "tangible and actionable" approach to community involvement, moving beyond ceremonial inclusion. This shift comes as Mamdani formally appointed Kamar Samuels as his chancellor, a decision he believes will bring transformative leadership to the nation's largest school system. Samuels, who will oversee a $40 billion budget and over 1,500 schools, faces significant challenges including a reading curriculum overhaul, widespread student homelessness, and high rates of chronic absenteeism. Mamdani's decision is seen by some education leaders as a positive step towards clear leadership and direct responsibility, while others, like education advocate Leonie Haimson, express concern that it may limit parent and teacher input. The mayoral control model, established under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has enabled large-scale changes but has also faced criticism for its centralized power structure.
