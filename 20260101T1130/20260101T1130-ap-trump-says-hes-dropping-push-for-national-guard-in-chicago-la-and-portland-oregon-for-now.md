## Article summary
President Donald Trump has announced he is dropping his push to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, Oregon, for the time being. This decision comes after facing significant legal challenges that hindered the deployment. Trump stated that he might revisit the issue in the future if crime rates rise. Governors typically control their states' National Guards, and Trump had deployed troops to these cities against the wishes of local Democratic leaders, framing it as a necessary part of his immigration and crime crackdown. The troops had already departed Los Angeles, and their presence in Chicago and Portland was blocked by legal actions before they could be deployed to the streets. Officials in Portland and Chicago credited their local law enforcement and public safety programs for crime reduction. The Supreme Court had previously refused to allow the deployment in Chicago, and a federal judge permanently blocked the deployment in Portland. Governors of Illinois and Oregon expressed relief and viewed Trump's decision as a victory for the rule of law. The federalization of National Guard troops in California also faced legal setbacks, with courts ordering control to be returned to the state. While the push for troops in these specific cities is being dropped, National Guard troops remain deployed in other cities like Washington, D.C., and Memphis, with varying degrees of local support and legal challenges.
