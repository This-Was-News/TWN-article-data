## Article summary
The U.S. Southern Command announced it conducted five strikes against suspected drug trafficking vessels in international waters on December 30th and 31st. The strikes, ordered by War Secretary Pete Hegseth, targeted three vessels traveling as a convoy on December 30th and two separate vessels on December 31st. During the strike on the convoy, alleged drug traffickers jumped overboard into the ocean after their vessels were targeted. Three individuals were killed in the convoy strike, and five were killed in the subsequent strikes. The U.S. Coast Guard has initiated search and rescue operations for those who abandoned the vessels, with their current status unclear. These actions are part of an escalated effort against drug traffickers, particularly aimed at pressuring the government of Venezuela. The total number of individuals killed in such strikes has now surpassed 100. A C-130 aircraft is en route to assist in the search efforts.
