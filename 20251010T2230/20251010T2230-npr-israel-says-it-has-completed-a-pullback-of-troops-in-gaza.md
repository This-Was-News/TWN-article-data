## Article summary
Israel has completed a pullback of troops from Gaza following the Cabinet's approval of a ceasefire plan to end the two-year-old war. The agreement includes the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israeli forces have begun withdrawing from parts of Gaza, particularly in Gaza City and Khan Younis. The ceasefire began upon Cabinet approval, with troops retreating to a buffer zone. Palestinian residents are hopeful about returning to their homes despite the destruction. The war, sparked by Hamas' attack on Israel two years ago, has resulted in significant casualties on both sides. A U.N. commission recently determined that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, a claim Israel rejects. The ceasefire raises questions about governance, reconstruction, and Hamas' weapons. The U.S. will contribute troops to support and monitor the ceasefire, along with other countries like Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE. President Trump is expected to visit the region, and the ceasefire aims to allow food and medicine to flow into Gaza, where famine has been declared.
