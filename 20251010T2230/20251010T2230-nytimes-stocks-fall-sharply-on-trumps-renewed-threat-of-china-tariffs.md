## Article summary
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced significant declines, with the S&P 500 dropping 2.7 percent, its worst performance in six months, due to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. President Trump threatened additional tariffs on Chinese imports after China restricted rare earth material exports. Tech stocks, including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, were heavily impacted. U.S. oil prices also fell over 4 percent to below $59 a barrel, potentially affecting drilling activities. The market had been on edge after five consecutive months of gains, with some investors anticipating a pullback. Trump further escalated tensions by proposing a 100 percent tariff on all Chinese goods post-market. The declines marked the first time in two months the S&P 500 fell more than one percent, though it remained near record highs.
