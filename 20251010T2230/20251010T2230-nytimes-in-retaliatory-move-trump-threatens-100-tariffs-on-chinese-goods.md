## Article summary
President Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing's restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for U.S. industries. The tariffs, set to take effect on November 1, will be in addition to existing tariffs. Trump also threatened to cancel an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. will impose export controls on critical software. Markets reacted negatively, with the S&P 500 dropping over 2%. Rare earth minerals have been a point of contention, with China controlling 70% of global production. The U.S. has been trying to reduce its dependence on Chinese supplies. China's new restrictions could disrupt global supply chains. Analysts suggest China's move may have backfired, escalating tensions. The fragile truce between the two countries now seems at risk.
