## Article summary
Runners in the Chicago Marathon are concerned about potential immigration enforcement by ICE agents during the race, especially those from Hispanic or other targeted demographics. Event organizers have addressed these concerns by directing participants to a 'Know Your Rights' page. ICE has denied plans to disrupt the marathon, but past statements from officials have raised fears. The Chicago Marathon is a significant event with international participants, and the crackdown has led to reduced enthusiasm and economic impact in neighborhoods like Pilsen. Critics argue that the immigration crackdown is overreaching and involves racial profiling. Participants and local leaders express worries about the safety and economic consequences of the crackdown during the marathon.
