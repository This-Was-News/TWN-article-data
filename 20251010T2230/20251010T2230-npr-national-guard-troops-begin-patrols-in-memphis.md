## Article summary
National Guard troops have started patrolling in Memphis as part of a federal task force established by President Trump to combat crime. The task force includes agents from multiple federal agencies and was initiated after the Trump administration described Memphis as suffering from high levels of violent crime. A small number of Guard members were already in Memphis for planning purposes, but the exact number of troops to be deployed and their locations remain unclear. The Guard is operating under the governor's command, unlike in other cities where the Trump administration has activated troops. Critics accuse the administration of targeting Democratic-led cities, and legal experts worry about the limits of presidential power. The task force's priorities include reducing crime, enforcing immigration laws, and assisting local police. Governor Bill Lee stated that the troops will serve in support roles and will not be responsible for making arrests. Local leaders have expressed caution, with Memphis Mayor Paul Young questioning whether the Guard is the right tool for driving down crime. Despite recent declines in homicides and overall crime, Memphis has historically struggled with high crime levels.
