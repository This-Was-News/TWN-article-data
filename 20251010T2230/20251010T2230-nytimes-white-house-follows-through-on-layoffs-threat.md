## Article summary
President Trump has initiated federal layoffs during the government shutdown, targeting agencies and programs, with over 4,000 workers receiving notices. He threatened to weaponize the shutdown against Democrats and hinted at further layoffs. Meanwhile, Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese products and export controls on critical software in response to China's restrictions on rare earth minerals. The administration also unveiled a drug pricing deal with AstraZeneca, aiming to lower Medicaid drug prices. Additionally, Trump's administration faced legal challenges over immigration enforcement tactics in Chicago and the cancellation of a major solar project in Nevada. The stock market reacted negatively to the tariff announcement, with the S&P 500 dropping over 2%. M.I.T. rejected a Trump administration proposal that would trade support for higher education agenda in exchange for favorable treatment, citing concerns over academic freedom and free expression.
