## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, or sooner, in response to China's export controls on rare earth elements. This move could escalate tensions and disrupt global trade, potentially leading to a recession. Trump also hinted at canceling a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during an upcoming trip to South Korea. The announcement caused Wall Street to tumble, with the S&P 500 dropping 2.7%. China's restrictions on rare earths, crucial for U.S. technologies, have raised concerns about supply chain disruptions. The U.S. and China have been in a trade war, with both sides imposing high tariffs on each other's goods. The situation remains uncertain, with both sides seemingly unwilling to back down, risking further economic disruption.
