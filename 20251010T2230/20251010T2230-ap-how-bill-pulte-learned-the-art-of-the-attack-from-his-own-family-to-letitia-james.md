## Article summary
Bill Pulte, a controversial figure with a background of targeting family members and political enemies, has risen to prominence in the Trump administration. He accused relatives of various misdeeds and engaged in public disputes, including a bitter legal feud with his family's company, PulteGroup. Despite this, he secured a top government post as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Pulte has used his position to investigate political foes like New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, who deny any wrongdoing. Pulte's rise to power began with his grandfather's homebuilding empire, but his adult life has been marked by controversies, including disputes with a veterans charity and allegations of being a charlatan. He gained a massive Twitter following through philanthropy but faced backlash and legal issues. Pulte's aggressive campaigns against his family and company officials led to a defamation lawsuit and public harassment allegations. After Trump's 2024 election win, Pulte deleted thousands of social media posts and withdrew his lawsuit, focusing instead on his role in the Trump administration. He has since spearheaded investigations into mortgage fraud by Trump's rivals, while refusing to comment on similar conduct by Trump allies.
