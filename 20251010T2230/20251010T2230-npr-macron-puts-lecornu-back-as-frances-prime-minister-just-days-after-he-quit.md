## Article summary
French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister just days after his resignation, aiming to form a government and produce a budget to end the country's political deadlock. Lecornu's return follows intense negotiations and comes amid France's economic challenges, including mounting debt and a poverty rate of 15.4%. Macron's office announced the appointment, marking his last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lecornu accepted the role out of duty, promising to address daily problems and end the political crisis. He also stated that new Cabinet members must renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027. The political instability has raised alarms across the European Union, with France's public debt reaching 3.346 trillion euros. Opposition parties demand fresh elections or Macron's resignation, while Lecornu believes a working government is still possible. The deadlock stems from Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024, resulting in a hung parliament. Lecornu will need to seek compromises to avoid a vote of no confidence and may abandon the unpopular pension reform. The crisis highlights the fragility of Macron's coalition and the need for stable support to address France's economic and political challenges.
