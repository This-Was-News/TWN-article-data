## Article summary
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect in Gaza on Friday, following Israel's Cabinet approval of a deal to pause fighting and exchange remaining hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Tens of thousands of Palestinians began returning to their homes in northern Gaza after the Israeli military's announcement. The ceasefire marks a significant step toward ending a two-year war that has devastated Gaza, killed tens of thousands, and left dozens of hostages. The broader plan includes unanswered questions about Hamas's disarmament and Gaza's governance. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that Hamas will disarm and Gaza will be demilitarized. The International Committee of the Red Cross is preparing for the hostage and prisoner release, which is expected to be challenging due to the tight timeframe. The European Commission is ready to provide aid and support reconstruction efforts if the ceasefire holds. Palestinians who left Gaza will be able to return after security checks. Italian police will resume patrolling the Rafah border crossing. Netanyahu stated that Israel is achieving its goal of returning the hostages, with around 20 believed to be alive. In exchange, Israel will release around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Despite the ceasefire, some Palestinians remain cautious about immediately returning home due to ongoing shelling and safety concerns.
