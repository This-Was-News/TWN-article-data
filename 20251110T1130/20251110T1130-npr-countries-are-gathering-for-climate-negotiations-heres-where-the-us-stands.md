## Article summary
Nearly 200 countries are gathering in Belém, Brazil, for COP30, the annual United Nations climate summit. However, the United States will not have high-level officials attending, marking a departure from tradition. The Trump administration has adopted a strong anti-climate stance, withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and rolling back numerous environmental and climate policies. These actions include targeting the EPA's "endangerment finding" for greenhouse gases, proposing to repeal limits on power plant emissions, and reducing federal support for renewable energy projects. The administration has also canceled grants for climate initiatives and slashed funding for climate science research at agencies like NOAA and NASA. This shift in policy comes as extreme weather events are increasing in intensity and frequency. Experts warn that discontinuing U.S. climate efforts could lead to a significant increase in global warming. The administration's actions have led to concerns about the U.S. government's reliability as a partner in climate action and potential negative impacts on economic growth and utility bills.
