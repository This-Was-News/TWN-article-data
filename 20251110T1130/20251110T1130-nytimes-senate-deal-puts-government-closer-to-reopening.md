## Article summary
The Senate has taken a significant step towards ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history by voting to advance legislation that would reopen the government and fund most federal agencies through January. This move, however, still requires passage in the House and the President's signature. The compromise includes funding for various programs and provisions for retroactive pay for federal workers. Despite this progress, several House Democrats have stated they will not support the deal, though Republican unity could ensure its passage. The deal notably omits the extension of health insurance subsidies, a key demand for Democrats, which has caused division within the party. Meanwhile, the shutdown has exacerbated issues like disruptions to food stamp benefits and widespread flight cancellations due to air traffic controller shortages. Global markets reacted positively to the news, reflecting investor relief. The ongoing shutdown has impacted millions of Americans, from federal workers facing furloughs to those relying on essential services like SNAP. The Federal Aviation Administration has implemented flight restrictions to mitigate the impact of staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, leading to thousands of flight cancellations and delays, with further disruptions expected as the Thanksgiving travel season approaches.
