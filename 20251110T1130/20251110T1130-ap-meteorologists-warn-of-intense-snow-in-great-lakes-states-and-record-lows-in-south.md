## Article summary
Large parts of the U.S. are bracing for the season's first significant winter weather event, with heavy snow expected in the Great Lakes region and plummeting temperatures anticipated in the South. Chicago and surrounding areas are preparing for intense snowfall, with predictions of up to 18 inches and wind gusts up to 30 mph, potentially creating dangerous travel conditions. Thundersnow, a rare phenomenon combining thunderstorms and snow, is also a possibility. Other Great Lakes states, including Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin, are under winter weather advisories, expecting considerable snowfall and hazardous roads. Meanwhile, the South, from Texas to Georgia, is facing a sharp drop in temperatures, with freezing conditions predicted. Meteorologists have also issued warnings for gardeners, indicating the end of the growing season due to the anticipated frost. Further north, parts of Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota are experiencing blowing snow and near-zero wind chills. This widespread wintry blast marks a significant shift in weather patterns across the country.
