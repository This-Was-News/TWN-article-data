## Article summary
A bipartisan group in the Senate has reached a deal to reopen the government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The agreement would fund the government through January 30 and include full-year funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 30, 2026. The Senate voted 60-40 to advance the measure, marking a crucial step towards ending the shutdown. The legislation, however, still needs to pass the House. Democrats had previously opposed short-term spending measures to preserve healthcare subsidies, but some agreed to the new framework as the shutdown's impact grew. The continuing resolution includes provisions for reversing federal employee layoffs and providing backpay. Senator Tim Kaine stated the deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. An informal agreement also suggests a Senate vote on healthcare by early December. Despite this, some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Representative Elizabeth Warren, oppose the compromise, viewing it as a capitulation. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also vowed to vote against the bill in the House, criticizing its failure to extend ACA tax credits. The Senate deal follows recent Democratic electoral victories, which some believe have emboldened the party to continue fighting for healthcare extensions.
