## Article summary
A deal has been reached in the Senate to end the longest government shutdown in history, following a 60-to-40 vote that allows for formal debate on the spending measure. While this is a significant step, the package still requires House approval and the President's signature. The shutdown's end, however, has revealed key takeaways for both parties. Democratic unity, which had held for 40 days under Senator Chuck Schumer, ultimately crumbled without securing an extension of health insurance subsidies. Moderate Democrats broke ranks, citing the suffering caused by the shutdown and a promise of a future vote on the subsidies. This division highlighted ongoing tensions within the party, with some House Democrats criticizing the deal as insufficient. Health care is expected to remain a central political issue, with Democrats planning to continue pressuring Republicans on rising premiums. President Trump largely stayed on the sidelines, encouraging Republicans to hold firm, while House Speaker Mike Johnson marginalized himself and his chamber by insisting the House had already acted. Despite the political maneuvering, Democrats did secure some concessions, including provisions to restore jobs for federal workers and protect the Government Accountability Office from funding cuts. The deal's success hinged on the growing consequences of the shutdown, which affected not only federal employees but also millions of Americans relying on SNAP benefits and air travel.
