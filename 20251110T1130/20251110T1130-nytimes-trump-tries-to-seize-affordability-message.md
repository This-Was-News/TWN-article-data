## Article summary
President Trump has been actively campaigning on the issue of affordability, promising to lower costs across various sectors if re-elected. He has vowed to tackle issues ranging from car and housing affordability to insurance costs and supply chain problems, aiming to make America affordable again. However, recent Democratic electoral victories, which focused on lowering the cost of living, have presented a challenge to Trump's economic message. He has expressed frustration and confusion regarding the issue, at times calling affordability a "new word" and criticizing Democrats for using it as a "con job." Trump and his administration are attempting to regain control of the affordability narrative, which has resonated with voters who are increasingly dissatisfied with the current economic agenda. The shifting dynamics around the affordability issue highlight its significance in the upcoming political landscape.
