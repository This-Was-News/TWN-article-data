## Article summary
Three years after its liberation from a nine-month Russian occupation, Kherson, Ukraine, now endures a tense stillness under constant threat from across the Dnipro River. The city, once vibrant with celebratory crowds, has adapted to a new reality where daily life often occurs underground or behind reinforced structures to mitigate the persistent danger of Russian shelling and drone attacks. Residents like florist Olha Komanytska strive to maintain a semblance of normalcy, though their livelihoods and safety are precarious, with greenhouses destroyed and personal tragedies linked to the war's toll. Protective measures, such as anti-drone netting stretched across streets and hospitals, have become commonplace, reflecting the city's ongoing siege. Behind the scenes, electronic warfare units work to intercept and disable a high volume of incoming drones, playing a critical role in defending the city. To preserve a sense of normalcy for children, activities like chess clubs and boxing practices have moved to former basements, offering a safe space for socialization and skill development. Despite the pervasive fear and the limitations on social and outdoor activities, the residents of Kherson demonstrate resilience, finding ways to live and connect amidst the ongoing conflict. The city, marked by billboards proclaiming "City of strength, freedom and resilience," continues to exist as a frontline city, a testament to its inhabitants' determination to survive.
