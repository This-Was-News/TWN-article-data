## Article summary
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Israel on Sunday as Israeli strikes intensified in northern Gaza, killing at least 12 Palestinians. Rubio aims to seek answers from Israeli officials about the way forward in Gaza following Israel's attack on Hamas operatives in Qatar, which disrupted ceasefire efforts. His visit also shows support for Israel amid a contentious U.N. debate on the creation of a Palestinian state, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes. Despite President Donald Trump's anger over Israel's unannounced strike in Doha, Rubio's visit highlights the Trump administration's efforts to balance relations between key Middle East allies. The attack in Doha has stalled ceasefire and hostage release negotiations ahead of the U.N. General Assembly session. On Sunday, Israeli strikes killed at least 13 Palestinians, including a family of six in Der al-Balah. The Israeli military destroyed a high-rise residential building in Gaza City, with residents accusing Israel of genocidal measures. Meanwhile, malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza have risen, with 277 adults and 145 children dying since late June and the start of the war in October 2023, respectively. The conflict began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,803 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, with around half being women and children, and has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population.
