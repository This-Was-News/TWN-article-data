## Article summary
Venezuela accused the U.S. Navy of boarding a Venezuelan tuna boat with nine fishermen in Venezuelan waters, escalating tensions between the two nations. The incident involved a U.S. destroyer and 18 armed personnel who stayed on the vessel for eight hours, preventing communication and normal activities. Venezuela's foreign minister, Yván Gil, condemned the action as illegal and hostile, presenting photos and a video of the incident. Gil alleged that the U.S. seeks an incident to justify military escalation in the Caribbean, aiming to persist in its failed policy of regime change in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government warned it would defend its sovereignty against any provocation. This incident follows recent tensions, including U.S. President Donald Trump's deployment of warships in the Caribbean to combat Latin American drug cartels and his claim of attacking a drug-laden vessel linked to the Tren de Aragua gang. Venezuela accused the U.S. of extrajudicial killings, with Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello calling the U.S. version a lie. The Trump administration has accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of leading a drug cartel and doubled the reward for his capture. Despite no indication of a ground incursion, Venezuela has called on citizens to enlist in militias to support security forces in case of a potential U.S. attack.
