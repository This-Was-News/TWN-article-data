## Article summary
Donald Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born in 1912 on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. The island has a history of emigration, with many locals leaving for opportunities abroad. Mary Anne was part of this trend, moving to New York in the early 20th century. She initially worked as a maid or nanny and later returned to Scotland before meeting and marrying Fred Trump, a real estate developer. Mary Anne's journey from poverty to a transformed life in America is seen as a rags-to-riches story. The Isle of Lewis is known for its Gaelic culture and a strong sense of homesickness among those who left. The island's emigration history is documented in a museum at Lews Castle. Trump's state visit to the UK coincides with a visit to his mother's homeland, where his maternal family roots go back centuries. Locals have mixed feelings about Trump but are proud of his mother's success. Mary Anne visited the Isle of Lewis frequently and maintained ties with her homeland. Trump has visited Scotland multiple times but has not returned to his mother's home island since a brief visit in 2008.
