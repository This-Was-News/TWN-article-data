## Article summary
The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has left authorities seeking more information about the motive behind the attack. Tyler James Robinson, 22, from Washington, Utah, has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder and other felony offenses. Prosecutors are preparing formal charges for his first court appearance next week. Investigators have spoken to Robinson's relatives and searched his family's home. While authorities have not provided many details about the motive, Utah Governor Spencer Cox mentioned that Robinson's family reported his increasing political engagement and discussions about Kirk's visit. Robinson, registered to vote but not affiliated with a political party, had ammunition with anti-fascist and meme-culture messages. He grew up in St. George, Utah, and was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Despite being an honor roll student and initially attending Utah State University on a scholarship, he left after one semester and is now in an electrical apprenticeship program. The shooting has sparked calls for greater civility in political discourse, with several individuals facing consequences for their comments about Kirk. Turning Point USA, Kirk's organization, will hold a memorial for him on September 21 in Phoenix. Kirk's widow, Erka Kirk, vowed to continue his work, and a makeshift memorial has been set up at the university.
