## Article summary
The Trump administration has launched a pilot program to accelerate the use of electric air taxis, aiming to establish U.S. dominance in airspace technology. The Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop new frameworks and regulations for safe operations and form partnerships with private companies, state, and local governments. The program will include at least five pilot projects over three years, focusing on electric air taxis (eVTOLs) for cargo delivery, emergency situations, and passenger transport. The aircraft will be tested both manned and unmanned before completing FAA certification. This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis, as Joby Aviation received approval for test flights in June 2023. Both Joby and Archer Aviation have announced plans to participate in the program, aiming to demonstrate the safety and maturity of their aircraft. The FAA is accepting proposals and will select a minimum of five participants.
