## Article summary
A far-right rally in London, organized by activist Tommy Robinson, drew over 110,000 people and turned violent as clashes broke out between supporters and police. Police reported injuries to officers and arrests for violent disorder and assault. The rally, themed around free speech and anti-immigration sentiments, was countered by a smaller 'March Against Fascism' protest. Speakers, including far-right figures from Europe and Elon Musk, condemned immigration and criticized the UK government. Participants carried British flags and chanted slogans like 'We want our country back.' Counterprotesters held signs supporting refugees and opposing the far-right. The event highlighted ongoing tensions in the UK over immigration and national identity, with both sides expressing strong views. Despite the large turnout, the rally was smaller than recent pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Robinson, known for his controversial activism, has a history of legal issues, including jail time for contempt of court.
