## Article summary
Two NATO intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon designed to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation. This weapon would create orbiting clouds of shrapnel, aiming to disrupt Western space superiority that has aided Ukraine. The proposed "zone-effect" weapon could disable multiple satellites but risks catastrophic collateral damage to other space systems. Analysts express skepticism, questioning the weapon's viability without causing uncontrollable chaos in space. However, the commander of Canada's military Space Division noted that such Russian development is not implausible, given previous allegations of other space weapon pursuits. Russia views Starlink as a threat, especially given its use by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications and targeting. Russia has also recently fielded a ground-based missile system capable of hitting low-orbit targets. Unlike previous tests, this new weapon would target multiple Starlinks simultaneously using pellets. Experts worry that such an attack could create uncontrollable debris, endangering other satellites, including the International Space Station and China's space station. The pellets are reportedly small enough to evade detection, complicating attribution of any attack. While the weapon's development stage and testing status are unclear, its potential use could serve as a "weapon of fear" for deterrence. However, analysts suggest the significant risks to Russia's own space assets might deter its deployment.
