## Article summary
A judge has scolded Ghislaine Maxwell for including confidential victim names in court papers as she seeks to overturn her sex trafficking conviction and 20-year prison sentence. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer stated that exhibits filed with Maxwell's habeas petition will be sealed and kept out of public view until they are reviewed and redacted to protect victim identities. He also reminded Maxwell that she is prohibited from identifying victims in any public filings who were not publicly named during her trial. Maxwell filed the petition last Wednesday, just before the Justice Department began releasing investigative records related to her and Jeffrey Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Maxwell claims that exculpatory information was withheld and false testimony was presented during her trial, leading to a miscarriage of justice. The Justice Department's release of records has been slow and heavily redacted, with a focus on protecting victim identities. This approach has angered some accusers and lawmakers, leading to calls for legal action to compel full disclosure. Some documents, including a photograph of Donald Trump with Epstein and Maxwell, were temporarily removed from public view due to concerns about potentially showing victims, but were later restored. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche defended the department's cautious approach to releasing sensitive information and denied any attempt to protect Trump.
