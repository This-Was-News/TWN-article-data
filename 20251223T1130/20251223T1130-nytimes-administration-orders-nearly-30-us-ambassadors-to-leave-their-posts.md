## Article summary
The Trump administration has ordered approximately 30 U.S. ambassadors, all career foreign service officers appointed by the Biden administration, to return to the United States by mid-January. This mass recall is unprecedented in the history of the U.S. Foreign Service. Ambassadors were reportedly notified abruptly and without explanation, a process described as highly irregular and lacking transparency. The State Department stated that recalling ambassadors is a standard process, allowing the president to appoint individuals who advance the "America First" agenda. However, this action deviates from the norm for career diplomats, who typically serve into new administrations. The union representing these diplomats has expressed concern about the impact on morale, especially following a survey indicating a significant decline in morale among career diplomats since the beginning of Trump's second term. The survey also revealed issues with tighter budgets, greater workloads, and difficulties in carrying out U.S. foreign policy. This follows previous actions such as layoffs within the State Department and the reassignment of senior diplomats. The recall could leave numerous ambassadorships vacant, potentially impacting the U.S. diplomatic presence globally.
