## Article summary
Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its refusal to accept funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The states argue that the administration's stance, based on a narrow interpretation of the Federal Reserve's "combined earnings," risks defunding the agency by January 2026. This potential lack of funding could significantly harm consumers in their states, as the CFPB is crucial for processing complaints and sharing data with state authorities. Acting Director Russell Vought claims the Fed has no "combined earnings" due to operating at a loss, but the states and some lawmakers dispute this interpretation. They contend that the original intent was to include wider funds from the Fed. New York Attorney General Letitia James, leading the coalition, emphasized that defunding the CFPB would impede efforts to combat predatory lenders and scammers. The CFPB, established after the 2008 financial crisis, has faced criticism from conservatives who view it as overly aggressive and unaccountable. Previous attempts by the Trump administration to gut the agency and fire staff have been thwarted by the courts.
