## Article summary
President Trump has announced the construction of a new "Trump class" of warships, aiming to create a "golden fleet" for the U.S. Navy. He described current Navy vessels as old, tired, and obsolete, disparaging the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. The new ships, envisioned as battleships, would be significantly larger than current surface combatants, displacing over 35,000 tons, and capable of launching hypersonic and nuclear-armed cruise missiles. Trump stated these vessels would maintain American military supremacy, revive the shipbuilding industry, and intimidate adversaries. This initiative reflects Trump's past criticisms of the Navy's fleet and his desire to return to World War II-era battleship designs, even proposing renaming the Department of Defense to the "Department of War." This move also aligns with a pattern of Trump imprinting his brand on federal institutions, similar to the renaming of the John F. Kennedy Center. While Trump claims involvement in the design, the proposed warships would forgo large guns in favor of missiles, including hypersonic and electromagnetic rail guns, and may not meet congressional requirements for supporting Marines ashore. Critics, such as retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, argue that these large "behemoths" are ill-suited for confronting China and that a dispersed fleet of smaller, unmanned ships would be more effective. Trump expects two of these vessels to be built within two and a half years, with a potential total of 20, and plans to meet with defense contractors to accelerate production.
