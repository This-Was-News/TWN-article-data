## Article summary
Senator Richard Blumenthal is investigating the funding and design of President Trump's White House ballroom project. He has sent letters to individuals invited to a donor dinner and the architect overseeing the project, seeking details on donations, costs, and design plans. Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts of interest as the project's cost has escalated from an initial $200 million to $400 million. The Trump administration has agreed to submit plans for review by oversight bodies amid a lawsuit to block the project. Blumenthal is questioning whether donors have received preferential treatment from the administration, citing instances where donors to the ballroom and other Trump projects have benefited from presidential actions. One notable donation of $5 million came from David Baszucki, CEO of Roblox, who was asked if the contribution amount was suggested by Trump officials. Another invitee, lawyer John P. Coale, who previously represented Trump, attended the dinner after YouTube donated $22 million to the project to settle a lawsuit. While some invitees have not responded, others have defended their involvement, dismissing suggestions of quid pro quo.
