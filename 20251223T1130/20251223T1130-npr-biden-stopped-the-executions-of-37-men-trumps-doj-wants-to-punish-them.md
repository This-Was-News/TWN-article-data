## Article summary
After President Biden commuted the death sentences of 37 men to life in prison, the Trump administration has taken steps to punish them, despite violating federal policy. Ten of these men have been transferred to ADX Florence, a maximum-security prison in Colorado known for extreme solitary confinement. Two others face renewed death penalty charges in state courts, and two more face charges in Florida. The remaining prisoners are in limbo, expecting a transfer to ADX, a situation that has reportedly driven at least one prisoner to attempt suicide. Critics argue these actions are punitive and potentially unconstitutional, as they disregard established federal guidelines for prisoner placement, which consider health needs and proximity to family. The Trump administration, however, defends the transfers, citing the severity of the prisoners' crimes. Lawyers for the ACLU represent 21 of the 37 prisoners, claiming their clients are being treated as "pawns caught in the crossfire." The policy violations include reclassifying prisoners' health needs to match ADX's lower care level requirements and disregarding the policy to place inmates within 500 miles of their primary residence. The extreme isolation at ADX has been linked to severe mental distress and self-harm among inmates. Prisoners and their advocates express deep concern over the psychological toll of these transfers, with some inmates contemplating suicide rather than endure the conditions at ADX.
