## Article summary
A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government denied due process to Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia stated that these individuals deserved the right to a hearing to argue against their removal. The Trump administration had invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in March to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward challenged these deportations, arguing the act was invoked illegally. Judge Boasberg agreed that the men were denied their due-process rights and ordered the government to facilitate their ability to obtain a hearing. The ruling mandates that the administration must either facilitate their return to the U.S. or provide them with hearings that satisfy due process requirements by January 5. The judge emphasized that even if the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was lawful, the men should have had a meaningful opportunity to prove they were not gang members. Boasberg also found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for violating a previous order to stop the deportations. The ruling certified the deported individuals as a class, allowing the plaintiffs to represent the entire group. The government is expected to appeal this decision.
