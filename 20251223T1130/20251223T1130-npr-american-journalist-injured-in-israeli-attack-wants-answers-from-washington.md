## Article summary
American journalist Dylan Collins is seeking answers from Washington after being injured in an Israeli tank attack in southern Lebanon on October 13, 2023. The attack killed Reuters cameraman Issam Abdallah and severely injured AFP photo editor Christina Assi, who lost a leg. Collins, who sustained injuries to his head, arms, and torso, believes the attack was deliberate, citing findings from organizations like Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists. Despite evidence suggesting a targeted strike, Collins has found little support from the U.S. government, including the State Department and FBI. He has pressed both the Biden and Trump administrations for accountability, but has been met with a lack of engagement. Collins's congressional delegation from Vermont has advocated for an independent investigation under the War Crimes Act, to which the State Department responded by calling on Israel to investigate. Christina Assi, who is undergoing rehabilitation, believes the attacks on journalists are systematic and intended to instill fear and eliminate reporting. The Committee to Protect Journalists has labeled such attacks as 'war crimes,' noting the high number of journalists killed since the start of the conflict.
