## Article summary
A 30-hour manhunt for the gunman who shot and killed Charlie Kirk ended with the suspect, Tyler Robinson, 22, in custody. Authorities believe Robinson acted alone and was apprehended after a family friend alerted officials based on his confession. Robinson is being held on suspicion of aggravated murder and other felonies. The shooting occurred at Utah Valley University, and the arrest was made in Washington County, Utah. Investigators found engraved messages on unfired cartridges near the campus, suggesting familiarity with antifascist symbolism and internet memes. Governor Spencer Cox of Utah urged calm and forgiveness, contrasting with President Trump's blame on the radical left. The suspect's family played a role in his surrender, and formal charges are expected to be filed on Tuesday. The incident has sparked widespread reactions, including calls for accountability and condemnation of political violence.
