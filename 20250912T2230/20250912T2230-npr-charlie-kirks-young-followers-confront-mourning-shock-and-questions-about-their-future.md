## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of Charlie Kirk's assassination on his young followers and the conservative movement. Isabel Brown, a conservative content creator, expressed profound grief and uncertainty about the future of the movement Kirk had built. Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA, was a mentor and friend to many young conservatives, inspiring a generation of political activists. His organization has grown significantly, with over 800 college chapters and an annual revenue of $100 million. Critics on the left viewed Kirk's brand of conservatism as offensive, citing his spread of misinformation and controversial statements. Supporters, however, highlight his role in mobilizing young people into the GOP and encouraging emerging leaders. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna credited Kirk for her political career and urged supporters to get more involved in political organizing. The assassination has raised fears among young conservatives, with some questioning their safety. Hayden Padgett, chairman of the Young Republican National Federation, emphasized the need to resist fear and push forward. Students like Alex Shepherd are already taking action, driven by their admiration for Kirk's work.
