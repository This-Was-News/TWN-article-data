## Article summary
An ICE officer fatally shot a suspect in a Chicago suburb after the suspect attempted to evade arrest by driving his car at officers and dragging one of them. The incident occurred during a period of heightened immigration enforcement by the Trump administration, targeting sanctuary jurisdictions in Chicago and Illinois. The suspect, identified as Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, had a history of reckless driving and entered the country illegally. The officer involved was injured and taken to the hospital. Homeland Security officials stated that the officer acted appropriately to protect himself and the public. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker demanded a full accounting of the incident. Immigration advocates criticized the enforcement tactics, arguing they harm communities and lack transparency. Meanwhile, Chicago prepared for Mexican Independence Day celebrations amid concerns about increased immigration enforcement. The incident follows previous deaths in Los Angeles related to ICE operations.
