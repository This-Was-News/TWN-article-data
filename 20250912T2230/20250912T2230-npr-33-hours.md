## Article summary
Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and podcaster, was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, September 10. The suspect, Tyler Robinson, was identified through surveillance footage and was seen moving across the roof of a building before shooting Kirk. The crowd dispersed in chaos, and Kirk was taken to a nearby hospital. The FBI and local law enforcement quickly secured the scene and began an investigation. By Thursday, authorities recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the murder weapon and released photos of the suspect, asking for the public's help. Over 7,000 tips were received, and nearly 200 interviews were conducted. On Friday, September 12, Governor Spencer Cox announced that Robinson had been turned in by a family member and was in custody. Authorities emphasized the swift collaboration between local, state, and federal agencies in apprehending the suspect within 33 hours.
