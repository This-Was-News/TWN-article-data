## Article summary
Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old suspect, was arrested in southwestern Utah after a friend contacted authorities. He is believed to have acted alone in the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and Trump ally, during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Robinson was taken into custody peacefully after surrendering at a sheriff's office. He faces charges including aggravated murder and felony discharge of a firearm. Utah State University confirmed he attended for one semester in 2021 as a pre-engineering major. Robinson was unaffiliated with any political party and was considered inactive in voting. His family played a crucial role in his arrest after a family member contacted authorities, suspecting his involvement. Authorities found extensive evidence linking him to the crime, including statements to relatives, social media messages, and physical evidence. Video surveillance showed him arriving near the campus in a Dodge Challenger before the attack. Cartridges found with the gun used in the shooting contained written messages, including references to antifascist themes, online culture, and gaming.
