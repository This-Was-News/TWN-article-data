## Article summary
Utah Governor Spencer Cox addressed the media after the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charle Kirk, emphasizing the need for calm and constructive dialogue among young Americans. Cox, known for his 'disagree better' philosophy, urged the younger generation to foster a culture of respectful disagreement and avoid political violence. He highlighted Kirk's willingness to engage with opposing views despite his divisive history. Cox's 'Disagree Better' campaign, launched in 2023, aims to reduce political polarization and promote healthy conflict. He has previously expressed concerns about the dark path of American democracy and has partnered with Democratic Governor Jared Polis to advocate for civil debate. Cox referenced recent violent acts against U.S. politicians, noting a significant increase in threats since 2016. Initially distancing himself from Donald Trump, Cox later endorsed Trump after the 2024 assassination attempt, believing public support was the right course of action. He wrote a letter to Trump, urging him to unite the country. Cox described Kirk's death as a political assassination and announced Utah would seek the death penalty for the suspect. He concluded by stressing the importance of safe and secure ideological clashes.
