## Article summary
President Donald Trump criticized Republican New York City mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa, dismissing him as 'not exactly prime time' and mocking his affinity for cats. Trump's comments came as pressure mounts for Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdan's rivals to drop out of the race. Mamdan is leading in polls, with Trump warning that Mamdan will likely win unless two other candidates, including Mayor Eric Adams and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, withdraw. Adams, who skipped the Democratic primary due to a dismissed federal bribery case, has no intention of stepping down. Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, defended his love for cats and his history, stating that Trump may not know much about him. Sliwa also highlighted his wife's work in animal welfare. Despite Trump's dismissal, Sliwa remains focused on his campaign, emphasizing issues important to New Yorkers, including animal welfare.
