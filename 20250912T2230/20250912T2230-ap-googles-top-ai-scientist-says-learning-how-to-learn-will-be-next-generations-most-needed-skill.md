## Article summary
Google's top AI scientist and 2024 Nobel laureate Demis Hassabis emphasized that the most crucial skill for the next generation will be learning how to learn, to adapt to rapid technological changes driven by artificial intelligence. Speaking at an ancient Roman theater in Athens, Hassabis highlighted the need for meta-skills like understanding how to learn and optimize approaches to new subjects, alongside traditional disciplines. He predicted that artificial general intelligence, which could match human capabilities, might arrive within a decade, bringing significant advancements and potential risks. Hassabis, CEO of Google's DeepMind, stressed the importance of continuous learning throughout one's career. He shared the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing AI systems that predict protein folding, a breakthrough for medicine and drug discovery. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis joined Hassabis, discussing the expansion of AI in government services and warning about potential financial inequality due to the growth of tech companies. Mitsotakis cautioned that without personal benefits from the AI revolution, skepticism and social unrest could arise. Hassabis, whose father is Greek Cypriot, rescheduled his presentation to avoid conflicting with the European basketball championship semifinal between Greece and Turkey, which Greece later lost.
