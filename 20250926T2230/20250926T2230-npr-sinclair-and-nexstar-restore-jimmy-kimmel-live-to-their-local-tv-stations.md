## Article summary
Sinclair and Nexstar Media Group have restored 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to their local TV stations after a week-long preemption following controversial comments by Jimmy Kimmel about the suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing. Both companies announced the decision to reinstate the show on Friday, Sept. 26, citing their responsibility to provide accurate and engaging programming for their communities. Sinclair, which operates ABC stations in 30 markets, made its decision after receiving feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders. Nexstar, operating in 32 ABC markets, also emphasized its commitment to First Amendment rights and unbiased broadcasting. The preemption followed Disney's suspension of the show due to Kimmel's comments, which drew criticism and a backlash from artists and the public. Despite the suspension, 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' returned to national airwaves on Tuesday, attracting over 6 million viewers and garnering 26 million online views. Both Sinclair and Nexstar clarified that their decisions were made independently of any government influence. Nexstar, currently negotiating a major merger, emphasized its commitment to reflecting the sensibilities of its communities. The restoration of the show marks the end of a controversy that highlighted the complexities of free speech and broadcasting responsibilities.
