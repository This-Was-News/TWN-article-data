## Article summary
An ICE officer in New York has been placed on administrative leave after a video showed him pushing a woman to the ground. The incident occurred at the Jacob K. Javits building, where tensions have been rising due to increased ICE presence in immigration courts. The officer involved was also part of a previous altercation with a court observer, which was witnessed by NPR. DHS condemned the officer's conduct, stating it is unacceptable and below the standards of ICE. The video shows the woman crying after her husband's arrest, with the officer yelling 'adios' before pushing her. This incident is part of a broader context of conflicts between federal agents and the public in immigration courts, as ICE has expanded its operations inside these facilities. The court observer from the previous incident was issued citations for trespassing and failing to follow lawful commands. The latest video was captured by multiple cell phones and cameras, highlighting the escalating tensions in these settings.
