## Article summary
President Donald Trump's transportation department has been withdrawing grants for recreational trails and bicycle lanes, deeming them 'hostile' to cars. The department sent letters to local governments in six states, informing them that projects funded under the 2021 infrastructure law would not move forward. This shift reflects a change from the Biden administration's focus on alternative transportation to Trump's emphasis on expanding lanes for cars and trucks. Projects affected include a 44-mile recreational trail in Connecticut, a rail trail in Albuquerque, and a streetscape transformation in Boston. The department cited a preference for promoting vehicular travel and traditional energy sources. Some projects, like a single-block safety test in San Diego and a bike trail in Illinois, were also targeted for reversal. Local officials and advocates have criticized the cuts, with some vowing to fight them in court. The department's actions are seen as unprecedented without a compelling reason, such as environmental harm.
