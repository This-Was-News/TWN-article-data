## Article summary
Michele Beckwith, the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento, was fired hours after she reminded Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino to follow court-ordered restrictions on immigration raids. Beckwith, a Democrat, had a 15-year career prosecuting serious crimes before her dismissal. She was removed from her post after she insisted that Bovino comply with a federal court order prohibiting indiscriminate arrests. The firing occurred less than six hours after she emailed Bovino about the court order. Beckwith was replaced by Kimberly Sanchez, a Republican, and later by Eric Grant, a Trump ally. The dismissal is seen as part of a pattern where Trump fired prosecutors who did not align with his political agenda. Beckwith argued that her firing was unjust and that she was acting in accordance with the law. She has appealed her termination, seeking to clear her record and receive back pay. Beckwith emphasized her commitment to justice and public service, stating she was motivated by her duty as an American. The incident highlights tensions between federal prosecutors and political pressure from the administration.
