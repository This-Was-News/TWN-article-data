## Article summary
A group of former national park superintendents has urged the Trump administration to close national parks in the event of a government shutdown, citing risks to visitor safety and park resources. They highlighted past shutdowns where parks remained open, leading to vandalism, habitat destruction, and endangerment of visitors. The current strain on parks, with a 24% staff reduction and severe budget cuts, exacerbates the situation. A directive by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to keep parks open has resulted in neglected maintenance and trash collection. The former officials argue that poorly staffed parks pose significant dangers. They emphasize the importance of having National Park Service employees to manage maintenance, educational programs, and long-term projects. The Coalition to Protect Americas National Parks supported the letter, stressing the need for fully funded and staffed parks. Colorado Governor Jared Polis has offered state funds to keep Rocky Mountain National Park open, highlighting the economic importance of national parks. Past shutdowns have shown both the economic impact of closures and the damage caused by keeping parks open with minimal staffing.
