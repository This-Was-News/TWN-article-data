## Article summary
The Justice Department is pursuing a case against former FBI Director James Comey, but securing a conviction may not be the primary goal. The administration aims to make life uncomfortable for targets of retribution, including through reputational harm and legal fees, regardless of the likelihood of a conviction. This marks a departure from the department's traditional approach of only bringing cases it believes it can win. The prosecutor overseeing the Comey investigation resigned after expressing caution about the case's prospects. The Justice Department is also investigating other Trump critics, such as New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff, both Democrats. Trump has publicly called for their prosecution, and his administration has signaled a desire for accountability against those he believes wronged him. The case against Comey was secured by a new U.S. Attorney with no prior federal prosecution experience, and the indictment was sparse, making it difficult to assess the strength of the evidence. Comey has declared his innocence and expressed eagerness for trial. Trump has publicly touted the indictment but also appeared to manage expectations, noting the judge's Democratic appointment. The administration's actions suggest that the goal may be more about retribution than securing a conviction.
