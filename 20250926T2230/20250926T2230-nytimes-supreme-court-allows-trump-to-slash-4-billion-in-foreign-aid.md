## Article summary
The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid allocated by Congress, marking a significant test of the president's authority over legislative appropriations. The conservative majority ruled that the president's foreign affairs powers may outweigh the potential harm to aid recipients, though they noted this is a temporary decision pending further litigation. The three liberal justices dissented, arguing that the matter is too important to be decided hastily without full briefing or argument. The case centers on the balance of power between the Executive and Congress regarding public funds. Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, emphasized the high stakes in determining who controls the nation's purse strings.
