## Article summary
On Thursday, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the United States would reject a U.N. political declaration on non-communicable diseases, despite expressing concern for addressing chronic diseases. The declaration, a result of years of work and negotiations, aims to prevent and control diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer, and promote mental health. RFK Jr. criticized the declaration for exceeding the U.N.'s role and ignoring pressing health issues, though he did not specify which issues. The Trump administration also expressed concerns about promoting 'radical gender ideology' and abortion, which are not addressed in the declaration. The document sets targets for 2030, including reducing tobacco users and increasing access to mental health care. While some countries and advocates have concerns about the text, there is broad support for its adoption. The World Health Organization reported overwhelming support from world leaders. RFK Jr.'s rejection is part of a broader criticism of U.N. agencies by the Trump administration, which has taken steps to withdraw the U.S. from the international body. Despite the U.S. rejection, the declaration is expected to gain wide support in the U.N. General Assembly in October, with other governments committed to moving forward with the urgent action needed.
