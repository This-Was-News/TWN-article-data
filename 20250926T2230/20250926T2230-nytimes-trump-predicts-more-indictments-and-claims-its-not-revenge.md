## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to address hundreds of U.S. generals and admirals at an unprecedented meeting at a Virginia military base. The gathering aims to rally troops and communicate Hegseth's vision for the Pentagon, including new military fitness standards. The secrecy surrounding the event has caused anxiety among top military ranks, especially given Hegseth's recent firings of senior generals and admirals. The meeting may also preview a new national defense strategy prioritizing homeland security. Vice President JD Vance downplayed the meeting's significance, while Hegseth seems to enjoy the secrecy. The Pentagon declined to provide details, and President Trump initially appeared unaware of the plans. The large-scale meeting is disruptive and expensive, requiring officers from conflict zones to attend. Some military officers question why the message couldn't be conveyed via a secure video teleconference. Experts suggest the meeting could either effectively share Hegseth's vision or prove awkward if his intentions are different.
