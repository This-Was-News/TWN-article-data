## Article summary
Starting next week, federal agents from 13 U.S. agencies, including the FBI, DEA, and ATF, along with 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers, will be deployed to Memphis as part of a federal crackdown on crime. President Trump signed a memorandum to send National Guard troops to support local law enforcement, though they will not be armed unless requested. Governor Bill Lee described the operation as a 'generational opportunity' to address crime, while Memphis Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community concerns and emphasized using resources effectively. Memphis has already been working with federal agencies to reduce crime, particularly after a spike in 2023. The city has launched a website to provide updates on the incoming federal resources. Trump has framed Memphis as overwhelmed by violent crime, similar to his actions in other Democratic-led cities like Los Angeles and D.C.
