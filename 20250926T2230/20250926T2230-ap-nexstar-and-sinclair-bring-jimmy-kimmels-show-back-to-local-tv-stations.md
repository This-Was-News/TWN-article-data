## Article summary
Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group have ended their dayslong blackout of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show, bringing it back to their local TV stations. The suspension began on September 17 due to Kimmel's remarks about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, which sparked controversy. Sinclair, known for its conservative content, demanded an apology and a donation to Kirk's nonprofit, Turning Point USA. Kimmel returned to ABC on Tuesday, acknowledging the sensitivity of his comments but not apologizing. Sinclair and Nexstar continued to preempt the show for three days after ABC's reinstatement. Both companies cited their responsibility to their communities and the importance of free speech in their decisions. The blackout affected roughly a quarter of ABC's local TV affiliates, sparking a national debate on First Amendment protections and political influence in media. Kimmel had criticized President Trump and his administration's response to Kirk's killing, angering supporters and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. The companies denied any external influence in their decisions, emphasizing their commitment to their communities and the First Amendment. Disney declined to comment on the matter.
