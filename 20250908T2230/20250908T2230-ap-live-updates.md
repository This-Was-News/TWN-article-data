## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced plans to send National Guard troops and immigration agents to Chicago, intensifying confusion and anxiety about potential federal intervention. The Department of Homeland Security launched 'Operation Midway Blitz,' though details remain unclear. Trump's threats to intervene in Chicago mark a broader struggle over federal authority in local immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, religious leaders urged Chicago residents not to fear the expected federal presence, advising them to resist, record interactions, and rely on their faith. The Supreme Court allowed federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles, a victory for Trump's administration. Additionally, Trump praised DC Mayor Muriel Bowser for collaborating on crime crackdowns, despite ideological differences. The president also addressed the Religious Liberty Commission, emphasizing the importance of prayer in public schools and criticizing the Smithsonian museums for their portrayal of American history. The federal appeals court upheld a $83.3 million defamation judgment against Trump for his attacks on E. Jean Carroll. South Korea's foreign minister traveled to the U.S. to finalize the return of detained workers following a massive immigration raid in Georgia. The Trump administration faced legal challenges over withheld foreign aid funds, and Republicans in Congress supported Trump's use of the military for domestic policy goals.
