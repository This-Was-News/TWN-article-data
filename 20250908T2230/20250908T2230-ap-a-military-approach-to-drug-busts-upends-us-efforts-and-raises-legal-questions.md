## Article summary
The U.S. Coast Guard's traditional role in intercepting drug vessels in the Caribbean may change following a U.S. military strike on a vessel off Venezuela. The Trump administration claims the strike targeted gang members smuggling drugs to America and suggests more military actions against Latin American cartels could follow. However, this approach raises legal questions, as it deviates from decades of procedures for intercepting suspected drug vessels. The strike, which reportedly killed 11 members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, has been justified by the administration as self-defense against an immediate threat. The Pentagon has not provided details about the strike, and some officials and lawmakers have criticized the lack of transparency. Legal experts argue that the strike may not be justified under international law and could be considered an act of war against Venezuela. The U.S. has historically relied on legal processes and international cooperation to combat drug trafficking, and the shift to military action could strain these relationships.
