## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, allowed the Trump administration to lift a temporary restraining order that had barred immigration agents from conducting roving patrols and profiling individuals based on appearance in Los Angeles and Southern California. The ruling permits federal agents to briefly detain and interrogate people about their immigration status using a 'totality of circumstances' standard. The case, handled through the Supreme Court's emergency docket, has significant implications for immigration enforcement nationwide. Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained the decision, noting factors like the high number of undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles and their typical work locations. The dissenting justices, appointed by Democratic presidents, objected to the decision made without oral argument. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the ruling, calling it a misuse of the court's emergency docket and accusing the Trump administration of targeting Latinos. The ruling allows Border Patrol to resume aggressive tactics, which a district court had previously ruled as violating Fourth Amendment rights. The Trump administration argued that the restraining order hindered their efforts to remove undocumented immigrants. Civil rights groups and local governments had sought the order, arguing that the raids violated people's rights by targeting those who appear Latino, including U.S. citizens. Despite the restraining order, agents continued aggressive enforcement, including a raid at a Home Depot where eight people were detained. The Trump administration's immigration policies have broader implications, including undermining the sense of belonging for Latino communities.
