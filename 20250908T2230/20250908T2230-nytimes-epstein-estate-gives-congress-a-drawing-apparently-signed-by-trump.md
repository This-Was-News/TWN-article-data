## Article summary
A sexually suggestive drawing and note, allegedly signed by President Trump, were released from the so-called Epstein birthday book. The White House denied Trump's involvement, with press secretary Karolyn Leavitt stating Trump did not draw or sign the content. The White House is pursuing a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over the report. Meanwhile, President Trump made false claims about crime rates in Washington, D.C., asserting there was virtually no crime, despite statistics showing otherwise. He also downplayed domestic violence, suggesting it should not be considered a crime. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee obtained the drawing and note, posting a photo on their official social media account. The Trump administration has been facing backlash over its handling of the Epstein files, with Republicans and Democrats at odds over the release of related materials. Additionally, the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on immigration stops in Los Angeles, drawing criticism from civil rights groups. The Trump administration has also been involved in immigration crackdowns in Chicago, with local officials and advocates reporting arrests. The Supreme Court has been receptive to the administration's emergency applications, often siding with Trump in disputes over executive authority.
