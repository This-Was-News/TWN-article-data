## Article summary
A sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein, purportedly signed by President Donald Trump, was released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. The letter was part of a 2003 birthday album for Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sexually abusing and trafficking underage girls. Trump denies writing the letter or creating the accompanying drawing of a curvaceous woman. The White House and Trump's legal team have aggressively defended him, with Trump filing a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for reporting on the letter. The release of the letter comes amid increasing pressure on Trump regarding his past association with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of luring teenage girls for Epstein. Trump has claimed he ended his friendship with Epstein decades ago after a falling-out. The House Oversight Committee received the birthday album as part of documents from Epstein's estate, which also included requests for his will, agreements with prosecutors, contact books, and financial records. The letter's disclosure has reignited bipartisan calls for the release of the so-called Epstein files, with the Justice Department beginning to turn over records to the committee.
