## Article summary
A New York Times investigation revealed that JPMorgan Chase maintained a long-standing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, despite numerous red flags and concerns from employees. Epstein was a valuable client, generating millions in revenue and introducing high-profile individuals to the bank. However, his criminal background and suspicious financial activities raised alarms. Internal emails showed that some executives were troubled by the association, with one stating, 'This is not an honorable person in any way. He should not be a client.' Despite these concerns, top executives like James Dimon and Jes Staley defended Epstein. The bank facilitated his financial dealings, including setting up accounts for his sex-trafficking operations. Epstein's access to JPMorgan's resources and influence was extensive, with the bank even paying him millions. The investigation highlights how JPMorgan ignored warnings and continued to profit from its association with Epstein, enabling his criminal activities.
