## Article summary
The estate of Jeffrey Epstein has provided the House Oversight Committee with a 2003 birthday book for Epstein, which includes a message allegedly signed by President Trump. The book, compiled by Ghislane Maxwell, contains a controversial image with Trump's signature and a typed message discussing a 'wonderful secret.' Democrats on the committee have called for the release of related files, while Trump and the White House have denied the authenticity of the signature and message, calling it 'fake news.' The book was part of documents submitted in response to a subpoena, including Epstein's will, bank account information, address book entries, and a 2007 non-prosecution agreement. The committee is reviewing the documents and plans to release further details later. Meanwhile, Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie are pushing for the release of all files related to federal investigations into Epstein.
