## Article summary
A new Gallup poll reveals shifting American views on socialism and capitalism, with Democrats increasingly favoring socialism over capitalism. Only 42% of Democrats view capitalism favorably, while 66% have a positive view of socialism. This shift reflects a gradual change in Democratic support over the past 15 years, with capitalism's image slipping and socialism rising. The poll highlights tensions within the Democratic Party about embracing socialism, as seen in the rise of figures like Zohran Mamdan and Bernie Sanders, who advocate for democratic socialism. Younger Democrats, in particular, are less likely to view capitalism favorably. The poll also shows a decline in the popularity of big business, with only 37% of U.S. adults holding a positive view, down from 49% in 2010. Republicans and Democrats have starkly different views on capitalism's fairness and its ability to meet basic needs. While capitalism's popularity has slightly declined overall, views on socialism have remained stable, with Republicans growing more negative and Democrats more positive. This shift presents a challenge for Democratic politicians who historically distanced themselves from socialist labels but now face a base increasingly drawn to the idea.
