## Article summary
The Supreme Court has lifted restrictions on immigration stops in Los Angeles, allowing federal agents to conduct sweeping operations. The conservative majority overturned a lower court's order that barred agents from making stops based solely on race, language, job, or location. The decision follows a pattern of temporarily allowing some of the Trump administration's harshest policies. Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that the lower court's restrictions were too broad, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, stating that the decision erodes constitutional freedoms. The ruling comes as ICE agents increase enforcement in Washington and Los Angeles, with over 5,200 arrests made since June. The lawsuit, filed by immigrant advocacy groups, accused the Trump administration of targeting people based on their appearance and accents. The case will continue in California, with a hearing set for September 24. Federal attorneys maintain that immigration officers target people based on legal presence, not race or ethnicity. The Supreme Court's decision has been criticized by Democratic leaders in California, who argue it allows for discriminatory practices.
