## Article summary
The article explores JPMorgan's extensive and problematic relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, revealing how the bank facilitated his sex-trafficking operations while profiting from him. Over a period when Epstein was abusing young women, JPMorgan processed thousands of transactions totaling over $1.1 billion, including payments to his victims and transfers to banks linked to his crimes. Despite red flags and internal warnings from employees, the bank continued to do business with Epstein, relying on his assurances that he had reformed. Epstein was a lucrative client, introducing new clients and advising senior executives, including Jes Staley, who had an unusually close relationship with him. Staley sought Epstein's advice on various matters and even engaged in inappropriate behavior with one of Epstein's assistants. JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, has denied knowing much about Epstein, but evidence suggests otherwise. The article highlights the bank's failure to act on concerns and its role in enabling Epstein's criminal activities.
