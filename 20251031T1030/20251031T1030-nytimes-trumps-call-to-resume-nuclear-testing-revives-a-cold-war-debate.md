## Article summary
President Trump's announcement of an order to resume U.S. nuclear testing has reignited Cold War debates about nuclear weapons. This move evokes memories of atmospheric and underground detonations during that era, characterized by threats and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, agreed upon in the mid-1990s, aimed to halt the arms race by preventing new tests, though it never formally entered into force due to insufficient ratification. Trump stated his decision was prompted by other countries conducting nuclear tests, noting the U.S. last conducted an explosive nuclear weapon test in 1992. However, the claim that other nations are regularly testing is inaccurate; only North Korea has tested in the past quarter-century, with its last test in 2017. Russia has not conducted a nuclear test in 35 years. Trump may have conflated nuclear weapons tests with Russia's recent declarations of testing advanced delivery systems, such as a nuclear-powered cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo designed to evade missile defenses. This resurgence of the testing debate raises concerns about escalating global tensions and a potential return to a more dangerous period of international relations.
