## Article summary
Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance marketplaces begins November 1st, with significant uncertainty surrounding the future of enhanced premium tax credits. These credits, which have made coverage more affordable for most enrollees and expanded eligibility, are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress intervenes. Without an extension, average premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double, potentially leading many to forgo coverage. Experts advise shoppers to pay close attention to legislative developments, as a deal to extend the credits could significantly impact their enrollment decisions. It is crucial for individuals to log in to their marketplace accounts and update income and household information accurately, as a provision in HR 1 has eliminated caps on repayment for underestimated income, meaning any excess advance premium tax credits received must be repaid in full. Automatic reenrollment is discouraged this year due to premium uncertainties, especially for those who may no longer qualify for subsidies. Health insurance premiums are expected to increase by an average of 26% next year, with a family of four earning $75,000 potentially paying over double their current premium if the enhanced credits expire. When choosing a plan, focus on the listed price and consider less generous plans with lower premiums and higher deductibles if the sticker price is unaffordable without subsidies; Bronze plans are generally recommended over being uninsured. Catastrophic plans are also an option, offering essential benefits and free preventive care but with the highest deductibles. Despite potential sticker shock, enrollees are urged not to abandon their search for coverage, as Congress may still act to extend the credits. Key enrollment deadlines vary by state, with many requiring enrollment by December 15th for January 1st coverage.
