## Article summary
King Charles III has taken decisive action to strip his brother, Prince Andrew, of all royal titles and honors, including his title as prince, in an effort to protect the monarchy. Andrew will now be known simply as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and must vacate Royal Lodge, the sprawling mansion he has occupied for over 20 years. This move comes after a series of revelations linking Andrew to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and increasing parliamentary pressure to formally remove his titles and residence. The King's decision is seen as a necessary step to draw a clear line between Andrew and the rest of the royal family, particularly as Charles, who is undergoing cancer treatment, works to solidify the monarchy's future for his heir, Prince William. The scandal was reignited by the memoir of Virginia Giuffre, who alleged sexual abuse by Andrew when she was a minor, though Andrew has consistently denied these claims. Historians suggest further disclosures may emerge, but acknowledge the King's action is a significant step. This banishment is viewed as part of a broader transition for the monarchy, making it more accountable and transparent to the public and Parliament, a shift that has become more pronounced since Queen Elizabeth II's death.
