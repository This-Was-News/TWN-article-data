## Article summary
The biggest tech companies, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon, are significantly increasing their spending on artificial intelligence, investing billions more than previously planned to meet surging demand. This accelerated spending, particularly on data centers and computing power, has raised concerns among financial analysts and the Bank of England about the potential for an A.I. bubble, given the technology's unproven nature and high costs. Despite these worries, these tech giants, with their substantial profits and existing business models, appear confident in their investments. Google plans to spend at least $91 billion this year on A.I. data center projects, while Microsoft has already spent $35 billion in its latest quarter, exceeding expectations. Meta is raising its spending forecast to at least $70 billion by year-end, and Amazon will spend $125 billion on capital expenditures this year. Federal Reserve chair Jerome H. Powell believes these A.I. investments are different from the dot-com bubble, as they are backed by established companies with proven earnings. However, the financial stability of smaller companies investing heavily in A.I. without the same safety net remains a question. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is particularly focused on building infrastructure for potential 'superintelligence,' even if it means overbuilding for current needs.
