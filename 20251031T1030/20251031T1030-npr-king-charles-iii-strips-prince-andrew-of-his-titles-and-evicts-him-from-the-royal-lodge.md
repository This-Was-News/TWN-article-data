## Article summary
King Charles III is stripping his brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicting him from his royal residence. Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and will no longer use the title of prince. He will also be required to move from his Royal Lodge residence into private accommodation. These actions follow revelations about Prince Andrew's association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Pressure had been mounting for the prince to leave Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title Duke of York earlier this month. This was due to his friendship with Epstein and allegations made by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. The king's decision goes further by removing the title of prince, which Andrew has held since birth. The palace stated that these measures are necessary, even though Prince Andrew continues to deny the allegations against him. Their Majesties expressed their deepest sympathies to victims and survivors of abuse.
