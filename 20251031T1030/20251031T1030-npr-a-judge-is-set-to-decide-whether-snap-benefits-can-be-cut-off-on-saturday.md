## Article summary
A federal judge in Boston is considering a ruling that could prevent the cutoff of SNAP benefits on Saturday, which would affect 42 million Americans. The Trump administration claims the government shutdown necessitates the suspension of these federal food assistance payments. However, Democratic governors and attorneys general from numerous states have sued the federal government, arguing that SNAP benefits are an entitlement and cannot be legally terminated. They contend that halting these payments would cause significant harm to millions of individuals and burden state governments. The administration's stance is that they are legally prohibited from using emergency funds to extend the benefits. During a court hearing, Judge Indira Talwani expressed skepticism towards this argument, highlighting that Congress had established an emergency fund intended for such situations. She suggested that Congress's intent was to protect citizens from the consequences of political disputes. Despite the potential use of the emergency fund, administration officials estimate it is insufficient to cover the full $9 billion needed for November's benefits. This shortfall could still lead to delays and reduced payments for millions of Americans, creating a logistical challenge.
