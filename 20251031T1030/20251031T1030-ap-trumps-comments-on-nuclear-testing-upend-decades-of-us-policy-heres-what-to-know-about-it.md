## Article summary
President Donald Trump's recent comments suggesting the United States will restart nuclear weapons testing have created significant global concern, potentially upending decades of American policy. This announcement comes at a time when rivals like Russia and China are actively expanding and testing their nuclear arsenals. Russia has made repeated atomic threats and recently acknowledged testing a nuclear-powered cruise missile and a nuclear-armed underwater drone. China is constructing more nuclear missile silos, and North Korea has unveiled a new intercontinental ballistic missile. Trump's statement, made on his Truth Social platform, incorrectly identified the Department of War as responsible for nuclear weapons testing, which is overseen by the Department of Energy. He also made an inaccurate claim about the U.S. possessing the largest nuclear arsenal, with Russia and the U.S. holding nearly 90% of the world's atomic warheads. The U.S. last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, halting the practice due to the end of the Cold War and signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. However, other nations like India, North Korea, and Pakistan have conducted tests since then. Experts warn that restarting U.S. nuclear testing could trigger a dangerous chain reaction, encouraging other nuclear powers to resume their own testing and accelerating a new arms race. Such a move would likely have political rather than scientific motivations and could destabilize global security. Preparing U.S. testing sites in Nevada, unused for over 30 years, would require substantial time and resources, with each test potentially taking several years to plan and execute.
