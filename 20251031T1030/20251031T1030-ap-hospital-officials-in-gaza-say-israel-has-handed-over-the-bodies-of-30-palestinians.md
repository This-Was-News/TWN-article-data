## Article summary
Hospital officials in Gaza reported that Israel has handed over the bodies of 30 Palestinians. This exchange follows the return of remains of two Israeli hostages by Palestinian militants. The transfer of bodies suggests progress in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, despite ongoing Israeli strikes in Gaza. Previously, Israel had returned the bodies of 195 Palestinians without identification. Health officials in Gaza face challenges in identifying bodies due to a lack of DNA kits. Israel confirmed the returned hostage remains belonged to Sahar Baruch and Amiram Cooper, who were taken on October 7, 2023. Hamas has now returned the remains of 17 hostages, with 11 more expected. Sahar Baruch, 25, was killed during an attempted rescue mission, while Amiram Cooper, 84, was confirmed killed in Gaza. A U.S. official indicated that Hamas fighters had a 24-hour deadline to leave a specific zone or face further Israeli strikes. The current ceasefire aims to de-escalate the deadliest conflict between Israel and Hamas, triggered by the October 2023 Hamas attack. This conflict has resulted in a significant number of casualties on both sides.
