## Article summary
Many young American voters, encompassing Gen Z and millennials, are experiencing significant economic anxiety, feeling that the American dream is increasingly out of reach. They face rising costs, mounting debt, and stagnant wages, which erode their faith in elected officials and the political system. These concerns are leading to a sense of disillusionment, with many feeling they lack a political home. Polling data supports these sentiments, showing low trust in government institutions and skepticism about democracy's effectiveness for younger generations. The pursuit of traditional milestones like homeownership, starting a family, or achieving financial stability feels unattainable due to economic realities. Factors such as the faster rise of housing prices compared to wages, significant student loan and mortgage debt, and declining fertility rates contribute to this outlook. Many young adults report achieving less than their parents by the same age, leading to feelings of betrayal by a system that promised success. Consequently, a significant portion of young voters feel that neither major political party is adequately addressing their affordability concerns. This disillusionment is driving some towards populist leaders who promise to disrupt the status quo, regardless of traditional political labels.
