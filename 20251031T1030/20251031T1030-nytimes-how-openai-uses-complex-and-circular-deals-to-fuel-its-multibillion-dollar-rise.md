## Article summary
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that technological revolutions are driven by financial model innovations as much as by technology itself. OpenAI has employed unusual and circular financial deals to fund its rapid growth and ambitious AI development.  A significant portion of the billions invested by Microsoft was funneled back to the company for computing power. As demand for computing power grew, OpenAI expanded its partnerships to include companies like Oracle and CoreWeave, entering into agreements worth tens of billions of dollars for data center services and stock.  SoftBank has also invested heavily, with plans to help OpenAI build its own data centers.  Oracle is set to spend $300 billion on building data centers for OpenAI, which OpenAI will then pay to use.  The United Arab Emirates, through its firm G42, is also involved in building a large data center complex.  Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion, which could help fund OpenAI's data centers, with Nvidia then reinvesting in OpenAI through chip purchases.  AMD has provided OpenAI with a significant stake in the company, offering potential future capital.  Despite generating billions in revenue from services like ChatGPT, OpenAI currently loses more money than it makes. The success of these complex financial arrangements hinges on AI technology's continued progress and OpenAI's ability to expand its revenue streams. Failure could lead to substantial financial losses for OpenAI and its partners, with smaller companies like CoreWeave facing bankruptcy.
