## Article summary
Ukraine has developed and deployed long-range drones, assembled in secret and launched at night, to strike strategic targets deep within Russia, including oil refineries, fuel depots, and military logistics hubs. This campaign, which intensified over the summer, has targeted energy infrastructure, causing gasoline shortages and forcing rationing in some Russian regions. While Western analysts suggest the impact has been serious but not crippling, the strikes have given Kyiv a strategic advantage and tested Russia's air defenses. The drones, often built from parts in a dispersed network of workshops, have significantly increased their range, with some models now capable of striking targets within a 1,000-kilometer radius. This homegrown capability allows Ukraine independent drone launches, bypassing the need for Western approval for imported long-range weapons. The development and deployment of these drones represent a shift in the conflict's geography, bringing the war directly to Russian territory. The strategic logic behind these attacks is attrition by logistics, aiming to degrade Russia's capacity to sustain large-scale operations. Despite the challenges, with fewer than 30% of drones reaching their targets, meticulous planning and the evolving drone technology are crucial to their success. The Liutyi drone, a symbol of national pride, exemplifies Ukraine's no-frills war production philosophy. These strikes have cut Russia's refining capacity and curbed fuel exports, demonstrating Ukraine's growing long-range strike capability and its determination to fight for its freedom.
