## Article summary
President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to eliminate the filibuster to end the ongoing government shutdown. He believes this action would allow the Republican majority to bypass Democrats and reopen federal agencies. The filibuster is a Senate procedure that requires 60 votes to overcome, effectively giving Democrats leverage against the Republican majority. Trump's suggestion, made via Truth Social, could significantly change Senate operations and congressional dealmaking. He reportedly considered this during his recent trip to Asia, where he questioned why Republicans allowed the shutdown. The shutdown, now in its 30th day, is impacting various sectors, including food aid (SNAP), heating oil subsidies, air travel, and healthcare insurance costs. Democrats are pushing to maintain healthcare subsidies, while Republicans suggest addressing it after the government reopens. The shutdown's duration is a concern, with potential to become the longest in history. The outcome of upcoming off-year elections is seen as a potential catalyst for a deal. Republicans, despite controlling Congress, are defending programs they previously sought to cut, including SNAP and Medicaid, which have faced significant reductions and new work requirements. Democrats accuse Republicans of using food aid as leverage and creating a healthcare crisis.
