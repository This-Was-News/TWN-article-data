## Article summary
Rep. Ro Khanna is urging the British royal family to compensate victims of Jeffrey Epstein, citing the ongoing release of files that detail a close relationship between Epstein and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew. Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal titles and removed from his home due to sexual assault allegations and his association with Epstein. Khanna believes the royal family should take responsibility for the harm caused to working-class girls who were victims. Recent filings revealed prosecutors had evidence of Mountbatten-Windsor's involvement in sexual conduct with an Epstein victim and his knowledge of Ghislaine Maxwell recruiting females for Epstein. Despite this, U.S. authorities have not identified him as a target or found evidence of him committing a crime under U.S. law. Mountbatten-Windsor previously settled a lawsuit with accuser Virginia Giuffre, though he denied guilt. The Department of Justice anticipates releasing at least one million more documents related to Epstein in the coming weeks.
