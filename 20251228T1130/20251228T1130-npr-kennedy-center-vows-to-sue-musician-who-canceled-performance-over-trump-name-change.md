## Article summary
The Kennedy Center plans to sue jazz artist Chuck Redd for $1 million after he canceled his annual Christmas Eve performance. Redd cited the addition of President Trump's name to the building's exterior as the reason for his cancellation. A Kennedy Center spokesperson called Redd's decision selfish and a disservice to the arts, stating that great art transcends politics. Redd, a performer on drums and vibraphone, had hosted the center's Christmas Jazz Jam for many years. Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell criticized Redd's cancellation as a political stunt and vowed consequences for artists boycotting the venue. This action follows a trend of artists withdrawing from the Kennedy Center since Trump's name was added and he became chairman, including the musical Hamilton and appearances by Issa Rae and Rhiannon Giddens. The name change, officially "The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts," was approved by the Board of Trustees. The move has faced opposition from Democratic lawmakers, with Rep. Joyce Beatty filing a lawsuit arguing that renaming the memorial requires an act of Congress. The Kennedy Center maintains it is a bipartisan institution committed to presenting programming that inspires all audiences.
