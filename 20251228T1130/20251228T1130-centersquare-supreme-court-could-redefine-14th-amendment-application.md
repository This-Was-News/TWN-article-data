## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case Trump v. Barbara in 2026, which challenges President Donald Trump's executive order that denies birthright citizenship to children born after February 19, 2025, to parents who are either illegally present or temporary residents in the United States. This case hinges on the interpretation of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" within the 14th Amendment, which currently includes children born in the U.S. to foreign parents. Legal experts suggest the Court's interpretation of this phrase will be the deciding factor. Some argue that "subject to the jurisdiction" means being under the lawmaking authority of the U.S., regardless of legal status, while others contend that parental status and allegiance to the sovereign are necessary conditions for citizenship, drawing parallels to English common law. The distinction is made between those unlawfully present and individuals with diplomatic immunity or those in combat situations. The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in early 2026, though a specific date has not yet been set.
