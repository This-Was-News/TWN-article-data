## Article summary
In fiscal year 2025, Texas reported 259,878 illegal border crossers, excluding gotaways. This figure represents about 10% of the total illegal entries in Texas for 2022 and 2023. Gotaway data, which is not publicly released by CBP, indicates that at least two million gotaways have been reported during the Biden administration. Many of these gotaways have criminal records, including some on terrorist watchlists and Special Interest Aliens (SIAs) who pose a national security risk. In fiscal year 2023 alone, Texas reported nearly 450,000 gotaways, accounting for almost 60% of the total known gotaways at the southwest border that year. The El Paso and Del Rio sectors saw the highest numbers of both apprehensions and gotaways. Texas's Operation Lone Star continues to be active, with officers arresting gotaways, smugglers, and other criminals. These efforts have led to the identification of thousands of foreign nationals with active felony warrants, including SIAs primarily from countries of concern. Despite a decrease in overall illegal entries this year, the threat from criminal elements crossing the border remains significant.
