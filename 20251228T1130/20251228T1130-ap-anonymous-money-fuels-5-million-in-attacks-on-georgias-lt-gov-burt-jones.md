## Article summary
In Georgia's upcoming gubernatorial race, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, endorsed by Donald Trump, is facing a significant attack campaign funded by approximately $5 million from an anonymous group called Georgians for Integrity. These television ads and mailers accuse Jones of using his office for personal enrichment, specifically targeting his alleged involvement in a data center development project. Jones' campaign has vehemently denied these claims, labeling them as false and slanderous, and has threatened legal action against broadcasters. The Georgia Republican Party has filed a complaint with the State Ethics Commission, alleging that Georgians for Integrity is violating campaign finance laws by operating as an independent committee without disclosing its donors. This situation highlights the growing influence of "dark money" in state-level politics, a trend attributed in part to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. Despite the accusations, the origins and funding sources of Georgians for Integrity remain obscure, with the group listing a mailbox as its local address and a media buyer and lawyer with distant addresses on its paperwork. Jones' primary rivals for the Republican nomination, Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, have stated they are not involved in the attacks. The debate over whether the ads are explicitly designed to influence an election, and thus subject to disclosure laws, is ongoing, with the Republican Party arguing that the intent is clear to regular voters.
