## Article summary
Despite initial vows to regulate Big Tech, President Trump has largely granted the industry its wishes since taking office. Tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Nvidia have benefited from relaxed limits on AI chip exports, expedited data center construction, and government approval for cryptocurrency. This alliance, cemented by significant campaign donations and lobbying efforts, has led to soaring stock prices for tech companies and record highs for Bitcoin. However, this pro-tech stance has divided the Republican party, drawing criticism from conservative groups concerned about unchecked industry power and the potential negative impacts on American workers and consumers. Lawmakers and conservative figures argue that Trump's policies enrich tech billionaires at the expense of ordinary citizens and that states should retain the right to regulate AI. Concerns are also mounting regarding the environmental impact of data centers and the potential risks of AI to child safety and mental health. While the White House claims this relationship will ensure American technological dominance, critics worry it prioritizes corporate interests over public well-being and fundamental conservative principles.
