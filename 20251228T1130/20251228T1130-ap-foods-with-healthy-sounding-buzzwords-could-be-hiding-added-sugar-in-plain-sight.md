## Article summary
Many foods marketed with healthy-sounding buzzwords, such as "all-natural granola" or "low-fat yogurt with real fruit," can actually contain significant amounts of hidden added sugar. Companies use clever marketing to distract consumers, and some even substitute traditional sweeteners with alternatives like monk fruit or sugar alcohol, which are not regulated as added sugars by the FDA. This practice has led to foods being sweeter than before, despite efforts to be transparent. Excessive sugar intake is linked to serious health risks including heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. The average American consumes a large amount of added sugar daily, with beverages being a major source, but also found in cereals, sauces, dairy products, and even whole-grain bread. To combat this, consumers should carefully check nutrition labels, which now require separate listing of added sugars. However, the effectiveness of this labeling is debated due to the use of unregulated sugar alternatives. Experts recommend limiting added sugar intake to no more than 10% of daily calories, with some suggesting even less, especially for individuals with diabetes. It is crucial to be mindful of all food choices, as even seemingly healthy items like roasted nuts or plant-based milks can contain surprising amounts of sugar. Taking control by preparing foods at home or requesting modifications at food establishments can help manage sugar intake. While sugar alternatives exist, minimizing overall dependence on sweetness is key to improving health.
