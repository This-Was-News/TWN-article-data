## Article summary
The United States is experiencing significant changes due to a crackdown on immigration, leading to labor shortages in various sectors like construction, healthcare, and agriculture. Industries are struggling to find workers as visa fees increase, refugee admissions plummet, and international student enrollment drops. This restrictive policy echoes the immigration shutdowns of the 1920s, which also led to a decrease in the foreign-born population. The impact is felt nationwide, from urban centers to rural towns like Marshalltown, Iowa, where immigrant communities have revitalized local economies and cultures. The current policies are creating widespread insecurity among immigrants, affecting their ability to work and contribute. Historically, periods of low immigration have had mixed effects on assimilation and economic growth. Employers are exploring alternatives like automation and outsourcing, but many service jobs still require human labor. The aging U.S. population will increasingly rely on immigrant workers for caregiving roles. The "brand of America" as a land of opportunity is being tarnished, potentially impacting future innovation and economic dynamism. The long-term consequences of reduced immigration, especially on an aging demographic, remain a significant concern.
