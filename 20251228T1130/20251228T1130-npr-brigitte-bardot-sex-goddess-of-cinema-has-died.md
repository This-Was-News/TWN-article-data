## Article summary
Brigitte Bardot, the iconic sex symbol of 1950s and 60s cinema, has died at the age of 91. Her animal rights foundation announced her passing on Sunday. Bardot, known for her free sexuality and influence on fashion, modeled, acted, and recorded music. She was married four times and had notable relationships with figures like Serge Gainsbourg. Her distinctive look and persona were emulated globally, making her a legend. However, Bardot's later years were marked by controversy, as she was convicted multiple times in France for inciting racial hatred, particularly for anti-Muslim remarks. Born in Paris in 1934, she studied ballet and modeled before her acting career took off, notably in films like 'And God Created Woman,' directed by her first husband, Roger Vadim. Despite critical reviews of her acting, her popularity soared, coinciding with changing societal attitudes towards sex. Bardot retired from acting in 1973 to focus on animal rights, but her controversial public statements continued. She spent her final years with her husband and numerous pets, a stark contrast to her earlier life in the limelight.
