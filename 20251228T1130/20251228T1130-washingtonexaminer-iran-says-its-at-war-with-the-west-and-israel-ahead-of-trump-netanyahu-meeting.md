## Article summary
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared that Iran is engaged in a comprehensive war with the United States, Israel, and Europe, stating they aim to prevent Iran's self-sufficiency and create multifaceted problems. This assertion follows the recent 12 Day War, which significantly impacted Iran's military and infrastructure, despite which Pezeshkian claims Iran is now stronger. He warned of a decisive response to any future strikes. The president's comments precede a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, where discussions are expected to include potential renewed operations against Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile sites, as well as the Gaza ceasefire.
