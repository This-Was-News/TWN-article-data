## Article summary
A powerful winter storm is unleashing extreme weather across the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast this holiday travel weekend. The National Weather Service (NWS) predicts the system will intensify through Tuesday, bringing heavy snow, whiteout conditions, and treacherous travel to the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes. Over a foot of snow is possible in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, with lake-effect snow expected in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. The storm has already dumped nearly 8 inches of snow on New York City and surrounding areas, causing significant traffic disruptions and over 1,000 flight delays and nearly 1,000 cancellations across the U.S. on Saturday evening. Additionally, dangerous ice accumulation is forecast for parts of the Northeast, with up to a quarter-inch expected in eastern New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Bitterly cold wind chills, as low as -35 degrees, are anticipated in North Dakota and -25 degrees in northern Minnesota. In stark contrast, parts of the South and Tennessee Valley will experience spring-like temperatures, reaching highs in the 70s.
