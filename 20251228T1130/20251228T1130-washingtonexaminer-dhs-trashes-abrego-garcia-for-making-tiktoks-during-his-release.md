## Article summary
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin criticized Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing deportation, for creating TikTok videos while awaiting legal proceedings. McLaughlin reposted a video appearing to show Abrego Garcia lip-syncing to a song, expressing frustration that DHS is under a gag order from a judge while Abrego Garcia is free and creating content. This gag order stems from Abrego Garcia's separate criminal case for human smuggling charges, where a federal judge prohibited prejudicial statements from DHS and the Department of Justice. Although that criminal trial was canceled, a hearing is scheduled to determine if the prosecution was vindictive. Meanwhile, another federal judge has repeatedly allowed Abrego Garcia to remain out of U.S. custody following his release in early December. Abrego Garcia's case is highly publicized due to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation efforts. He was previously deported to El Salvador despite a withholding of removal order, but administrative errors led to his return to the U.S. and subsequent human smuggling charges. After pleading not guilty, he was released and then re-arrested by immigration officials, only to be ordered released again by a judge. The Trump administration is seeking another country for his deportation, with his lawyers suggesting Costa Rica.
