## Article summary
A Nashville-based speaker company, Auratone, known for providing speakers used in iconic albums like Michael Jackson's "Thriller," is planning to move its manufacturing overseas. This decision comes as a direct response to the unpredictable and escalating tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Alex Jacobsen, the company's president and owner, stated that the tariffs have made it difficult to plan and operate the 66-year-old family business. With over 60% of Auratone's clients located internationally, moving production abroad is seen as a strategy to reduce exposure to these tariffs. The company, which generates about $400,000 in annual sales and has two part-time employees, has already experienced financial setbacks due to import duties on necessary parts. Jacobsen expressed frustration with the unilateral implementation of tariffs without congressional or public input, highlighting the uncertainty faced by small businesses. He is hopeful that an upcoming Supreme Court ruling on the legality of these tariffs will bring stability to the business environment. The company plans to begin manufacturing some loudspeakers abroad starting in 2026, marking the first time in its history.
