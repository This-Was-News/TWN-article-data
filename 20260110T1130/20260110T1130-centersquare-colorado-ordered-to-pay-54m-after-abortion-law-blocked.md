## Article summary
A federal court has ordered Colorado to pay $5.4 million in legal fees after a law banning abortion pill reversals was blocked. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit legal advocacy group, represented Bella Health and Wellness, a Denver-area crisis pregnancy center, in the lawsuit against the state. Colorado's law, enacted in 2023, made it unprofessional conduct for healthcare providers to prescribe medications for women seeking to reverse the effects of abortion drugs. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against the law shortly after it was signed and later issued a permanent injunction, citing First Amendment rights. The court found that the state failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in regulating the practice, noting that no injuries had been reported and that several women had successfully given birth after receiving the treatment. This ruling struck down Colorado's ban, which was the first of its kind in the nation. Becket stated that 18 babies were born due to abortion pill reversal treatment provided by Bella Health and Wellness during the litigation. The ruling ensures that clinics like Bella can continue offering this care.
