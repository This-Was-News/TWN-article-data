## Article summary
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced intensified efforts by the Treasury Department and the IRS to combat massive social services fraud in Minnesota, which has reached an estimated $9 billion. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is investigating money service businesses suspected of channeling stolen funds overseas, potentially to groups like al-Shabaab. FinCEN has also implemented a geographic targeting order in the Twin Cities to enhance financial reporting and aid in spotting fraudulent activities. The IRS is auditing financial institutions involved in laundering these funds and is establishing a new task force focused on pandemic-era tax incentive abuse and misuse of nonprofit status by entities linked to the fraud. The Treasury Department is also providing fraud prevention training to Minnesota law enforcement. These actions are part of a broader administration response that has already frozen federal social services funding to Minnesota, California, Colorado, Illinois, and New York. Bessent indicated that similar investigations are likely to expand to other states, emphasizing the deployment of all available tools to hold perpetrators accountable and ensure federal aid reaches its intended recipients.
