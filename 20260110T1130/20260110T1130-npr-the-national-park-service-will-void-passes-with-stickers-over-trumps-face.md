## Article summary
The National Park Service has updated its policy stating that passes may be voided if defaced or altered, specifically mentioning stickers or markings on the front of the card. This comes after a backlash against the 2026 America the Beautiful pass, which features portraits of Presidents George Washington and Trump instead of the usual nature imagery. Visitors have responded by covering Trump's image with stickers, leading to a growing protest movement. Some sticker creators are donating proceeds to conservation nonprofits, arguing the movement aims to keep politics out of national parks. The Interior Department claims no new policy was implemented, but rather a clarification of existing rules regarding altered passes. A conservation group has filed a lawsuit, asserting the pass design violates federal requirements and is part of a pattern of Trump branding government materials. The lawsuit seeks to replace the current design with the contest-winning photo of Glacier National Park and prevent presidents' faces from appearing on future passes. While some defend the design as a tribute to the nation's 250th birthday, many visitors view it as inappropriate self-glorification and a departure from the pass's intended purpose.
