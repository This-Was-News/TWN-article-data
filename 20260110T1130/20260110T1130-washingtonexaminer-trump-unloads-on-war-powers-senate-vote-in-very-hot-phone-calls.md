## Article summary
President Donald Trump has reportedly made "very hot phone calls" to Republican senators following a procedural vote that advanced a war powers resolution aimed at restricting his executive authority in Venezuela. Trump privately "unloaded" on Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Sen. Susan Collins, who was a surprising Republican supporter of the resolution. Collins described Trump's call as a "profanity-laced rant." She was one of five Republicans who sided with Democrats to advance the measure, which restricts further military operations against Venezuela without congressional approval. Trump publicly stated that these senators "should never be elected to office again." Thune acknowledged a "spirited conversation" and Trump's frustration, but suggested the president ultimately wants to maintain a Republican majority. The resolution's passage comes after Trump authorized a military operation that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, citing concerns over drug trafficking and election fraud. The White House justified the move based on national security threats posed by Maduro's regime. Following Maduro's removal, Trump expressed confidence in Venezuela's interim government. Collins, who is up for reelection in 2026 and is considered vulnerable, declined to comment directly on Trump's statement about her electoral prospects.
