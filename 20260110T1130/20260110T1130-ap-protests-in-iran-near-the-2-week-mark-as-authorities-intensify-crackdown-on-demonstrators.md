## Article summary
Protests in Iran are nearing the two-week mark, with authorities intensifying their crackdown on demonstrators. The government has acknowledged the ongoing demonstrations, but the Islamic Republic remains largely cut off from the outside world due to internet and phone line disruptions. Reports indicate a growing death toll, with at least 65 people killed and over 2,300 detained, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite warnings from the United States. Iranian state TV has been broadcasting pro-government demonstrations and martial music, while also reporting on security force casualties and claiming control over the nation. However, these reports are often contradicted by verified online videos showing thousands on the streets and instances of violence. The protests, which began over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, have evolved into direct challenges to the country's theocracy. Irans exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi has called for continued demonstrations, urging protesters to use the old lion-and-sun flag. International outlets like Qatar's Al Jazeera are among the few foreign media able to report live from within Iran.
