## Article summary
California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a 2026-27 budget predicting a $2.9 billion shortfall, significantly lower than the $18 billion deficit projected by the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO). Newsom's budget anticipates higher general fund revenues, exceeding $42 billion, due to an optimistic economic outlook, increased stock market levels, and higher cash receipts. The California Department of Finance attributes this difference to not incorporating a significant stock market downturn risk into their forecast, unlike the LAO. The governor's proposal outlines a $348.9 billion budget, with substantial allocations to health, education, and human services. However, some critics, like the Pacific Research Institute, express skepticism about the revenue projections, particularly those linked to AI, and advocate for greater savings. Concerns were also raised about increased state costs for Medi-Cal and CalFresh due to expected decreases in federal expenditures. While some Republicans view the budget as indicative of wasteful spending, others, like Senator John Laird, find it more aligned with current economic realities and supportive of maintaining existing service levels.
