## Article summary
A new video, purportedly from the perspective of an ICE officer, has emerged showing the final moments of a fatal encounter with Renee Good in Minneapolis. The video, published by Alpha News and shared by the Department of Homeland Security, depicts ICE officer Jonathan Ross approaching Good's vehicle while filming on his cellphone. Exchanges occurred between Good, her wife, and officers before Good reversed her vehicle and Ross opened fire. The incident has sparked protests in Minneapolis and other cities, with critics denouncing immigration enforcement tactics. Vice President JD Vance defended the officer, stating the shooting was in self-defense, a claim Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey dismissed as "garbage." Policing experts have raised questions about the officer's training and decision-making, particularly regarding the use of a cellphone while armed. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has requested the public share any evidence related to the shooting and asserted her office's jurisdiction in the investigation, despite the Trump administration's stance. Good's wife, Becca Good, stated that they had "whistles" while the officers had "guns." The Minneapolis shooting occurred during a large-scale immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities. Separately, a Border Patrol shooting in Portland, Oregon, also led to protests, with DHS claiming the driver attempted to weaponize their vehicle.
