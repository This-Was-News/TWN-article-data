## Article summary
Greenland's party leaders have unequivocally rejected President Donald Trump's repeated proposals for the U.S. to acquire control of the island, asserting that Greenland's future should be determined solely by its own people. Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four other party leaders issued a statement emphasizing their desire to be identified as Greenlanders, not Americans or Danes. Trump reiterated his interest in acquiring Greenland, citing concerns that if the U.S. does not control it, Russia or China might, posing a threat to American proximity. He also suggested that the acquisition could happen either 'the easy way' or 'the hard way,' with the White House reportedly considering various options, including military force. Greenlandic leaders stressed that their nation's future is decided through dialogue with its people and in accordance with international law, free from external pressure or interference. Discussions are ongoing between officials from Denmark, Greenland, and the United States regarding this matter. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has previously warned that an American takeover of Greenland could undermine NATO. Greenland, a vast island with a small population, relies on Denmark for its defense, and the international community's response to a potential forceful U.S. acquisition remains uncertain.
