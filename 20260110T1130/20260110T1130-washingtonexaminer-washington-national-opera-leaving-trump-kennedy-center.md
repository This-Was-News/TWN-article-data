## Article summary
The Washington National Opera is ending its long-standing partnership with the Trump-Kennedy Center due to the center's new business model, which requires productions to be fully funded in advance. This requirement is incompatible with opera operations, leading the WNO to reduce its spring season and relocate performances. While the opera did not cite President Trump's takeover of the institution as the direct reason for leaving, its artistic director had previously suggested it as a possibility due to protests from audience members. The opera company had been home to the Kennedy Center since 1971, but stated the affiliation was never meant to be permanent. A spokesperson for the Trump-Kennedy Center referenced a financially challenging relationship with the opera as the reason for the departure. This move follows a series of other artists and groups who have cut ties with the center after Trump ousted previous leadership and added his name to the center's title. These cancellations include the Cookers and Chuck Redd, who pulled out of scheduled shows and canceled events. The opera's decision was made after disagreements among its board members, with some reportedly resigning over the matter. The opera aims to ensure fiscal prudence and fulfill its obligations for a balanced budget with this transition.
