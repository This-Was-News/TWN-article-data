## Article summary
A new video has emerged showing the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis from the officer's perspective. The 47-second video, posted online by Alpha News and reposted by the Department of Homeland Security, captures the final moments of the encounter, including exchanges between Good, her wife, and ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who fired the shots. The video shows Ross approaching Good's vehicle while filming on his cellphone, with other officers present. Good reverses briefly before turning her steering wheel towards the passenger side as Ross opens fire. The Department of Homeland Security and Vice President JD Vance contend the video supports their claim that the officer acted in self-defense. However, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called this argument "garbage," and policing experts have raised questions about the officer's training, particularly holding a gun and cellphone simultaneously. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty stated that the officer does not have complete legal immunity and her office has jurisdiction, urging the public to submit any related recordings or evidence. The shooting occurred during a large immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities, the biggest ever conducted by Homeland Security, with over 1,500 arrests reported. Separately, a Border Patrol shooting in Portland, Oregon, also led to protests, with DHS defending the officer's actions as self-defense after the driver allegedly attempted to hit them with a vehicle.
