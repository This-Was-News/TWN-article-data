## Article summary
Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's interim leader, has become a pivotal figure in the country's political landscape, particularly in relation to U.S. plans. Initially serving as foreign minister in 2014, Rodríguez adopted a combative diplomatic style, berating foreign envoys and labeling protesters as terrorists. Despite facing sanctions, her assertive tactics aided her rise within the government. Now, under President Trump's administration, she leads Venezuela following the apprehension of Nicolás Maduro. Rodríguez faces the immense task of balancing U.S. demands with stabilizing the economy and consolidating power. Known for both her sharp rhetoric against the West and a pragmatic approach, she has navigated internal purges and geopolitical shifts. Her transformation from an ideological provocateur to a technocrat capable of engaging with the U.S. was evident in her efforts to steer Venezuela away from economic collapse. Trained abroad and holding a unique status as the daughter of a Marxist guerrilla, Rodríguez has a complex background. She was involved in efforts to reset U.S.-Venezuela relations in 2017, coinciding with a donation to Trump's inauguration. She brokered a truce with Venezuela's economic elite and initiated a stealth privatization of natural resources. While previously echoing anti-imperialist rhetoric, she recently expressed openness to restoring diplomatic ties with the U.S. Her efforts to court investors have led to a halt in hyperinflation and economic growth, fueling her political ascent. Rodríguez, who delegated significant economic matters to herself, now faces her most challenging role, navigating U.S. demands and domestic pressures. Despite her tough public persona, she is known to appreciate luxury and fine dining. Her spiritual life includes following the Indian guru Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, also holds a significant position as head of the National Assembly, placing the siblings at the helm of key government branches.
