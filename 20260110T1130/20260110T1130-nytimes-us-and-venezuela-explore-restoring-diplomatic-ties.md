## Article summary
Less than a week after the U.S. captured President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela has announced it is exploring the restoration of diplomatic ties with the United States. Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's interim president, stated that a delegation would visit Washington to check on their embassy, which has been closed for nearly seven years. U.S. diplomats have already visited Caracas to assess the potential resumption of embassy operations. This development represents tentative first steps in a rapidly evolving relationship, marked by apparent contradictions. President Trump claimed to be getting along well with Venezuela's government, despite recent actions. Vice President JD Vance celebrated the empowerment of the U.S. military against drug cartels, groups allegedly linked to the Venezuelan government. Rodríguez announced the diplomatic move while denouncing Maduro's "kidnapping" and a U.S. operation causing deaths. Venezuela aims to address the consequences of this aggression and pursue mutual interests. Meanwhile, President Trump urged energy executives to tap into Venezuela's oil reserves, and the U.S. military intercepted another tanker carrying Venezuelan oil. The U.S. Embassy in Caracas closed in early 2019 after Maduro expelled U.S. diplomats. Reopening the embassy presents practical challenges, including safety and legal considerations, and raises questions about U.S. recognition of Rodríguez as a legitimate head of state, potentially impacting Maduro's legal standing.
