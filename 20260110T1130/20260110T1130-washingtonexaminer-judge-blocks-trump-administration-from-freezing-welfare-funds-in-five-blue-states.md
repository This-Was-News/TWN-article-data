## Article summary
A federal judge in New York has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing billions in welfare funding for child care and social services programs in five blue states. The Department of Health and Human Services had paused approximately $10 billion in funding to California, New York, Minnesota, Illinois, and Colorado, citing alleged widespread fraud. The affected funding comes from the Child Care and Development Fund, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and the Social Services Block Grant. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian issued a temporary restraining order, stating the states met the legal threshold to maintain the status quo for two weeks, allowing more time for legal arguments. HHS claims the funding has been subject to fraud and concerns about its use for noncitizens, leading to new nationwide requirements for child care payments. HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon stated the administration is ensuring federal taxpayer dollars are used legitimately and that states are following the law. California Attorney General Rob Bonta countered that the administration provided no evidence of widespread fraud or misuse of funds in California. The states argued in their motion that these programs are crucial for low-income and vulnerable populations.
