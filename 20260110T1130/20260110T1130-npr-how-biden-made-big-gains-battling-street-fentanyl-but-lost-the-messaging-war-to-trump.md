## Article summary
Despite making historic gains in combating street fentanyl, the Biden administration lost the messaging war to Donald Trump. Research indicates that under Biden, the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. significantly decreased, and overdose deaths fell at an unprecedented rate. The potency of illegal fentanyl being sold in U.S. communities was cut roughly in half. However, during the 2024 presidential campaign, Republicans, led by Trump, successfully framed the fentanyl crisis as a failure of Biden's border security policies, often using exaggerated or false claims. Trump's campaign narrative was simple and powerful, arguing that Biden's team had fumbled border security and failed to slow fentanyl trafficking. While fentanyl smuggling and deaths surged during Trump's first term, and continued to rise in the early years of Biden's presidency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, deaths and smuggling began to fall rapidly in Biden's final two years. Experts are baffled that Biden's team failed to communicate their successes, while Trump effectively used the issue to fuel his domestic and foreign policy agendas. Even Vice President Kamala Harris seemed to echo Trump's framing of fentanyl as a border problem. The Trump administration continued to use fentanyl as a key political narrative, exaggerating risks to justify policies like trade tariffs and tougher immigration. Hunter Biden acknowledged that Trump turned the issue into an art form, effectively reframing it in the public mind in ways that Democrats struggled to counter.
