## Article summary
The appointment of a special envoy to Greenland by President Donald Trump has reignited tensions between the United States and Denmark. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen issued a joint statement asserting that Greenland belongs to its people and that the U.S. will not take it over, emphasizing the importance of territorial integrity and international law. Denmark's foreign minister announced he would summon the U.S. ambassador to his ministry in response to the announcement. Trump had previously expressed interest in U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, citing its strategic importance and mineral resources. The appointment of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as envoy was made without prior warning to Danish officials, who were surprised by the move. The White House stated that the envoy role was created due to Greenland's strategic importance in the Arctic. Greenland's prime minister reiterated that the announcement changes nothing domestically and stressed the need for cooperation based on respect. The Danish Defense Intelligence Service had previously noted the U.S. using economic power and threats of military force. The European Union's executive commission president expressed solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, affirming the fundamental principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty.
