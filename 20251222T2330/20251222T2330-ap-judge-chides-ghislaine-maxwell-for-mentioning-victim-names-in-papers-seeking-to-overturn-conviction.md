## Article summary
A judge has reprimanded Ghislaine Maxwell for including confidential victim names in court documents related to her appeal to overturn her sex trafficking conviction. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer stated that these exhibits, filed by Maxwell without legal counsel, will be sealed to protect victim identities and that all future filings must also be submitted under seal. Maxwell is prohibited from naming victims not publicly identified during her trial. She contends that withheld information and false testimony led to her conviction. The judge has set deadlines for Maxwell to indicate if she will use information from the "Epstein files" and to file an amended petition. This action occurs as the Justice Department begins releasing records related to Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, a process that has been criticized for its slow pace and heavy redactions, particularly concerning victim identities. Senator Chuck Schumer has introduced a resolution to legally compel the Justice Department to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche defended the department's cautious approach to redactions, citing the need to protect survivors, and addressed the temporary removal and subsequent restoration of a photograph that included Donald Trump, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Jeffrey Epstein, stating it was due to concerns about potential victim depiction which proved unfounded.
