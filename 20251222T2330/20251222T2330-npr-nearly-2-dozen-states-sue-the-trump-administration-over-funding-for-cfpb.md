## Article summary
Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its refusal to accept funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The attorneys general argue that this action could jeopardize the agency's ability to protect consumers in their respective states. The CFPB, which is typically funded by the Federal Reserve's earnings to ensure independence, is reportedly being denied funds by Acting Director Russell Vought. The administration claims the Fed lacks sufficient earnings due to operating at a loss, a contention rejected by the suing states. They assert that the administration's narrow interpretation of "combined earnings" is unlawful and risks leaving the CFPB without funding as early as January 2026. New York Attorney General Letitia James, leading the coalition, emphasized that the CFPB's data is crucial for state attorneys general to combat predatory lenders and scammers. The lawsuit highlights concerns that defunding the agency will hinder its ability to process consumer complaints and share vital information with states. This legal challenge comes amidst a broader effort by the Trump administration to reduce the CFPB's operations, with previous attempts to cut staff being blocked by courts. The CFPB, established after the 2008 financial crisis, has historically faced criticism from conservatives who view it as overly aggressive and lacking accountability.
