## Article summary
President Trump has expressed a desire for the U.S. to build and sell tiny, "cute" cars similar to Japan's popular "kei cars." While Trump stated it's illegal to build such vehicles in the U.S., the reality is more complex. Kei cars, defined by strict size and engine limits in Japan, do not meet U.S. safety standards, preventing their import unless they are at least 25 years old and classified as antiques. Automakers could theoretically build tiny cars to U.S. standards, but they haven't due to a lack of consumer demand for small vehicles in America. Enthusiasts of existing antique kei cars praise their fun handling, practicality, and affordability, with some even replacing larger trucks with them. However, these antique vehicles lack modern safety features like airbags and crumple zones, posing risks in collisions. Despite Trump's endorsement and the potential for lower costs, the American preference for larger, more profitable vehicles, exemplified by the past failure of the Smart car, suggests that tiny kei cars may not gain widespread popularity in the U.S. market.
