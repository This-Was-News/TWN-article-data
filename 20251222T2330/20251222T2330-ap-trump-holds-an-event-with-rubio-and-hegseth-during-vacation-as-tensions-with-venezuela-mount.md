## Article summary
President Donald Trump is holding a meeting with national security officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. This gathering coincides with escalating U.S. pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government, including the U.S. Coast Guard's interdiction of oil tankers. Trump announced plans to build two new warships as part of a "Golden Fleet." Russia's Foreign Ministry has begun evacuating diplomats' families from Venezuela, with officials assessing the situation grimly. Venezuela's Foreign Minister stated that Russia supports Venezuela against the U.S. "blockade" of oil tankers, accusing the U.S. of violating international law. The U.S. Coast Guard is pursuing a sanctioned oil tanker, described as part of Venezuela's "shadow fleet" used to evade sanctions. This is the third such tanker pursued, following the seizure of two others. Trump has previously demanded Venezuela return seized assets from U.S. oil companies and declared a blockade against sanctioned tankers. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the tanker targeting aims to signal that Maduro's "illegal activity cannot stand." Meanwhile, the Defense Department continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific alleged to be carrying drugs, which has drawn scrutiny for potential extrajudicial killings.
