## Article summary
More than a dozen staff members from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, are leaving to join Advancing American Freedom (AAF), a group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence. This mass departure follows internal turmoil at Heritage and within the broader conservative movement concerning the promotion of extremist ideas. The controversy escalated after Heritage president Kevin Roberts defended Tucker Carlson's interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Pence welcomed the new hires, stating they bring valuable experience and commitment to conservative principles. AAF raised $13 million in two weeks to fund the salaries of these new employees, significantly expanding its staff and research capabilities. AAF aims to promote traditional conservative ideas like low taxation and limited regulation, especially as the Republican Party and the right-wing movement grapple with defining their future direction. The Heritage Foundation, however, characterized some departing staff as disloyal, suggesting their departure allows for a more focused team. This comes as a task force combating antisemitism recently severed ties with Heritage due to related concerns. Heritage has been influential in conservative policy, notably through its Project 2025 initiative.
