## Article summary
A story planned for '60 Minutes' that focused on deportations to El Salvador's CECOT prison has been pulled from the lineup. Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi stated the story was factually correct and had cleared internal legal and standards reviews. However, CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss decided to hold the story, citing a need for greater effort to obtain the Trump administration's perspective. Alfonsi expressed concern that this decision was political, arguing that the administration's refusal to comment should not be a reason to kill a story. Weiss countered that the story, while powerful, covered ground already reported by other outlets and that '60 Minutes' needed to secure interviews with key figures. This dispute highlights ongoing tensions within CBS News and raises questions about potential shifts in editorial direction. The situation also brings to light President Trump's past criticisms of '60 Minutes' and his history of legal action against the network. Despite these internal conflicts, some journalists at '60 Minutes' have expressed optimism about maintaining journalistic rigor under new ownership.
