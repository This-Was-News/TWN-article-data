## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance stated at the Turning Point USA convention that the conservative movement should welcome all who "love America," refusing to set specific boundaries against bigotry. This stance comes amidst internal Republican debates about excluding figures like podcaster Nick Fuentes, who has espoused antisemitic views. Vance emphasized unity over "purity tests," arguing against de-platforming individuals. The convention highlighted the ongoing struggle within the "Make America Great Again" movement to define its identity and leadership in a post-Trump era. Tensions surfaced over issues like antisemitism, with commentators such as Ben Shapiro denouncing "charlatans" and "conspiracism," while Tucker Carlson dismissed talk of a Republican "civil war." Turning Point leader Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk, has endorsed Vance as a potential presidential successor, leveraging the organization's influential volunteer network. Vance's message of inclusivity, regardless of background, resonated with some attendees, while others noted his comments on the U.S. being a "Christian nation." The convention also featured appearances by rapper Nicki Minaj, who spoke positively about Trump and Vance. The jockeying for influence among conservative leaders underscores the challenges of maintaining coalition unity as the party looks toward a future without Donald Trump's direct candidacy.
