## Article summary
Ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his brother Maher are living a life of luxury in Moscow following their country's seizure by rebels. Glimpses into their lives reveal opulent apartments, expensive dining, and lavish parties, despite their fallen status. The brothers have largely remained out of public view, protected by Russian security services and reportedly ordered not to make public statements. While Bashar's son Hafez briefly posted about their escape on social media, he has since gone silent. Meanwhile, Maher has been seen in Moscow's business district and at a trendy hookah bar. The Assad daughters, Zein and Sham, have also been celebrating their birthdays extravagantly in Dubai and Moscow, with evidence of their wealth seen in gifts from luxury brands and parties on private yachts. Both daughters have special agreements allowing them to stay in the UAE, where Zein has returned to her studies at Sorbonne Abu Dhabi, though her presence caused some student unrest. In contrast to Maher's reported generosity towards former officers, Bashar allegedly abandoned his personal assistant in Moscow without funds or identification after their hasty escape. The assistant, unable to pay his hotel bill, eventually returned to Syria and struggles financially, receiving no support from the Assads.
