## Article summary
President Trump announced a new class of Navy ships to be called "Trump-class battleships," with plans to build two and acquire 25, emphasizing AI capabilities and the need for accelerated production. He also announced a pause on five offshore wind farms off the East Coast, citing unspecified national security risks, which significantly impacts $25 billion worth of projects and threatens thousands of jobs. In foreign policy, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as a special envoy to Greenland, a move that angered Denmark and Greenland officials who asserted their right to self-determination. The administration also continued its pressure campaign on Venezuela, seizing oil tankers and accusing President Maduro of funding criminal activity. Regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, Trump dismissed scrutiny as a deflection tactic. Meanwhile, Canada appointed a former BlackRock executive as its new U.S. ambassador amidst strained bilateral relations. The Agriculture Department shed a fifth of its workforce in the first half of the year, raising concerns about its ability to serve farmers and ensure food safety. Senator Chuck Schumer plans to introduce a resolution to take legal action against the Justice Department over its handling of the Epstein files. In Ukraine, President Zelensky expressed optimism about peace talks, while Russia's Kremlin tempered expectations. A federal court extended a protection order for an individual wrongfully deported to El Salvador, preventing his re-detention by ICE.
