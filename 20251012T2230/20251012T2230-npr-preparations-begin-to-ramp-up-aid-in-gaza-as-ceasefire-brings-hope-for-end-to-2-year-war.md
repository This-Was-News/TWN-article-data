## Article summary
Preparations are underway to increase aid to Gaza following a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, ending a two-year war. The Israeli defense body COGAT expects around 600 trucks of aid per day, with Egypt sending 400 trucks on Sunday. The aid includes medical supplies, tents, blankets, food, and fuel, but must be inspected by Israeli forces. The U.N. has 170,000 metric tons of aid ready to enter Gaza once approved. The fate of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which replaced the U.N. aid operation, is unclear after its distribution sites were dismantled. The ceasefire also includes the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to arrive in Israel to meet with hostage families and speak at the Knesset. Health authorities in Gaza are preparing for the return of prisoners and the bodies of medical personnel. Palestinians are returning to areas vacated by Israeli forces, though many homes are destroyed. The war began with a Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, leading to over 67,000 Palestinian deaths and widespread destruction. The long-term fate of the ceasefire and governance of Gaza remains uncertain.
