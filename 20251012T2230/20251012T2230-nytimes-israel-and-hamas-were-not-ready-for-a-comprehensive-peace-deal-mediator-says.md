## Article summary
Qatar's prime minister revealed that mediators delayed complex issues like Hamas' arsenal to expedite a hostage-prisoner swap. The cease-fire deal postponed discussions on Gaza's governance and Hamas' weapons. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani noted that Hamas is open to discussing a non-threatening relationship with Israel. Hamas has expressed willingness for a long-term truce but opposes disarmament. Internal divisions within Hamas exist regarding its future direction. Prime Minister Netanyahu insists on Hamas' disarmament for a permanent end to the war. Arab mediators suggest partial disarmament if President Trump guarantees no restart of the war. The U.S. plan involves a temporary international stabilization force to oversee demilitarization and Israeli troop withdrawals. The future of Hamas' weapons and Gaza's governance remain unresolved.
