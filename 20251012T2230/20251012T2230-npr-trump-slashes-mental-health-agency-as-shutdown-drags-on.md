## Article summary
The Trump administration has laid off over 100 employees at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of a government-wide reduction in force during the ongoing shutdown. Employees were notified late Friday, with no clear rationale provided. SAMHSA, responsible for the 988 suicide prevention hotline and billions in mental health grants, has seen its staff reduced to nearly half since the start of the administration. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the cuts, blaming the Democrat-led government shutdown. SAMHSA's budget was $7.5 billion in 2024, with most funds going to state programs. The administration has proposed significant budget cuts and plans to fold SAMHSA's duties into a new program. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) experienced staff cuts, though some reversals were reported. The CDC cuts targeted areas like disease surveillance and immunization, raising concerns about public health capacity. The HHS statement indicated more cuts could follow, aligning with the administration's 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda.
