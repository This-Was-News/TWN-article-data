## Article summary
President Donald Trump embarked on a trip to Israel and Egypt to celebrate a U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, urging Middle East allies to seize the opportunity for lasting peace. The agreement, still in its early stages, aims to end the war sparked by the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Trump believes the moment is crucial for reshaping the Middle East and improving relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, supported by his administration's actions against Iranian proxies. The first phase of the deal involves the release of hostages, Palestinian prisoners, increased humanitarian aid, and a partial Israeli troop withdrawal. Trump will meet with hostage families, address the Israeli parliament, and attend a summit in Egypt with over 20 countries. However, the truce is fragile, with unresolved issues like Gaza's postwar governance and Hamas's disarmament. The war has left Gaza in ruins and Israel facing international isolation and allegations of genocide. Despite Hamas's military setbacks, the group remains intact. Trump aims to build on the Abraham Accords, potentially normalizing ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, though challenges remain due to the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
