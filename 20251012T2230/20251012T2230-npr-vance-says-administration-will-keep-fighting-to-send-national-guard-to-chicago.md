## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance stated that the Trump administration will continue to fight to deploy the National Guard in Chicago, despite an appeals court blocking the move. The court ruled that while federalized National Guard members can remain in Illinois, they cannot be deployed yet. Vance argued that the administration has the authority to ensure public safety, particularly in Chicago. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, credited judicial rulings for keeping troops off Chicago streets. The legal battle continues as Chicago prepares to host the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, with over 53,000 runners and 1.7 million spectators expected. Concerns about immigration enforcement during the event were addressed by ICE, which stated it does not conduct operations at public events unless there are exigent circumstances. Enrique Rivera, a running club organizer, expressed concerns about safety during preparations rather than the race itself. Chicago has been a focal point in the Trump administration's national immigration crackdown, with ongoing clashes between protesters and federal agents. Recently, a journalist was detained by law enforcement agents during these clashes.
