## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance warned of deeper cuts to the federal workforce as the government shutdown entered its 12th day, affecting hundreds of thousands of furloughed workers. The Trump administration ensured military pay and some services for low-income Americans, but the shutdown led to the closure of Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo. Vance acknowledged the painful nature of the cuts, blaming Democrats for the stalemate. Labor unions sued to stop the Trump administration's aggressive moves, further escalating tensions. The shutdown began after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix without an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. Trump and Republicans insist on reopening the government first before negotiating health subsidies. Negotiations are stalled, with both parties blaming each other. Progressive activists support Democrats, while Republicans show no signs of backing down. Thousands of federal employees face layoffs, with Democrats calling the firings illegal and unnecessary.
