## Article summary
Stephanie Rogers, a federal employee and microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, has been affected by the ongoing government shutdown. She moved in with her mother and two daughters to cut costs, anticipating financial strain. Rogers recalls being unprepared during the 2018 shutdown and has taken steps to mitigate the impact this time, such as securing medical appointments and medication refills. She has also dipped into her retirement savings, which will have tax consequences. Rogers is uncertain about her job security, health insurance, and back pay, adding to her stress. She has applied for state unemployment and is considering other job opportunities outside the federal government. The shutdown has caused significant financial and emotional strain on her family, with her daughters also expressing concern about her employment.
