## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has been terminating immigration judges, particularly those with backgrounds in immigrant defense, often while they are presiding over hearings. Three such judges, Kyra Lilien, Anam Petit, and Tania Nemer, recounted their experiences of being abruptly fired via email or escorted out of their courtrooms without immediate explanation. This pattern of dismissals has affected numerous judges, with NPR identifying 70 immigration judges who received termination notices between February and October. An analysis revealed that judges with prior immigrant defense experience, and no history at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), constituted a significant portion of these firings. The DOJ states that personnel decisions are based on factors like conduct and performance, not prior experience, though their count of terminated judges differs from NPR's. Fired judges are seeking reasons for their dismissals through legal means, with some suspecting targeted firings based on protected classes. These terminations leave thousands of immigration cases reassigned, potentially delaying proceedings for immigrants for years. The agency is also working to reinstate judges previously dismissed under the Biden administration, while simultaneously hiring new judges, many with federal government and DHS backgrounds, and notably, none appear to have prior experience in immigrant defense. The composition of immigration judges has shifted over time, with a historical push for diversity in backgrounds, a trend that appears to be reversing.
