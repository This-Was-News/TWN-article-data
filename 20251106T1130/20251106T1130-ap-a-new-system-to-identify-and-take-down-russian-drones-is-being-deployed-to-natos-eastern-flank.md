## Article summary
NATO is deploying a new weapons system called Merops to its eastern flank in Poland and Romania to counter Russian drones. This deployment follows several recent incursions into NATO airspace, which highlighted the alliance's vulnerabilities. The Merops system is designed to identify and cost-effectively neutralize drones, which are difficult to detect with traditional radar. It uses artificial intelligence to navigate even when communications are jammed. The system is compact and can be transported in a pickup truck. Denmark will also use Merops as part of a broader effort to bolster defenses along NATO's eastern border. The need for such technology became urgent after Russian drones flew into Polish airspace and later into Romanian airspace, causing disruptions and raising concerns. The Merops system offers accurate detection and targeting of drones at a lower cost than using fighter jets. It addresses the challenge of drones flying at low altitudes, making them difficult for standard radar to track. The system can either directly engage hostile drones or provide targeting information to ground or air forces. Merops aims to deter potential Russian aggression by creating a heavily defended border zone. This initiative is part of a larger, multi-year strategy to build layered defenses along NATO's frontier, leveraging technological capabilities to offset Russia's manpower advantage. The Merops system has been chosen due to its successful use in Ukraine, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world conflict scenarios. This development is part of an ongoing technological arms race, with both NATO and Russia rapidly evolving their drone warfare capabilities.
