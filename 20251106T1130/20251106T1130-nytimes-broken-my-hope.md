## Article summary
President Trump's new policy drastically reduces the number of refugees allowed into the United States to a historic low of 7,500 for the fiscal year, a significant decrease from the previous administration's ceiling of 125,000. This policy has shattered the hopes of many, including Mohammed Faisal, a Rohingya Muslim from Bangladesh who sold all his possessions to resettle in America. The United States has been a dream country for him and his family, who have faced persecution in Myanmar. The new cap, implemented without congressional consultation, prioritizes groups like white South Africans, a decision disputed by the South African government. Refugees from countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Syria, and Myanmar, which have experienced conflict or upheaval, have been significantly impacted. Daw May Hnin fears she may never see her son again, as Myanmar is now subject to a travel ban. Similarly, Afghans who aided U.S. programs face despair, with their temporary protected status withdrawn, potentially leading to deportations. Despite the bleak outlook, some, like Mr. Faisal, find a glimmer of hope in the election of a Muslim American immigrant as mayor of New York City.
