## Article summary
A new analysis by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities suggests that millions of low-income Americans may receive significantly less or no food stamp benefits this month due to the Trump administration's plan to partially fund SNAP during the government shutdown. Households receiving the maximum benefits could see their payments cut by about half, and those with some income may lose a larger share, with some receiving as little as $12. The analysis estimates that up to 1.2 million households could receive $0, and nearly 5 million people may get no benefits at all. The center also found that the USDA will likely spend only $3 billion of its contingency fund, rather than the $4.65 billion ordered by two federal judges to maintain SNAP payments. Implementing the administration's complex partial funding formula presents significant challenges for states, potentially causing delays of weeks or months in benefit distribution. Some states are warning that payments could be significantly delayed, and Pennsylvania has criticized the federal government's approach as unnecessarily complex. A coalition of cities and nonprofits has returned to federal court to compel the Trump administration to comply with an order to restart SNAP aid expeditiously.
