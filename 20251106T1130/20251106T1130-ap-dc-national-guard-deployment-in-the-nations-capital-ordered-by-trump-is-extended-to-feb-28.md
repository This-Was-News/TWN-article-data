## Article summary
The deployment of the Washington D.C. National Guard in the nation's capital has been extended to February 28, according to formal orders. This extension, stemming from an emergency declared by President Donald Trump in August, aims to protect federal property and functions and support law enforcement. Hundreds of National Guard troops have been in Washington since August, with the D.C. Guard being the largest contributor. While initially part of a crime-fighting mission, a significant portion of their duties has involved beautification efforts like clearing trash and pruning trees. The presence of the Guard in the city is currently the subject of a lawsuit filed by the D.C. Attorney General, challenging the administration's use of the National Guard. This lawsuit has led to filings from numerous states, with some supporting the Trump administration and others aligning with Washington. The Trump administration asserts its authority to deploy the D.C. Guard as its commander-in-chief. Court documents suggest the D.C. Guard could remain in the city until next summer, though a judge has yet to rule on the request to have them removed. The duration of deployments for National Guard troops from other states remains uncertain, with many planning to withdraw by the end of November unless their deployments are extended.
