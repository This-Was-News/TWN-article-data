## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will implement a 10% reduction in air traffic at numerous busy airports to ensure safety amid ongoing government shutdown staffing shortages for air traffic controllers. This measure, set to begin on Friday in 40 high-volume markets, aims to alleviate pressure on controllers before safety is compromised. The shutdown, now in its sixth week, has severely impacted controllers who are working without pay, leading to increased absences and some taking on second jobs. Even before the shutdown, the FAA faced a significant shortage of over 3,000 certified controllers. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford stated that early indicators necessitated this action to prevent further deterioration. While specific airports were not named, major hubs like Dallas, Houston, Newark, and Phoenix are experiencing persistent shortages. The decision, made in consultation with airline leaders, is expected to cause flight cancellations and rescheduling, potentially disrupting thousands of flights daily. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the frustration this will cause but emphasized that maintaining safety is the paramount concern. This situation is unprecedented in Bedford's 35-year aviation career, highlighting the unique challenges posed by the prolonged government shutdown.
