## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced it will reduce flights by 10% at some of the busiest U.S. airports starting Friday due to the ongoing government shutdown. FAA administrator Bryan Bedford stated this measure is necessary to ensure air safety amidst staffing shortages caused by air traffic controllers working without pay. This situation is unprecedented in his 35-year aviation career. Experts anticipate hundreds, if not thousands, of flight cancellations as a result. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since October 1st, often with mandatory overtime, impacting their ability to cover expenses. While the FAA has not yet named the specific airports, they plan to meet with airline executives to implement these reductions safely. Major airlines and travel industry groups are urging Congress to end the shutdown, citing unnecessary strain on the system and damage to traveler confidence. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned of potential chaos if controllers miss a second paycheck. Staffing shortages have been increasingly reported at air traffic control facilities, with a significant rise in reported potential staffing limits over recent weekends compared to the period before the shutdown.
