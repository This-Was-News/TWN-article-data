## Article summary
Photos from Gaza show the widespread destruction in the Shijaiya neighborhood of Gaza City, leveled by the Israeli military in an effort to demolish what they describe as Hamas infrastructure. Buildings are reduced to rubble and dust, with only a few structures remaining partially intact. The Israeli military led journalists on a tour of the area, explaining their objective is to create a "terror-free zone" where Hamas cannot re-establish itself. Military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani emphasized that rebuilding is impossible with extensive tunnel networks beneath the area. The destruction in Shijaiya is part of a broader campaign by the Israeli military to flatten neighborhoods in northern Gaza, Rafah, and Khan Younis, as indicated by satellite imagery. During the visit, the area appeared devoid of civilians, populated only by Israeli soldiers. One soldier was seen wearing a T-shirt with the slogan "Hamas Hunting Club, Happy Hunting," reflecting the military's stated mission. The images capture the stark reality of the urban landscape transformed into a war zone, highlighting the scale of demolition undertaken.
