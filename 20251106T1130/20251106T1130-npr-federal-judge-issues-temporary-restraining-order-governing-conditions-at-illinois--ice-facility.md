## Article summary
A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order mandating improved conditions at the Broadview ICE facility following a lawsuit detailing alleged mistreatment of detainees. U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman found witness testimonies credible, describing conditions such as sleeping on dirty floors near open toilets and lack of adequate sanitation. The two-week order requires the facility to provide clean bedding, sufficient hygiene products, daily showers, three meals with water, and prescribed medication. Holding cells must be cleaned twice daily, and detainees must have private communication with attorneys, access to a phone, and be entered into an online locator system. The lawsuit, filed by the MacArthur Justice Center and Roger Baldwin Foundation of ACLU, alleges the facility is a "black hole" where federal officials act with impunity. Despite government lawyers stating the facility isn't equipped for overnight stays, it has been documented holding individuals for multiple days. The judge acknowledged the need for practicality in implementing the order and requested an update on compliance by Friday. Plaintiffs lawyers are also seeking further information, including video footage and detainee lists, with the next hearing scheduled for November 19.
