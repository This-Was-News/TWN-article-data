## Article summary
The Trump administration announced plans to reduce air traffic by 10 percent at 40 major U.S. airports if the government shutdown continues. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated these reductions aim to alleviate pressure on air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay. These cuts, set to begin Friday, could lead to thousands of flight cancellations and disrupt travel for hundreds of thousands of people. While the administration frames this as a safety measure due to controller shortages, Democrats have expressed skepticism and demanded transparency regarding any safety risk assessments. Aviation analysts predict the busiest travel hubs, including those in the New York and Washington D.C. areas, will be most affected. The reductions are expected to impact commercial, cargo, and potentially international flights, with airlines like United Airlines indicating a focus on regional and domestic routes. The FAA administrator Bryan Bedford described the situation as unprecedented due to the ongoing shutdown, emphasizing a proactive approach to prevent safety issues. The move has drawn political criticism, with some labeling it as flirting with disaster, while others highlight the potential economic and societal ripple effects of widespread travel disruptions.
