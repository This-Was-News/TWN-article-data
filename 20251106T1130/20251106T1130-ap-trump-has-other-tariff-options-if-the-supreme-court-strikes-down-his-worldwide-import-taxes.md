## Article summary
President Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. would be left defenseless if the Supreme Court strikes down his tariffs imposed on nearly every country. However, even if the court rules against him, Trump possesses several alternative avenues to continue imposing aggressive import taxes. These options include re-utilizing tariff powers from his first term and accessing others, such as one dating back to the Great Depression. Experts suggest Trump could effectively rebuild his current tariff landscape using these other authorities. While the Supreme Court expressed skepticism regarding his broad claims of authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Congress has delegated tariff powers through several other statutes with specific limitations. Tariffs have become a central element of Trump's foreign policy, with average U.S. tariffs significantly increasing during his presidency. The Constitution grants Congress the power to tax and impose tariffs, yet Trump has acted unilaterally. Among his potential tools is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which he has used extensively against China for trade disputes, allowing for tariffs without size limits, though requiring an investigation. Another option is Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which permits tariffs up to 15% for 150 days in response to unbalanced trade, without a prior investigation. Trump has also utilized Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on imports deemed a threat to national security, such as steel, aluminum, and even furniture, with courts generally deferring to presidential national security determinations. Finally, Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, known as Smoot-Hawley, allows for tariffs up to 50% on imports from countries discriminating against U.S. businesses, with no investigation or time limit, though it has never been imposed and carries a negative historical reputation.
