## Article summary
A policy shift within the Trump administration has led to the U.S. military conducting lethal strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, a departure from decades of maritime interdiction. This new approach, which has resulted in approximately 20 strikes and over 75 deaths since September, has drawn criticism from current and former U.S. officials who question its legality and effectiveness. These officials express concern that sinking boats, rather than interdicting them, seizing drugs, and prosecuting crews, eliminates crucial intelligence-gathering opportunities. The shift away from traditional interdictions, which allowed for the development of human intelligence and dismantling of cartel networks, is seen by some as a "macho" but ultimately counterproductive strategy. Even a high-ranking Justice Department official suggested sinking boats as early as February, months before the strikes began, indicating a potential early consideration of this aggressive policy. The administration maintains that these actions are necessary to combat drug trafficking and pose a direct threat to the U.S., though public evidence supporting these claims has not been provided. A Justice Department memo reportedly justifies the strikes under the laws of war, asserting a non-international armed conflict with cartels. However, critics argue that this method of killing individuals at sea without due process or evidence of violence is unlawful and detrimental to long-term drug interdiction efforts. The closure of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) and the transfer of its cases further signal a significant restructuring of U.S. drug policy.
