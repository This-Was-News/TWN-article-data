## Article summary
The Trump administration has intensified its pressure campaign against Venezuela, deploying an aircraft carrier to the Caribbean and designating a Venezuelan group as a foreign terrorist organization. President Trump also indicated a possibility of negotiations with President Nicolás Maduro, stating that the U.S. may be having discussions with him. The administration has conducted numerous strikes on boats it claims are trafficking narcotics, though evidence for these claims is often not provided. The U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, the largest U.S. aircraft carrier, has arrived in the Caribbean, increasing the U.S. military's presence in the region to 15,000 soldiers and sailors. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the designation of Cartel de Los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, a group allegedly headed by Maduro and high-ranking officials. This designation restricts financial transactions for the group and its associates. The U.S. and its allies do not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader following last year's election. The military also reported striking a boat in the eastern Pacific, claiming it was operated by a designated terrorist organization and trafficking narcotics, resulting in three deaths. Legal experts have raised concerns about the legality of the U.S. campaign against drug trafficking boats. The overall objective of the U.S. pressure campaign appears to be the removal of Maduro from office.
