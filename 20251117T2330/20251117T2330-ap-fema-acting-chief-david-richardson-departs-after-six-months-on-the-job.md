## Article summary
David Richardson, the acting chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), has departed his position after only six months. This marks another significant disruption within the agency, which has experienced numerous staff departures, program cuts, and policy changes over the past year. Richardson's tenure was notably brief and largely out of the public eye, but he faced criticism for his response to the deadly Texas floods earlier in the year. He replaced the previous acting head, Cameron Hamilton, in May. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson expressed appreciation for Richardson's service as he returns to the private sector. Richardson, a former Marine Corps officer with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, lacked prior emergency management experience when he took on the role. His leadership was questioned by both members of Congress and FEMA employees, particularly after his delayed arrival at the scene of the Texas floods. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem maintained strict control over FEMA programs and spending, requiring her personal approval for expenditures over $100,000. FEMA Chief of Staff Karen Evans is set to assume the acting administrator role on December 1st. The agency has been undergoing significant changes since President Trump's administration, with a substantial percentage of permanent employees having departed. The Trump administration has also reduced mitigation funding and imposed new requirements on preparedness grants.
