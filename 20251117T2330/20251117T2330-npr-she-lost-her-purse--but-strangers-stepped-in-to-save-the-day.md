## Article summary
While visiting Chicago, Lavonne Schaafsma lost her purse, which contained her ID, credit cards, medications, and cash, causing her significant anxiety. She retraced her steps and eventually went into a gift shop, hoping her purse had been turned in. The cashier informed her that two women had indeed brought it in, after witnessing a man attempting to rifle through it. These women, suspecting foul play, intervened by pretending the purse was theirs and taking it from the man. They then brought the purse to the gift shop and left it with a security guard, hoping the owner would return. Shortly after, Schaafsma arrived and was reunited with her belongings. She expressed immense gratitude to these strangers for their courage and quick thinking, which saved her considerable trouble and distress. Schaafsma reflects on the event, often wondering if she would have acted similarly and encourages others to perform acts of kindness for strangers.
