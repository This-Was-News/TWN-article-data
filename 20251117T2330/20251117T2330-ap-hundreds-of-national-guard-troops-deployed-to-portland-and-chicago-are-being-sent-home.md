## Article summary
Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, are being sent home due to ongoing court battles over their domestic mission under the Trump administration. This withdrawal is part of a broader shift in troop deployments following President Trump's immigration crackdown in cities with Democratic leadership. U.S. Northern Command stated that while units are being shifted, there will be a continued long-term presence in Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Specifically, all 200 California National Guard troops in Portland will return, and the Oregon National Guard presence will be reduced. In Chicago, approximately 200 Texas National Guard troops are being sent home, with others on standby. About 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in the Chicago area but are not legally permitted to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security. State officials, including the governors of California and Oregon, have criticized the deployments, with California's governor calling them illegal and Oregon's governor urging the demobilization of remaining troops. Illinois's governor expressed concerns about the administration's lack of communication and threats to federalize more troops. Democratic cities like Chicago have legally challenged the deployments, arguing they violate states' sovereignty. A federal judge in Portland issued a permanent injunction blocking troop deployment there, though the administration is appealing. The National Guard deployments have been controversial, showcasing an expanded use of the military for domestic goals, primarily to protect federal facilities like those run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
