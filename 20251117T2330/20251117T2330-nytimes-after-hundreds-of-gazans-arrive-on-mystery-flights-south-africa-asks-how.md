## Article summary
Hundreds of Palestinians have arrived in South Africa on flights under suspicious circumstances, prompting an investigation by the South African government. One refugee, Dr. Ahmed Shehada, described paying $1,600 per person to a crypto account arranged by a group called Al-Majd Europe to escape Gaza. Despite initial skepticism, he took the chance due to the dire situation in Gaza, embarking on a 24-hour journey through tense checkpoints before flying to South Africa. South Africa's foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, suggested Israel might be behind these flights as part of an agenda to remove Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank, an accusation Israel denies. President Cyril Ramaphosa stated that South Africa has a duty to accept these Palestinians, viewing them as a special case due to the country's history of support. The circumstances surrounding the flights and the organization arranging them remain unclear, with South African officials having little information about Al-Majd Europe.
