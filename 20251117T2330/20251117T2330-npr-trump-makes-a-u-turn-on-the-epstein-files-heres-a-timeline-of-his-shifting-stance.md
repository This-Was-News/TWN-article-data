## Article summary
President Trump has made a significant shift in his stance regarding the release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Initially, Trump resisted calls for transparency, dismissing the controversy as a "Democrat hoax." However, after months of mounting pressure from both Republicans and Democrats, including prominent figures and media personalities, Trump publicly urged House Republicans to vote to release the files. This about-face comes amid ongoing public skepticism about Epstein's death and allegations of a powerful network facilitating his crimes. The timeline details various instances where Trump downplayed his relationship with Epstein, supported Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the files, and criticized fellow Republicans for focusing on the issue. The Justice Department has also been involved, releasing memos, filing motions to unseal documents, and responding to congressional subpoenas. Despite previous denials, a note in Epstein's birthday book appearing to bear Trump's signature has surfaced, further fueling the controversy. Trump's recent call for a vote on releasing the files suggests a desire to move past the issue, stating, "we have nothing to hide."
