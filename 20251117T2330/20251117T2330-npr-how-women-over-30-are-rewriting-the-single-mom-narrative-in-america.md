## Article summary
The narrative surrounding single mothers in America is evolving, with a significant rise in women over 30 choosing to become single parents. Currently, 40% of babies in the U.S. are born to unmarried mothers, a stark contrast to 1960. These women are often more established, possessing greater life experience, higher education, and more stable employment than previous generations of single mothers, who were typically teenagers or in their early twenties. Factors contributing to this shift include increased female workforce participation and educational attainment, which empower women to financially support themselves and their children independently. For some, advanced reproductive technologies like IVF offer another path to motherhood, though it can be a costly and emotionally taxing process. While research suggests children benefit from two-parent households due to increased resources, studies also indicate that children of older single mothers tend to achieve higher educational and income levels as adults. Despite facing structural disadvantages, such as laws favoring married couples, today's single mothers are forging their own paths. They are building supportive communities, prioritizing their children's well-being, and finding agency in their decisions, redefining what it means to be a single parent in contemporary America.
