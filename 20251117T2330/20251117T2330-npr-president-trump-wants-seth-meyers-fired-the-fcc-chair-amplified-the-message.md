## Article summary
President Trump has publicly called for NBC's late-night host Seth Meyers to be fired, citing "Trump Derangement Syndrome" and low ratings for Meyers' show. Trump posted his demand on Truth Social, criticizing Meyers' talent and performance. Shortly after Trump's post, Brendan Carr, chairperson of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), reposted Trump's message on X. This action drew criticism from media watchdogs and free speech advocates, who viewed it as governmental pressure on media content and a potential overreach of the FCC's authority. The FCC's powers to restrict broadcast content are limited by the First Amendment. Critics argued that the government should not pressure companies regarding commentary or jokes from hosts, regardless of their political leaning. The FCC also oversees major media mergers, and some observers have noted the timing of Trump's calls for firings and subsequent corporate decisions. For instance, after Trump targeted Stephen Colbert, CBS announced *The Late Show with Colbert* would end in May 2026, though CBS stated the decision was financial. NBCUniversal, which owns Meyers' show, is owned by Comcast, a company expected to bid on Warner Bros. Discovery, a sale that may face scrutiny from a potential Trump administration.
