## Article summary
The United Nations Security Council has adopted President Trumps peace plan for Gaza, providing a U.N. mandate for rebuilding the war-ravaged enclave after two years of conflict. The resolution passed with 13 votes in favor, while Russia and China abstained. This marks a significant diplomatic victory for the Trump administration, which had previously been isolated due to its strong support for Israel. The plan calls for an International Stabilization Force to demilitarize and govern Gaza, overseen by a Board of Peace. While many Arab and Muslim nations supported the resolution, concerns remain regarding the lack of clear language on Palestinian statehood. The resolution suggests that reforms in the Palestinian Authority and progress in Gaza's redevelopment could lead to a pathway for Palestinian self-determination. However, challenges persist, including ongoing Israeli strikes, violence in the West Bank, and the presence of armed Hamas fighters. Arab and Muslim countries contributing troops are wary of direct clashes and public backlash. The resolution allows for the World Bank to allocate funds for reconstruction and establishes a trust fund for this purpose. The stabilization force will coordinate with Egypt and Israel to train Palestinian police, protect civilians, and secure humanitarian corridors. The Board of Peace is authorized to oversee Gaza until at least the end of 2027, with day-to-day management by a Palestinian committee.
