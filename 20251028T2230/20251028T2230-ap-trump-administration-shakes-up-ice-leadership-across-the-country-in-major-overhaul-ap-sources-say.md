## Article summary
The Trump administration is enacting a significant overhaul of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership across the nation, with at least half of the top officials in ICE field offices being reassigned. This shake-up involves replacing some leaders with existing or retired Customs and Border Protection (CBP) staff, while others will be replaced by ICE officers. The changes, initiated by the Homeland Security Department, impact major cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington. This move signifies a deeper integration of Border Patrol agents into ICE operations at a time when CBP has faced accusations of aggressive tactics. The reassignments represent a substantial turnover in leadership responsible for executing the administration's hardline immigration enforcement policies. While the specific reasons for the personnel changes were not immediately clear, they reflect the ongoing importance of ICE in fulfilling the president's vision for mass deportations. This is the third significant leadership change at ICE since President Trump took office, underscoring the agency's pivotal role. Homeland Security and the White House have emphasized that all immigration enforcement elements are working cohesively as one team to achieve the administration's goals.
