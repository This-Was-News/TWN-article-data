## Article summary
A federal judge in Chicago has admonished Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official, for his agency's use of force and tear gas during immigration enforcement operations. Judge Sara L. Ellis ordered Bovino to personally provide her with a daily report on his team's actions, citing instances where agents appeared to violate a previous restraining order. The judge expressed particular concern over the use of tear gas in residential neighborhoods, including near a children's Halloween parade, and questioned Bovino about his own deployment of tear gas. Bovino, who has publicly defended the immigration crackdown, stated that his agents would abide by the court's order. The judge also mandated that all agents be equipped with body-worn cameras and that footage be provided to the court. The lawsuit that led to the restraining order was filed by a coalition accusing federal agents of excessive brutality. The government claims the use of force was necessary in response to volatile situations and agitators, while plaintiffs allege agents incite violence to justify their actions. Judge Ellis emphasized the need for clear warnings before deploying chemical agents and allowing time for compliance. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between immigration enforcement tactics and community concerns in Chicago.
