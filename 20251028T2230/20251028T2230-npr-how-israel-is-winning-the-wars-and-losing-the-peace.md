## Article summary
Israel has achieved significant military victories in recent years, defeating enemies like Hamas and the Iran terror axis. However, these battlefield successes have not translated into political wins, leading to increased international isolation. The Gaza war, which began with a Hamas attack and Israel's subsequent response, has drawn widespread criticism and legal challenges, including genocide charges at the International Court of Justice and war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court. While Israel's military situation appears strong, its foreign policy standing has severely deteriorated, potentially impacting its relationship with the United States, a critical ally. Support for Israel in the U.S. is reportedly declining, even among Republicans. Former President Trump, while a supporter, has set boundaries, urging Israel to adhere to ceasefires and not annex the West Bank. The recent Gaza conflict has also re-energized younger generations in the Arab world regarding the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Despite strains, the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations, have largely endured, with business ties gradually resuming. Moving forward, the region requires political leadership to break the cycle of conflict and foster new initiatives. The future of Gaza, including the stability of a ceasefire and the commencement of rebuilding efforts, will significantly influence Israel's international standing.
