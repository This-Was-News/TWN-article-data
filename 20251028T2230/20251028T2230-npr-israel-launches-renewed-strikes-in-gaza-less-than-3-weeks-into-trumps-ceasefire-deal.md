## Article summary
The Israeli military launched renewed strikes in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, less than three weeks after a ceasefire deal brokered by President Trump. Gaza's civil defense reported at least nine people killed or injured in Gaza City and Khan Younis. These attacks occurred as Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the ceasefire, which began on October 10. Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered the strikes after accusing Hamas of attempting to stage the return of partial remains of a hostage, which he called a violation of the U.S.-negotiated ceasefire. The Israeli military released drone footage allegedly showing Hamas operatives burying remains. Hamas denied the allegations, calling them baseless and a fabrication to justify aggression. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated Hamas would pay a heavy price for attacking Israeli troops and failing to return deceased hostages. This follows earlier Israeli airstrikes on October 19 after two soldiers were killed in Rafah, which Hamas said it had no connection to. Despite the violence, U.S. Vice President Vance expressed confidence that the ceasefire would hold, acknowledging that minor skirmishes might occur.
