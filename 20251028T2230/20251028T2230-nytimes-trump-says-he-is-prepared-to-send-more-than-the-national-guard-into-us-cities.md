## Article summary
President Trump announced to American troops in Japan that he is prepared to deploy more than the National Guard into U.S. cities if deemed necessary to enforce crackdowns on crime and immigration. Speaking aboard an aircraft carrier, Trump delivered a partisan speech, emphasizing his commitment to ensuring "safe cities" and defending recent U.S. military strikes against suspected drug smugglers. These strikes, which have drawn criticism for potentially harming civilians, were defended by Trump as a necessary war against drug cartels. He asserted that the U.S. is winning this war at sea and will now focus on stopping drugs coming in by land. The speech also touched upon military-economic relations with Japan, including a missile order and Toyota's investment in the U.S. Trump aimed to connect with the troops, praising their dedication and promising salary increases, while also referencing a government shutdown that impacted troop pay. He also made lighthearted remarks about the appearance of the service members and his desire to be an admiral.
