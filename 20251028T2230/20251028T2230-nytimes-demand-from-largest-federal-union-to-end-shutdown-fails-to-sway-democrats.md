## Article summary
Senate Democrats have refused to yield in the ongoing government shutdown dispute, even after the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers union, called for an end to the impasse. Republicans attempted to use the union's plea to pressure Democrats into accepting a temporary spending bill, but their efforts were unsuccessful. The union, representing hundreds of thousands of federal employees impacted by the shutdown, urged an end to the "gamesmanship" and passage of a "clean continuing resolution." Despite this public shift from the union, Democrats maintained their stance, arguing that a clean extension without addressing healthcare subsidies was unacceptable. Senator Chuck Schumer stated that both federal workers' pay and healthcare concerns could be resolved simultaneously. Democrats had previously blocked a Republican bill to pay federal workers, citing concerns about presidential discretion, while Republicans had voted against Democratic proposals to pay some workers. Senators expressed sympathy for affected employees but reiterated that a funding bill without healthcare provisions was a "nonstarter." Republicans, however, viewed the union's statement as a sign that Democrats were on the "wrong side" of the issue, highlighting the clear contrast in their approaches.
