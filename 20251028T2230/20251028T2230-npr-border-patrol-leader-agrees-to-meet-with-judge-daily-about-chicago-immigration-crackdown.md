## Article summary
U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino has agreed to daily meetings with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis for the next seven days to discuss the federal agents' aggressive deportation campaign. Judge Ellis expressed concerns about the use of tear gas, particularly near children, and warned that its continued deployment would require strong justification. The judge also noted that Bovino lacks a body-worn camera and the training to use one, despite most agents having this technology, and ordered him to obtain one by Friday. Ellis is presiding over a lawsuit brought by media organizations concerning the treatment of protesters during immigration enforcement operations. She has demanded all use-of-force reports and bodycam footage related to "Operation Midway Blitz" and a list of individuals arrested for non-immigration-related offenses. Bovino testified that he instructed agents to wear visible identification and clarified the protocol for issuing warnings before using riot control weapons. The judge emphasized her role is to ensure agents enforce laws lawfully, not to impede enforcement itself. The Department of Homeland Security stated they refuse to back down from their mission to make America safe, while Mayor Brandon Johnson called Bovino "barbaric" and hoped for accountability from the judge.
