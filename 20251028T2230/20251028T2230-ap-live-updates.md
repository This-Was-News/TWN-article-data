## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa, a catastrophic Category 5 storm tied for the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, has made landfall in Jamaica with 185-mph winds. The storm has caused widespread flooding, ripped roofs off buildings, and triggered landslides across the island. At least seven deaths have been reported in the Caribbean so far, with three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness stated that no infrastructure in the region can withstand a Category 5 storm, emphasizing the challenge of recovery. Extensive damage has been reported in southwestern Jamaica, with entire parishes experiencing blocked roads, fallen trees, and power outages. Four main hospitals have been damaged, with one forced to evacuate 75 patients due to power loss. Floodwaters have trapped families, and rescue efforts have been hampered by dangerous weather conditions. The storm is expected to move across Jamaica and then head towards Cuba, where officials are evacuating over 600,000 people. Climate scientists attribute the storm's rapid intensification to warming ocean temperatures caused by climate change. Humanitarian aid is being prepared by UN agencies and nonprofits for Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti.
