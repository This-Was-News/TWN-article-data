## Article summary
The U.S. military conducted strikes on four alleged drug-running boats in the eastern Pacific, resulting in 14 deaths and one survivor. This marks the deadliest single day in the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking in South American waters. The escalating attacks have strained relations with regional allies, including Mexico and Colombia. Mexico's navy is searching for the sole survivor, and President Claudia Sheinbaum has expressed disagreement with the U.S. actions, emphasizing the need to respect international treaties. The U.S. has also imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro and his government over alleged drug trade involvement. The Pentagon has released footage of the strikes, showing the boats exploding. The total death toll from 13 disclosed strikes has reached at least 57 people. The U.S. military buildup in the region has led Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to accuse the U.S. of fabricating a war against him. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has drawn parallels between these counterdrug operations and the war on terrorism, stating that cartels will be treated similarly to terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda. President Trump has asserted legal authority for these strikes, viewing them as part of an armed conflict with drug cartels.
