## Article summary
President Donald Trump has expressed a desire for a potential third term in the White House, a notion that House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated has "no path." Johnson explained that the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution prohibits a third presidential term, and amending it would be a lengthy and complex process. Despite this constitutional barrier, Trump has repeatedly hinted at seeking to remain in power, with "Trump 2028" merchandise even being distributed. Trump told reporters he would "love to do it" but dismissed the idea of a strategy where he would run as vice president and then assume the presidency, calling it "too cute" and not "right." The speaker characterized these discussions as Trump "trolling the Democrats" and dismissed concerns about a third term as exaggerated. Johnson affirmed his commitment to delivering for the American people and anticipates "four strong years." Trump's actions and words have been seen as testing the boundaries of presidential power. He has been involved in actions such as sending National Guard troops to cities against governors' objections and accepting private donations to fund military pay during a government shutdown.
