## Article summary
A federal judge in San Francisco has indefinitely halted the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal employees that are tied to the ongoing government shutdown. This decision came after the judge had previously issued a temporary pause on thousands of these layoffs, known as RIFs, or reductions-in-force. The Trump administration argued that the executive branch has the authority to conduct RIFs during a lapse in appropriations to achieve policy priorities and cut costs. However, the employees' attorney countered that a lapse in appropriations does not eliminate statutory authority and that the government cannot disregard Congressional mandates. The administration initially tried to limit the scope of the temporary order, but the judge later broadened it to cover more unions. The judge acknowledged the human toll of these actions, reading declarations from employees who described the layoffs as traumatizing, even compared to combat deployment. One employee shared her experience of receiving layoff notices multiple times, causing severe physical and mental distress. The court also heard that a key administration official had expressed a desire for government bureaucrats to be "traumatically affected" by these actions. These shutdown-related layoffs are part of a larger effort by the administration to reduce the federal workforce, with significant numbers of federal employees facing involuntary separation or accepting buyout offers due to fear of termination.
