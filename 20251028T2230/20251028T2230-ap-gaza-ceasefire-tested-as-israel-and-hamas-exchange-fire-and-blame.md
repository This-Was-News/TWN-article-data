## Article summary
A fragile Gaza ceasefire faced a significant test as Israel launched strikes and Hamas responded by delaying the handover of a hostage's body, escalating tensions just two weeks into the truce. At least seven Palestinians were killed in the exchange, prompting international mediators to work towards de-escalation. The Israeli military stated its strikes followed an incident where its forces were fired upon in southern Gaza, and after Hamas provided body parts that Israel identified as partial remains of a hostage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared this a violation of the ceasefire agreement. Hamas denied involvement in the Rafah gunfire and accused Israel of violating the truce with its strikes. U.S. Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence the ceasefire would hold despite expected skirmishes. The slow return of hostage bodies poses a challenge to the ceasefire's next stages, which include Hamas disarmament and future governance of Gaza. Hamas claims difficulty locating bodies amid destruction, while Israel accuses them of deliberate delay. Egypt has deployed resources to aid in the search for remains. An Arab official involved in negotiations described the situation as a violation by both sides but not a significant breach. The remains returned to Israel were identified as Ofir Tzarfati, kidnapped on October 7, 2023. Israel released a video it claims shows Hamas staging the recovery of Tzarfati's remains, an accusation Hamas denies while blaming Israel for obstructing their search efforts.
