## Article summary
The "sticker price" of college tuition has dramatically increased over the past 30 years, with average tuition for both public and private four-year institutions essentially doubling after adjusting for inflation. While many families do not pay the full sticker price due to financial aid and merit aid, the net price has still risen, though it has flattened or even declined in recent years for some. Several factors contribute to the rising sticker price, including declining state funding for public institutions, administrative bloat, the increasing availability of student loans, and competition among universities to build new facilities and hire more staff. The opaque nature of college costs also makes it difficult for families to compare prices and for colleges to compete on cost. Some solutions being explored include standardizing financial aid offer letters and tuition freezes, with Purdue University serving as an example of a successful tuition freeze implemented by focusing on increasing enrollment and other revenue streams while controlling costs. The document also highlights that tuition costs vary widely, with community colleges offering an affordable alternative and federal grants potentially covering tuition for low-income students.
