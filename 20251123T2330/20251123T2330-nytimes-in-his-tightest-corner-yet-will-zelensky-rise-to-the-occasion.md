## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is facing a critical juncture in his wartime leadership. The Trump administration has presented him with a 28-point peace plan, which many view as favoring Russia and betraying Ukraine's interests. Zelensky has been given a week to accept the plan or risk losing U.S. support. This pressure comes amid battlefield losses and a significant domestic corruption scandal that has threatened to destabilize his government. Despite these challenges, analysts suggest Zelensky has a history of skillfully navigating difficult situations. The U.S. peace proposal, while daunting, has inadvertently unified Ukrainians and shifted focus away from the corruption scandal, allowing Zelensky to rally public support. He must now decide how to respond to a settlement that could halt the fighting but potentially jeopardize Ukraine's long-term security. His ability to find a path forward will depend on strong backing from European allies and the Ukrainian populace.
