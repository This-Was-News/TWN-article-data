## Article summary
Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has told a judge that he violated his ankle monitoring due to a nervous breakdown and hallucinations caused by a change in his medication. He claimed he believed the device was being tapped, leading him to try and uncover it. Bolsonaro also stated he had not been sleeping well and was experiencing paranoia, which fueled his curiosity about the ankle monitor. The Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Bolsonaro's preemptive jailing, considering him a flight risk. Bolsonaro was previously sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup to remain in power after his 2022 electoral defeat. His lawyers argued for his release due to poor health, but these requests have been previously rejected. The court has authorized visits from his family. President Lula commented on the jailing, stating the court's decision is final and everyone knows what he did. Protests occurred outside the police headquarters, with supporters and detractors of Bolsonaro expressing their views.
