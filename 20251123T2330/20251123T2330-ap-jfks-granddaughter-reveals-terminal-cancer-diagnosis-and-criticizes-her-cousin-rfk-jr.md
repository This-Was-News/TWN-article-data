## Article summary
Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of John F. Kennedy, has revealed she has terminal cancer, with a prognosis of about one year to live. Diagnosed in May 2024 at age 34 with acute myeloid leukemia, she has undergone chemotherapy and stem cell transplants. Schlossberg, an environmental journalist, expressed her fears about her children not remembering her and the sadness of not continuing her life with her husband. She also criticized her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for policies she believes could harm cancer patients, citing his role in cutting funding for mRNA vaccine research, which she sees as a potential tool against certain cancers. Schlossberg's essay was published on the anniversary of her grandfather's assassination. Her mother, Caroline Kennedy, has urged senators to reject RFK Jr.'s confirmation as Health and Human Services Secretary. Schlossberg shared her struggles with treatment and the emotional toll on her family, particularly her mother, whom she has always tried to protect.
