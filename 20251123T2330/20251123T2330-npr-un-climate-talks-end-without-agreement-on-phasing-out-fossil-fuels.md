## Article summary
The U.N. global climate conference, COP30, concluded in Brazil without a formal agreement on phasing out fossil fuels, the primary driver of global warming. Despite over 80 countries calling for a clear roadmap to transition away from coal, oil, and natural gas, major fossil-fuel producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed such measures. The United States did not participate in the negotiations. The final agreement only mentioned the "need for urgent action" to cut greenhouse gas emissions, omitting any specific reference to fossil fuels. However, two dozen countries announced they would form a new process focused on transitioning away from fossil fuels, with Colombia and the Netherlands set to host the first international conference on the issue in April. This COP30 also occurred as a crucial temperature target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is projected to be exceeded in the next decade, with current global emission reduction plans falling far short of what scientists deem necessary. Progress on funding climate action for developing nations also saw little advancement, with wealthy countries historically being unreliable funders. China, absent from the U.S. delegation, highlighted trade issues related to green technology manufacturing. The emergence of a dedicated conference for phasing out fossil fuels signals a growing frustration with the pace of U.N. climate negotiations.
