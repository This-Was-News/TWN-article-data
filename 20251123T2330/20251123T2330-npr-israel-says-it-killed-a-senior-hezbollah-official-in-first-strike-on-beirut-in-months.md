## Article summary
Israel conducted an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs, marking the first such attack on the capital since June. The strike, which killed five people and injured 25, targeted and killed Haytham Tabtabai, identified by Israel as Hezbollah's chief of staff and a leader of its Radwan Unit. Israel stated that Tabtabai was responsible for rebuilding Hezbollah's readiness for war and that the strike was in response to repeated Hezbollah violations of a ceasefire. Hezbollah has not yet officially commented, but a deputy chairman of its political council suggested the strike could lead to an escalation of attacks. This incident occurs shortly before a planned visit to Lebanon by Pope Leo XIV and amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military asserted its commitment to the agreed-upon "understandings" with Lebanon, while Lebanon's President condemned the strike and called for international intervention. The article also notes that Tabtabai was designated a terrorist by the U.S. in 2016 and was seen as the successor to other senior Hezbollah leaders killed in earlier Israeli attacks. The recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began in October 2023, following Hamas's attack on southern Israel, and resulted in significant casualties and destruction.
