## Article summary
Top U.S. and Ukrainian officials have reported progress in Geneva talks aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war, though specific details remain scarce. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the talks as productive and expressed optimism for a resolution, while acknowledging that any final agreement would need Moscow's approval. A 28-point peace proposal, reportedly originating from the U.S., has caused concern among European allies and in Kyiv, with accusations that it favors Russian demands, including territorial concessions. Despite these concerns, Rubio stated the proposal is a "living, breathing document" open to change. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized Ukraine's gratitude for U.S. support and reiterated that Russia initiated the conflict. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have expressed solidarity with Ukraine, stressing the importance of its sovereignty. Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to discuss reviving the Black Sea grain deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Confusion arose from reports that Rubio had described the U.S. peace plan as a "Russian wish list," a claim the State Department denied. U.S. lawmakers, however, maintained their account of Rubio's remarks, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the peace initiative.
