## Article summary
New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has reaffirmed his past criticisms of President Donald Trump, describing him as a despot and a fascist, despite a recent "surprisingly friendly" White House meeting. Mamdani stated in a "Meet the Press" interview that his views remain unchanged, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging disagreements while focusing on shared goals for New Yorkers. Trump, who had previously called Mamdani a "100% Communist Lunatic," interjected during the interview, suggesting Mamdani could simply say "yes" to the fascist question. Despite their past political animosity, both Trump and Mamdani emerged smiling from their meeting, discussing shared goals. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, commented that Trump aims to collaborate with all who prioritize the American people's future, even amidst policy disagreements. The White House meeting was seen as potentially beneficial for both men, offering Mamdani a one-on-one with the president and Trump an opportunity to address the issue of affordability.
