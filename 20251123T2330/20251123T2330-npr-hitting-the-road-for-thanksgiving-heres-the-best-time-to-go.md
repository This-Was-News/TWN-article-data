## Article summary
Thanksgiving travel is expected to reach record highs this year, with AAA projecting nearly 82 million Americans to travel at least 50 miles between November 25th and December 1st. The majority, around 73.2 million, will be driving, marking a slight increase from last year. Air travel is also anticipated to rise by 2% to 6 million people, though recent flight disruptions due to staffing shortages and a government shutdown could impact these numbers. The FAA has warned that Tuesday will be the busiest flying day, with air travel expected to be the busiest in 15 years. Travel via bus, train, and cruise is predicted to increase by 8.5%. To avoid traffic congestion, drivers are advised to travel before noon on Tuesday and Wednesday, with minimal traffic expected on Thanksgiving Day itself. Return journeys on Sunday after Thanksgiving are expected to be heavy, while Monday travel is best after 8:00 p.m. Weather forecasts indicate rain from Texas to Minnesota moving east from Monday to Wednesday, potentially causing disruptions. However, Thanksgiving Day is expected to be drier, though colder than average for much of the country. Lake-effect snow showers are possible near the Great Lakes. The return travel on Friday and Saturday should be decent for most, but a storm system developing over the weekend could bring heavy snow to the northern Plains and rain to parts of Texas and the Midwest.
