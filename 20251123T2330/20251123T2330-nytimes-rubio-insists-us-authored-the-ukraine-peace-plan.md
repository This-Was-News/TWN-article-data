## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated on Saturday that the United States developed a 28-point peace plan for the Ukraine war. This clarification came after Senator Mike Rounds claimed Rubio had suggested the plan was a Russian initiative. Rounds stated that Rubio indicated the U.S. was merely a recipient of a proposal, not its author. Critics have argued that the plan demands excessive concessions from Ukraine to Russia. A State Department spokesman, Tommy Pigott, refuted the claim that the plan was a Russian wish list, calling it 'blatantly false.' Pigott emphasized that the plan was authored by the United States, incorporating input from both Russia and Ukraine. The exchange occurred following a call between Rubio and U.S. lawmakers at a security conference in Canada.
