## Article summary
Ukrainian and American officials reported significant progress on Sunday in discussions regarding a U.S. proposal aimed at ending the war with Russia. This development occurred despite President Trump criticizing Ukraine for perceived ingratitude for American aid. Trump has mandated that Ukraine accept his 28-point peace plan by Thursday, a plan that has been met with skepticism in Ukraine due to its concessions to Russian demands. The talks, held in Geneva, were intended to reconcile differing viewpoints. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the initial discussions as productive, with both American and Ukrainian teams meticulously reviewing the peace plan, making necessary adjustments, and reducing discrepancies. Rubio expressed optimism that a peace agreement could be reached in a timely manner, noting that while some issues remain, they are not insurmountable and require additional time. The ongoing negotiations aim to find common ground acceptable to both Kyiv and Washington.
