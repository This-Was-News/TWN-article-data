## Article summary
More and more Ukrainian women are joining the military to fight against Russia, with over 70,000 women serving in the armed forces as of January, a 40% increase since 2021. While women are exempt from conscription, many are volunteering for combat roles, including fighter pilots, artillery commanders, and drone operators. Previously, women in combat roles were often misclassified, such as being listed as cooks despite being skilled snipers. A 2018 law allowed women to serve in combat positions and study all disciplines at military universities. Brigades like Khartiia and Azov are actively recruiting women, featuring them in advertising campaigns. Women in the military, like drone pilot Yevhenia and combat medic Olena Ivanenko, express a strong sense of duty and belonging. Despite facing challenges and personal sacrifices, including the loss of friends and the emotional toll of war, these women are determined to fight for their country. The war has also spurred rapid innovation in weaponry, with elite units developing advanced sea drones. The increasing presence of women in the military highlights their commitment to defending Ukraine, even as the conflict continues with no end in sight.
