## Article summary
The podcast "I've Had It," hosted by Jennifer Welch and Angie "Pumps" Sullivan, has gained significant popularity among disaffected Democrats. The show features two middle-aged women from Oklahoma who use raw, unvarnished language to criticize both Republicans and Democratic leaders for not being combative enough. Welch and Sullivan, with backgrounds as an interior designer and attorney respectively, express frustration with the Democratic Party's perceived inaction and lack of evolution, feeling that leaders like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer rely too much on strongly worded letters instead of decisive action. Their direct critiques, sometimes aimed at politicians like Senator Cory Booker, resonate with a liberal base who feel the party isn't sufficiently fighting against policies and figures like Donald Trump. The podcast's viral success across platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok is attributed to its conversational, sometimes gossipy, and often impolite tone, which mirrors the way some politicians, like Trump, engage with audiences. "I've Had It" aims to push elected officials to be more responsive to voters, attracting a diverse audience across different age groups and geographic locations. The hosts believe their relatable, self-deprecating humor makes them approachable, like "gal pals" offering political commentary. Their show is positioned in a political podcast landscape often dominated by men, offering a unique voice that challenges the status quo within the Democratic Party.
