## Article summary
A Utah judge has rejected a congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers and adopted an alternate proposal that creates a Democratic-leaning district for the 2026 midterm elections. Judge Dianna Gibson ruled that the Legislature's map unduly favored Republicans and disfavored Democrats, violating standards established by voters to prevent gerrymandering. The judge selected a map submitted by the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government, which consolidates Salt Lake County into a single district. This decision presents a challenge for Utah Republicans, who currently hold all four U.S. House seats and had aimed to protect them. Lieutenant Governor Deidre Henderson indicated an emergency appeal is likely, but the state must begin implementing the new boundaries. This ruling gives Utah Democrats a significantly better chance to flip a seat, as the state has not had a Democratic representative in Congress since early 2021. Republicans argue the judge overstepped her authority, with one state representative calling for her impeachment. This redistricting battle occurs amidst a national push, influenced by former President Donald Trump, for Republican-led states to redraw districts to benefit the GOP. However, Democrats are also fighting back with their own redistricting efforts in several states, aiming to offset Republican gains.
