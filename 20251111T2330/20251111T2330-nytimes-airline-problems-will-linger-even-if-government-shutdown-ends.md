## Article summary
Even if the federal government shutdown ends, the disruptions to air travel will not immediately cease. The shutdown has exacerbated existing issues within the nation's aviation system, particularly a shortage of air traffic controllers. Approximately 3,000 controllers are needed, leading to long and stressful schedules for the current workforce. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered airlines to cut flights at 40 busy airports due to these staffing shortages and the stress on controllers. This led to thousands of flight cancellations over the weekend, with Sunday being the fourth-worst day of the year for cancellations. The restrictions were set to increase, threatening Thanksgiving travel chaos. While a deal to end the shutdown has been approved by the Senate, it will take days for airlines to recover. Carriers canceled flights in advance to manage disruptions, and resuming full capacity will not be immediate. The aviation industry has been urging Congress to address the ailing air traffic control system, which requires modernization and more staff. Despite federal funding allocated for modernization, the shutdown has hindered progress. Residual effects of the cancellations and schedule reductions are expected to last for days even after the government reopens.
