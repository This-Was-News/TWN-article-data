## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has extended an order that blocks full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments, creating a chaotic situation for beneficiaries. This decision comes as there are signals that a government shutdown may be nearing an end. The Supreme Court's order will expire just before midnight on Thursday. The Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown, and the House of Representatives is expected to vote on it soon. Reopening the government would restart the SNAP program, which assists 42 million Americans, but it's unclear how quickly full payments would resume. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only justice who indicated she would have revived the lower court orders immediately. Beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly benefits, while others have received nothing, and some states have issued partial payments. The Trump administration had chosen to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown, leading to lawsuits and conflicting court rulings. The administration had previously agreed to provide up to 65% of regular benefits but balked when a judge ordered full funding for November. The Supreme Court's intervention allows Congress to continue its progress in resolving the shutdown.
