## Article summary
California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized former President Donald Trump's absence from United Nations climate negotiations as "doubling down on stupid," warning that the U.S. risks economic decline by not engaging in green energy. Newsom, attending the COP30 talks in Brazil, highlighted California's commitment to climate action as a contrast to Trump's policies that reversed environmental regulations and supported fossil fuels. He argued that other nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, are embracing green energy, while Trump's approach isolates the U.S. and cedes economic power, particularly to China. Newsom pointed to the tangible impacts of climate change, such as increased wildfires, heat, and extreme weather in California, as evidence that science is undeniable. He also addressed the state's challenges in balancing ambitious climate goals with energy demands and high costs, including extending the life of its last nuclear plant and investing in new technologies. Despite federal inaction, Newsom emphasized the importance of sub-national leaders like governors and mayors participating in global climate efforts. A White House spokesperson, however, dismissed Newsom's efforts as a "Green New Scam," defending Trump's energy agenda.
