## Article summary
The White House is considering a 50-year mortgage to address the home affordability crisis, a proposal that has drawn significant criticism. While extending the mortgage term would lower monthly payments, experts argue it would do little to solve core issues like housing supply shortages and high interest rates. A 50-year mortgage would result in substantially more interest paid over the life of the loan and significantly slow down equity accumulation. For instance, it could take 30 years to build $100,000 in equity compared to 12-13 years with a 30-year mortgage. Critics also point out that this proposal does not address the fundamental lack of housing supply, which is exacerbated by high construction costs and labor shortages. Furthermore, a 50-year term poses challenges for older first-time homebuyers, potentially extending repayment into their retirement or even beyond their lifespan. The extended loan terms in other financial sectors, like auto and student loans, have also seen mixed results with rising delinquencies. Economists warn that a 50-year mortgage could inflate home prices by increasing demand in a supply-constrained market. Additionally, current financial regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act prevent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from insuring mortgages longer than 30 years, requiring significant legislative changes that currently lack broad support in Congress.
