## Article summary
The longest government shutdown in U.S. history has ended, but the core issue of soaring health care costs remains unresolved and will continue to be a major challenge for President Trump, especially with midterm elections approaching. Republicans are now under pressure to present a viable plan to lower healthcare expenses, as President Trump has yet to offer a concrete alternative to Obamacare beyond a vague idea of sending money directly to policyholders. This proposal suggests giving patients a greater role in purchasing their own care, with the assumption that this will lead to lower costs and better health outcomes, although evidence supporting this approach is not strong. Millions of Americans face increased premiums and potential loss of insurance as subsidies expire, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that two million people could lose coverage next year. While the Affordable Care Act has been criticized for not constraining costs, it has successfully expanded health coverage to tens of millions. Democrats have made healthcare costs a central campaign issue, recalling Republicans' failed attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare. President Trump's policy efforts on healthcare have largely focused on ancillary issues like price transparency and prescription drug discounts, rather than comprehensive reform. While some Republicans have proposed ideas, none have gained significant traction, and the debate over healthcare affordability is now in the political spotlight.
