## Article summary
President Trump declared the end of the longest government shutdown a significant victory for Republicans during a Veterans Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery. He mixed solemn tributes to service members with political arguments, celebrating his efforts to rename the Defense Department back to the Department of War. The shutdown deal, passed by the Senate, avoids impacting federal worker and military pay, though it omits healthcare subsidies Democrats sought. Trump criticized Democrats for the shutdown, stating they were unsuccessful in their renegotiations. He expressed a desire to move away from political correctness and stated the U.S. would fight wars solely to win. The speech highlighted Trump's unconventional use of the military, including deploying troops to the border and to Democratic-led cities, actions military historians find unusual. Some service members reportedly feel uncomfortable with how Trump is utilizing the military. The speech also touched on Veterans Affairs, with Trump bragging about firings of "sick people" while critics point to firings of veteran federal employees and disruptions to veteran programs. The administration promoted its opening of 20 new veterans health facilities.
