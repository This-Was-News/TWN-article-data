## Article summary
President Donald Trump has proposed a "tariff dividend" of at least $2,000 per person, excluding high-income individuals, funded by the revenue generated from his tariffs. This proposal comes after his party's electoral losses, attributed partly to voter dissatisfaction with the cost of living. However, budget experts and economists are skeptical, arguing that the numbers do not add up. The Tax Foundation's Erica York stated that the idea of a dividend is flawed and that the revenue from tariffs is insufficient to cover such payments. Even Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, seemed uncertain about the plan, suggesting it might manifest as tax cuts rather than direct checks. While tariffs did generate $195 billion in the last fiscal year, this is a small fraction of federal revenue and has not significantly reduced the deficit. Analysts estimate that even if tariffs brought in $200 billion to $300 billion annually, a $2,000 dividend for all Americans would cost around $600 billion. Furthermore, implementing such a dividend would likely require congressional legislation, which is not guaranteed. Adding to the uncertainty, the Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of Trump's broad tariff powers, and a decision against him could lead to refunds for importers instead of dividends for citizens. Mainstream economists argue that tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers through higher prices, suggesting that removing tariffs would be a more direct way to provide relief to Americans.
