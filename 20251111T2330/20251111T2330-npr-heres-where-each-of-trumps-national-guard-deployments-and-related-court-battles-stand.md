## Article summary
President Trump has escalated the use of the National Guard, deploying troops to nearly a dozen cities, primarily in states with Democratic leadership, to address crime, protests, and safeguard federal property. These deployments have triggered significant legal challenges and protests across the country. In Portland, a federal judge permanently blocked troop deployment for anti-ICE protests, ruling federal action unjustified. The Trump administration is expected to appeal this decision. Chicago's National Guard deployment is currently on hold due to a restraining order, with the Supreme Court yet to rule on an emergency appeal. Illinois and Chicago have sued the administration, deeming the deployment unlawful. In Tennessee, a lawsuit challenges the deployment of the state's National Guard to Memphis, arguing it doesn't meet the constitutional standard for such actions. Washington D.C. also sued over troop deployment, alleging violations of the Home Rule Act. A West Virginia judge, however, allowed the state's National Guard deployment to D.C. to continue. California is engaged in a legal battle with the federal government over troop deployment to Los Angeles, asserting the administration exceeded its authority. Trump has also suggested troop deployments to other cities like New Orleans and New York City, citing public safety concerns. Some Republican-led states, like Missouri and Louisiana, have welcomed federal assistance, requesting National Guard support for federal agencies and crime reduction efforts.
