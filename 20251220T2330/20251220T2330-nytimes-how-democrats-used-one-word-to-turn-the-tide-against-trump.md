## Article summary
Democrats have successfully leveraged the concept of 'affordability' as a potent political message, particularly in their efforts to challenge former President Trump. Initially introduced by Representative Mikie Sherrill, the term quickly gained traction within the Democratic Party, resonating with voters concerned about the rising cost of living. This focus on affordability, encompassing expenses like housing, child care, and healthcare, proved instrumental in Democratic victories during recent elections. Strategists believe the term resonates more effectively than abstract economic jargon because it directly addresses voters' personal financial anxieties and their perception of falling behind. Despite Trump's attempts to dismiss 'affordability' as a political tactic, his own campaign has adopted an 'affordability tour,' indicating the issue's significance. The Democratic Party's shift towards affordability is seen as a response to past messaging failures, such as the focus on 'Bidenomics,' which did not adequately address voters' immediate economic concerns. This new message has cut across various demographics, proving to be a unifying theme for the party. The success of candidates like Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, who centered their campaigns on affordability, underscores its impact. As both parties prepare for future elections, affordability is expected to remain a central theme in the political discourse, reflecting the ongoing economic worries of American voters.
