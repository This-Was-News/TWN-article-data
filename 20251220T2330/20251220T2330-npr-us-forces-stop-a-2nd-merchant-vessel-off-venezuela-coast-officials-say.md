## Article summary
U.S. forces have stopped a second merchant vessel off the coast of Venezuela, marking an escalation in President Donald Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. This action follows the recent seizure of an oil tanker and Trump's announcement of a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela. Officials described the latest incident as a "consented boarding," where the vessel voluntarily allowed U.S. forces aboard. The White House and Pentagon have not yet commented on the operation. Trump has intensified his rhetoric towards Maduro, asserting that the Venezuelan leader's time in power is limited. He has also demanded the return of assets seized from U.S. oil companies, citing these disputes as a justification for the blockade. Trump stated that the U.S. will prevent unauthorized vessels from passing, referencing the "illegal" seizure of American energy rights by Venezuela. This move comes amid broader U.S. actions, including strikes in Syria targeting Islamic State fighters, and as Venezuela braces for potential hardship due to the threatened oil blockade.
