## Article summary
The U.S. launched significant airstrikes in Syria targeting Islamic State (IS) fighters and weapons sites in retaliation for an attack that killed two U.S. troops and an American civilian interpreter. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the operation was a "declaration of vengeance" and that the U.S. "will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people." President Donald Trump described the strikes as "massive" and warned IS against future attacks, vowing "YOU WILL BE HIT HARDER THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN HIT BEFORE." The strikes involved F-15 Eagle jets, A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft, AH-64 Apache helicopters, F-16 fighter jets from Jordan, and HIMARS rocket artillery, employing over 100 precision munitions. This military action occurs as the Trump administration has been shifting resources to the Western Hemisphere. The attack that prompted the retaliation was carried out by a gunman who had recently joined Syria's internal security forces and was suspected of IS affiliation. Syria's foreign ministry affirmed its commitment to combating terrorism and intensifying operations against IS. The U.S. troops killed were Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, along with civilian interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat. The Pentagon stated that the strikes were not the beginning of a war but a response to the deaths of Americans.
