## Article summary
A viral economics essay sparked debate by suggesting a family of four needs $140,000 annually to function in American society, challenging the outdated poverty line. While economists argue modern middle-class families are wealthier than in the 1960s, with access to luxuries like smartphones and flights, many young Americans feel life is unaffordable. They describe a sense of futility, where basic middle-class aspirations like homeownership and providing for children seem unattainable without significant sacrifices. This contrasts sharply with the expectations of previous generations, who believed hard work guaranteed a better life than their parents. The definition of 'need' has evolved beyond mere survival to include cultural and societal expectations, with housing costs being a major barrier. Many young adults are delaying or forgoing homeownership, opting for different lifestyle choices due to financial pessimism. Even those who manage to buy homes often rely on significant financial assistance or geographic compromises. The accumulation of wealth is slower for younger generations compared to baby boomers, leading to feelings of being stuck. The desire to provide a better future for children is complicated by current financial realities, with many hesitant to bring children into a world where they themselves struggle. The perceived "price of participation" in middle-class life has dramatically increased, leading to difficult trade-offs and a questioning of long-held American dreams.
