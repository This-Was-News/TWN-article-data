## Article summary
The Koch political operation, founded by Charles and David Koch, spent nearly $550 million during the 2024 election cycle, demonstrating its continued financial influence despite opposition to President Trump's re-election. During this period, the network raised approximately $578 million and spent $548 million, with its flagship organizations, Americans for Prosperity and Americans for Prosperity Action, receiving substantial donations. A significant portion of the funds originated from over $5 billion in Koch Industries stock directed into the network between 2020 and 2022. Americans for Prosperity alone raised $215 million in 2023, its highest annual total, largely funding its grassroots operations. The Koch network notably supported Nikki Haley's presidential bid, spending over $40 million on her behalf, which highlighted the rift with President Trump. This spending contrasts with the estimated $250 million spent in the 2016 cycle, a figure that is less precise due to the use of nonprofit groups. The operation restructured after Trump's 2016 victory and the death of David Koch in 2019, centralizing under the name Stand Together. Beyond electoral politics, the Koch family continues to fund libertarian-aligned think tanks and focus on non-political initiatives like criminal-justice reform. The network's financial structure involves a chain of nonprofit groups, including Key Change Inc. and Believe in People Inc., which funneled funds to Stand Together C4 Fund, and subsequently to Americans for Prosperity and the Stand Together Chamber of Commerce. Despite recent financial support for extending Trump's first-term tax cuts, tensions persist between the Koch network and President Trump, as evidenced by his public remarks.
