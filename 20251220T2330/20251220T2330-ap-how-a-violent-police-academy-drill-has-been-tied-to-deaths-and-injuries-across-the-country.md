## Article summary
A review by The Associated Press has revealed that since 2005, police training drills intended to teach defensive tactics have been linked to at least a dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries, some resulting in disability. These drills, often referred to as RedMan training, are designed to prepare law enforcement recruits for confrontations with combative suspects. However, critics argue that these exercises can lead to physical and mental abuse, causing promising officers to leave the profession. The training methods vary across academies, with some recruits facing multiple assailants or instructors sequentially. Despite the risks, there is a lack of national standards governing these exercises, including requirements for on-site medical personnel. One recruit, Heather Sterling, who suffered a concussion during a drill at the Texas Game Warden Training Center, is now speaking out against the practice, describing it as a "poorly disguised assault" and expressing concern that someone could be killed. Her experience highlights the potential for severe injury and trauma, even when protective gear is worn. The AP's investigation into these drills follows a string of tragedies across the nation that have brought increased scrutiny to law enforcement academy curricula. Examples include the death of a recruit after a training exercise at the San Francisco Police Department Academy and another recruit's death due to accidental drowning during a pool training fight in Kentucky. A Denver police recruit also suffered the amputation of both legs after a training fight.
