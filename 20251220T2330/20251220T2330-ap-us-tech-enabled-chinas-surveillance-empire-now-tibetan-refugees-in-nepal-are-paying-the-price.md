## Article summary
Chinese surveillance technology, developed with foundational U.S. tech, is being used to monitor and suppress Tibetan refugees in Nepal. Thousands of CCTV cameras, supplied by Chinese companies like Hikvision and Dahua, are now ubiquitous in Kathmandu, stifling the Free Tibet movement. This surveillance network is part of China's global influence strategy, offering cost-effective policing solutions to cash-strapped governments. Despite U.S. sanctions and human rights concerns, American tech giants like Amazon Web Services continue to provide cloud services to these Chinese firms. The investigation reveals that U.S. companies played a significant role in building China's surveillance state, with the U.S. government often facilitating technology sales to Chinese police. The number of Tibetans fleeing to Nepal has dramatically decreased due to tight border controls, warming Nepal-China ties, and intense surveillance. Chinese companies like Uniview and Hytera, with origins in U.S. technology, have also supplied surveillance and communication equipment to Nepal. This digital dragnet extends deep into the lives of those near the Chinese border, turning Nepal into what some refugees describe as a "second China." The pervasive surveillance instills fear, forcing many Tibetans to live in silence and private, effectively turning their sanctuary into a prison.
