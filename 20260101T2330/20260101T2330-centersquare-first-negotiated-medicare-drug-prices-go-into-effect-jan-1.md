## Article summary
Negotiated lower Medicare costs for 10 popular prescription drugs took effect on January 1. These drugs, including Eliquis, Enbrel, and Januvia, are used to treat conditions like diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and heart failure. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 authorized the Health and Human Services Department to negotiate maximum prices for these drugs with manufacturers. The negotiated prices range from 38% to 79% below their list prices. For example, the blood thinner Eliquis, previously costing $521 for a 30-day supply, will now have a maximum charge of $231 for applicable Medicare plans. Januvia, used for diabetes, saw the largest reduction, dropping from $527 to $113 per month. Insulins Fiasp and Novolog also experienced a 76% price slash. Imbruvica, used for blood cancers, had the smallest reduction at 38%. The actual savings for Medicare Part D and Advantage plan enrollees will depend on their specific insurance plans, as coverage varies among private insurers. All Part D and Advantage plans with drug coverage are required to cover these 10 negotiated drugs. This Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program aims to reduce Medicare spending on prescription drugs and ensure the program's long-term sustainability.
