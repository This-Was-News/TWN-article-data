## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, the newly inaugurated mayor of New York City, has pledged to govern as a democratic socialist, embracing big government principles. In his first address on New Year's Day, Mamdani vowed to implement free programs for the city's 8.5 million residents, emphasizing safety, affordability, and abundance. He plans to expand the city's government to achieve these goals, a strategy that contrasts with Republican opposition. Mamdani's campaign promises included rent freezes, free citywide buses, universal childcare, and a significant increase in the minimum wage. He intends to fund these initiatives by raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers and businesses. However, the mayor lacks the direct authority to increase taxes, which will require legislative action. Mamdani, a former state representative and rapper, was joined at his inauguration by prominent democratic socialists Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He stated his administration would govern expansively and audaciously, using the city's power to improve residents' lives.
