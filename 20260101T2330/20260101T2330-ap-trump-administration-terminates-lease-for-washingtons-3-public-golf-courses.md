## Article summary
The Trump administration has terminated the lease agreement for three public golf courses in Washington D.C., operated by the nonprofit National Links Trust. The Department of the Interior cited the nonprofit's failure to implement required capital improvements and meet lease terms as the reason for termination. The National Links Trust expressed devastation, stating they had invested $8.5 million in improvements and doubled rounds played and revenue during their tenure. Despite the setback, they remain hopeful for a solution to preserve public golf. This decision aligns with a broader pattern of the Trump administration rebranding civic spaces in Washington, including renaming the Kennedy Center and initiating construction projects at the White House. The termination provides President Trump, whose company has a history of golf course development, an opportunity to influence these prominent public spaces.
