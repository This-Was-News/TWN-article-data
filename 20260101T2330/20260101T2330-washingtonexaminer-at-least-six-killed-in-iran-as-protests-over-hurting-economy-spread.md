## Article summary
Protests over Iran's struggling economy have resulted in at least six fatalities, marking the first reported deaths related to the demonstrations. The unrest began on Sunday in Tehran with shopkeepers protesting and has since expanded nationwide, becoming the largest national demonstration since 2022. These protests coincide with the Iranian currency reaching an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and a significant increase in the cost of living, exacerbated by 40% tariffs imposed by Western nations. The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, expressed solidarity with the Iranian people, stating that the Trump administration supports their desire for freedom and their protest against a regime that has led to economic decline and conflict. While officials have not released the identities of all those killed, human rights organizations have confirmed that at least two of the deceased were protesters. The protests have primarily occurred in cities within a region predominantly inhabited by the Lur ethnic group.
