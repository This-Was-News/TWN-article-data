## Article summary
Millions of Americans are facing increased health insurance costs as Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies have expired. A bipartisan group of senators is working on a compromise to reinstate these subsidies, aiming to mitigate the financial burden on Obamacare enrollees. Senator Peter Welch believes that President Trump's support is crucial for the passage of any legislation, given his influence over Republican lawmakers. Welch suggests that reforms like income caps, copays, and penalties for insurer fraud could be included in a renewed subsidy extension. The expiration of these subsidies is expected to cause significant financial hardship for individuals and reduce revenue for rural hospitals. In the House of Representatives, a discharge petition has been initiated by four Republicans and Democrats to force a vote on a three-year ACA subsidy extension. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick expressed his willingness to support a clean extension if no other option is available, anticipating similar views from his Republican colleagues. Moderate senators and House members have been discussing potential legislative paths forward. The Senate is set to reconvene on January 5th, followed by the House on January 6th, with hopes that the rising costs will spur congressional action.
