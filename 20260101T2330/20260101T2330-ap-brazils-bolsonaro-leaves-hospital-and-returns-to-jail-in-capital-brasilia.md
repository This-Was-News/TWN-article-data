## Article summary
Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been released from a hospital in Brasilia, where he underwent double hernia surgery. He was transported back to the federal police headquarters to continue serving his 27-year prison sentence for leading a coup d'état. The Supreme Court had approved his temporary release for the surgery, but denied his request for house arrest. Bolsonaro has a history of medical procedures following an abdominal stabbing in 2018. His prison quarters are described as a 12-square-meter room with basic amenities. In a recent political development, Bolsonaro appointed his son, Flávio Bolsonaro, as his political party's presidential candidate for the upcoming election. His wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, expressed support for him on social media, stating, "We will beat the bad days." Bolsonaro and his allies were convicted in September for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democratic system, a plot that included plans to assassinate political figures and incite insurrection. He has denied all accusations of wrongdoing.
