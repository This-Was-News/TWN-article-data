## Article summary
The year 2026 is poised to be a critical juncture for Donald Trump's second term as president, with Republican majorities in both houses of Congress facing midterm elections in November. Should Republicans lose control of either chamber, Trump's legislative agenda for the remainder of his presidency would face significant hurdles. The House of Representatives, with its slim GOP majority, holds the power to initiate all tax and spending legislation, as well as impeachment proceedings. Conversely, the Senate confirms executive and judicial appointments, and a Democratic majority there could stall new nominees and freeze the Cabinet. The economy, particularly inflation and the cost of living, is expected to be a dominant issue in both the midterms and the upcoming 2028 presidential race, where Vice President JD Vance is being positioned as a successor. Trump's economic policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, may become more apparent in 2026, with potential to replace the Federal Reserve chairman. However, his ability to shape the economic narrative could be limited to the next twelve months, drawing parallels to Ronald Reagan's struggles with inflation in the early 1980s. Trump enters 2026 with a job approval rating of 43.4%, comparable to past presidents at similar stages, though his economic approval is lower. Historically, the party controlling the White House tends to lose congressional seats in midterm elections, a trend Republicans hope to defy by leveraging safe red seats and early redistricting. Despite these efforts, redistricting has yielded mixed results for Republicans, and early retirements within the House GOP add to their challenges. Ultimately, 2026 presents Trump with a crucial window to solidify his legacy before potential Democratic interference.
