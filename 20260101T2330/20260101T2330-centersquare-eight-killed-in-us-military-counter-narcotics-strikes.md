## Article summary
The U.S. military conducted five lethal kinetic strikes on drug boats in the Caribbean in the final days of 2025, resulting in the deaths of eight individuals, according to U.S. Southern Command. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth authorized these strikes, which targeted three vessels on December 30 and two on December 31. These vessels were reportedly operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations and were intercepted along known narco-trafficking routes in international waters. The U.S. Coast Guard was deployed to search for survivors. These strikes are part of President Donald Trump's Joint Task Force Southern Spear, which has intensified counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. This series of strikes follows the U.S.'s first known land strike against Venezuela on a suspected drug loading site. Hegseth declared 2025 a historic year for U.S. military operations and indicated that more actions are planned for 2026.
