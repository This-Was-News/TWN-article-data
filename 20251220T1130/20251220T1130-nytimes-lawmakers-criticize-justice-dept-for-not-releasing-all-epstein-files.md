## Article summary
Lawmakers from both parties are criticizing the Justice Department for failing to fully comply with a law requiring the release of all Jeffrey Epstein-related material. Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, who co-authored the statute, stated that the release is incomplete, with excessive redactions and missing documents, including a draft indictment that could implicate others. They are considering impeachment, contempt of Congress, or prosecution for obstruction of justice. The law, signed by President Trump, mandated the release by Friday, allowing for redactions. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche acknowledged in a letter that the review and redaction process was ongoing and expected to take another two weeks. Democrats, including Representatives Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, are exploring legal options due to this violation. While most Republicans remained silent, Democrats, like Senator Chuck Schumer, condemned the "mountain of blacked out pages" as a violation of transparency and the law. The Justice Department is also required to provide a report detailing withheld records, mentioned individuals, and the reasoning for redactions within 15 days of the file release.
