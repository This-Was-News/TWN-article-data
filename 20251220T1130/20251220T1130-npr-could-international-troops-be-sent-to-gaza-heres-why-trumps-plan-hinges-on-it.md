## Article summary
The U.S.-backed Gaza ceasefire is facing critical challenges, primarily concerning the deployment of an international force and the disarmament of Hamas. While the U.S. envisions international troops supporting Gaza's demilitarization and dismantling terrorist infrastructure, many countries are hesitant to confront Hamas militarily. The United Nations Security Council has mandated international troops until the end of 2027, but their exact role remains unclear. A recent U.S.-convened meeting in Qatar discussed plans for an International Stabilization Force (ISF), with countries like Italy, Egypt, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey being considered, though no formal commitments have been made. Turkey has expressed willingness to play a leading role as peacekeepers along a border zone, not to disarm Hamas. Similarly, Egypt has indicated a preference for peacekeeping and monitoring roles. Israel, however, is skeptical about the capability of an international force to disarm Hamas and objects to Turkey's potential involvement. Hamas has stated it would welcome the ISF as a peacekeeping buffer but insists disarmament must be linked to a political process ending with a Palestinian state and should occur concurrently with Israeli troop withdrawal and the opening of the Rafah border. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire, with insufficient aid reaching the population and widespread destruction of homes, exacerbated by recent storms.
