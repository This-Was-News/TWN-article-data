## Article summary
Victims of Jeffrey Epstein expressed disappointment and frustration with the Justice Department's partial release of files related to the investigations into his sexual abuse. They stated that the thousands of heavily redacted pages and photographs did not provide new insights into the scope of his crimes or identify potential conspirators. Victims like Jess Michaels and Marijke Chartouni voiced suspicion, feeling the lack of transparency suggests a continued cover-up. One document revealed that Maria Farmer filed a federal child pornography complaint against Epstein in 1996, but the FBI did not thoroughly investigate until a decade later. Farmer felt vindicated seeing the document but heartbroken that her complaint was not acted upon sooner. Annie Farmer, Maria's sister, echoed the disappointment in the general lack of transparency. Marina Larcerda, another victim, found many photos irrelevant and expressed that they were let down, hoping for justice for other protected men. The victims had pushed for the release of these files, hoping for greater transparency and accountability.
