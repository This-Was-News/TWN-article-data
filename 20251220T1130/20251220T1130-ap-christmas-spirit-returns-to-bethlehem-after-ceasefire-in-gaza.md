## Article summary
Christmas spirit has returned to Bethlehem after a ceasefire in Gaza, bringing a much-needed economic boost and a sense of hope to the city. For the past two years, the traditional festivities were subdued due to the ongoing conflict. This year, however, Manger Square is once again bustling with lights, a Christmas market, and music, signaling a return to normalcy and celebration. The ceasefire has allowed families to flock back to the city, revitalizing its tourism-dependent economy, which had seen unemployment soar from 14% to 65%. Despite the return of festivities, tensions remain high in the West Bank, with frequent Israeli military raids and an increase in settler attacks against Palestinians. The Christian population in Bethlehem, which accounts for less than 2% of the West Bank's residents, has been shrinking due to poverty and conflict, with many leaving in search of work. Singing in the Church of the Nativity's grotto during midnight Mass has taken on deeper meaning, serving as a message of hope and a reminder of the endurance of Christianity in the Holy Land. Choir members express hope that the Christian population in the region will not decline further. The return of Christmas celebrations, including a tree lighting in Manger Square, has provided a much-needed boost of joy amidst the ongoing devastation in Gaza. Residents continue to pray for peace in the land where the Prince of Peace was born.
