## Article summary
The U.S. Treasury is urging states to adopt President Donald Trump's recent tax cuts, which include deductions for tips, overtime, vehicle loans, and business equipment. However, states are divided on whether to implement these changes, with some automatically conforming to federal tax laws while others require legislative action. Adopting all the tax cuts could save residents and businesses hundreds of millions annually, but may also strain state budgets due to increased costs for programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Several states, including Michigan, have begun to opt in or out of specific provisions. Michigan, for instance, adopted tax breaks for tips and overtime but decoupled from some corporate tax changes to manage its budget. Other states, like Illinois, have rejected corporate tax cuts to maintain funding for essential services. Lawmakers face decisions on whether to apply these changes retroactively for 2025 or for the upcoming 2026 tax year. The debate highlights the tension between providing immediate financial relief to taxpayers and ensuring states can meet their fiscal obligations.
