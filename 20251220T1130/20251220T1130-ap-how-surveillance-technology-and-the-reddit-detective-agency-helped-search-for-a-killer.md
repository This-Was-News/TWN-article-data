## Article summary
The search for a suspect in a Brown University shooting highlighted the evolving role of surveillance technology and online communities. While advanced AI-powered surveillance systems, including license plate readers, eventually helped track the suspect's vehicle, they were initially insufficient in locating the gunman who evaded detection for days. This contrasts with the Boston Marathon bombing investigation a decade prior, where online sleuths on Reddit were criticized for spreading misinformation. In the recent case, an anonymous tipster on Reddit provided crucial information that allowed police to identify the suspect's car. This Reddit user, dubbed 'Reddit Guy,' is being hailed as a hero, contrasting sharply with the false accusations that plagued the Boston investigation. Moderators on Reddit's Providence forum actively worked to prevent the spread of harmful speculation, learning from past mistakes. The surveillance cameras, operated by Flock Safety, spotted the suspect's vehicle multiple times, but the company emphasizes their focus on vehicles, not people. Ultimately, it was the keen observation of a local resident, shared on Reddit, that re-energized the investigation and led to the suspect's discovery. The case underscores the complex interplay between sophisticated technology and human observation in modern criminal investigations, with online communities playing a more constructive role than in the past.
