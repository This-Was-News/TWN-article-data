## Article summary
The Justice Department has released over 13,000 files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender who died in jail in 2019. This release, prompted by congressional pressure and a law signed by President Trump, was long-awaited by those seeking insight into Epstein's activities and his connections to powerful individuals. However, the first batch of documents offered few major revelations, adding little to the public's understanding of Epstein's conduct or his associations. Many of the materials, including investigative documents, phone records, and travel logs, were heavily redacted, with some files entirely blacked out. Despite expectations from some of Trump's supporters that the files would implicate prominent Democrats, the reaction from the right was muted due to the lack of new incriminating information. Former President Bill Clinton was prominently featured in many photographs, some of which were released by the White House to political advantage, though Clinton's spokesman suggested this was a distraction from Trump's own relationship with Epstein. References to Donald Trump in the released materials were minimal, mostly appearing in already-public documents like his address book and flight logs, as well as in transcripts of interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell. The files did, however, illustrate Epstein's ability to attract a wide range of famous people into his orbit, from musicians to news anchors, though without suggesting any involvement in his illicit activities. The Justice Department indicated that more documents would be released in the coming weeks, potentially violating the law's 30-day deadline and drawing criticism from members of Congress.
