## Article summary
Luigi Mangione's lawyers are arguing that Attorney General Pam Bondi's decision to pursue the death penalty against him for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was compromised by a conflict of interest. They claim Bondi previously worked as a lobbyist for a firm that represented UnitedHealth Group's parent company, creating a conflict that violates Mangione's due process rights. The defense asserts that Bondi's continued financial ties to the lobbying firm, even after joining the Justice Department, mean she has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting. Mangione's lawyers are requesting that prosecutors be barred from seeking the death penalty and that some charges be dismissed. They point to a vow Bondi made to recuse herself from matters involving former clients for a year after taking office, which they argue she has violated. Bondi had previously announced her intention to seek the death penalty, calling the killing a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination." Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The defense team wants to investigate Bondi's financial connections to the lobbying firm and its relationship with UnitedHealthcare. Federal prosecutors, however, argue that pretrial publicity does not constitute a constitutional defect and that prospective jurors can be questioned to ensure Mangione's rights are respected.
