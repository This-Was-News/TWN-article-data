## Article summary
Apple and Google are advising some employees on H-1B visas to avoid international travel due to significant delays in visa appointments at U.S. consulates and embassies. These delays are attributed to new Department of Homeland Security rules requiring extensive social media screening for visa applicants. The tech giants, which rely heavily on foreign talent, are concerned that employees might get stranded abroad if their visas are not processed promptly upon return. Law firms working with Google and Apple have issued memos to employees, strongly recommending against foreign travel for now. This situation highlights the impact of the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies on the foreign-born workforce in the U.S. Earlier this year, a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas was announced, affecting tech companies' ability to hire skilled workers. Reports indicate that hundreds of visa holders have already faced appointment postponements when attempting to renew their H-1Bs abroad. The Alphabet Workers' Union at Google is advocating for more protections for H-1B visa holders, emphasizing their vulnerability, especially in light of potential layoffs and increased government scrutiny.
