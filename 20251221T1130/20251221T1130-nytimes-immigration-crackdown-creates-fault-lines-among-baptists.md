## Article summary
The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., is experiencing internal divisions over immigration policy. While historically supportive of immigration reform due to missionary work and theological commitments, a growing contingent, led by pastors like Lewis Richerson, supports the current administration's immigration crackdown, emphasizing obedience to the law and theological reasons for deportation. This contrasts with the Catholic Church's more unified stance against the administration's actions. The denomination's public policy arm, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, which championed immigration reform, has faced challenges, including a vote to dismantle it and a severed tie with the Evangelical Immigration Table. Despite these fractures, many rank-and-file churches continue to support immigrant ministries. Some pastors express concern that the crackdowns are negatively impacting their outreach, citing decreased attendance in ESL programs and difficulties ministering to immigrant communities. Others, however, prioritize different issues or align with the denomination's predominantly white and Republican demographic, which tends to support the administration's broader agenda. Despite the vocal opposition from some, many Southern Baptists continue to minister to and support immigrants, emphasizing unity across differences within the denomination.
