## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV has called for a significant assembly of the world's cardinals to convene in Rome on January 7-8. This meeting, known as a consistory, will be the first major gathering since the conclusion of the 2025 Holy Year and marks a pivotal moment for the new pontificate. Unlike his predecessor, Pope Francis, who preferred a smaller group of advisors, Pope Leo XIV is opting for a broader consultation with all cardinals. The consistory is intended to foster collective discernment and provide support and advice to the Pope in governing the universal Church. This assembly signifies Pope Leo's intention to establish his own agenda and leadership style after his initial months, which were largely dedicated to fulfilling Holy Year obligations and concluding matters from the previous papacy. This is a purely consultative meeting, with no new cardinals being installed. The gathering is seen as the unofficial start of Pope Leo's papacy, allowing him to look forward and shape the future direction of the Catholic Church.
