## Article summary
Russia's presidential foreign policy advisor, Yuri Ushakov, has stated that talks regarding a U.S.-proposed peace plan for Ukraine are proceeding constructively. These discussions are part of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to broker peace, which have included previous meetings with Ukrainian and European officials. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, reported that the talks in Miami were progressing well and were expected to continue. Dmitriev met with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, during these discussions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated that future developments would depend on the U.S. stance following these meetings. This diplomatic push by Trump faces challenges due to the conflicting demands of Moscow and Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained his maximalist demands, even as Russian forces advance in Ukraine. Meanwhile, European Union leaders have agreed to provide significant financial aid to Ukraine, though they encountered difficulties in utilizing frozen Russian assets for these funds. The EU plans to raise the funds through capital markets instead. The article also touches upon related news, including a Russian strike on Odesa, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's views on peace efforts, and previous meetings between Russian and U.S. officials.
