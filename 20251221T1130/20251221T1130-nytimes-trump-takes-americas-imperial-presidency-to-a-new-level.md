## Article summary
The article "Trump Takes America’s ‘Imperial Presidency’ to a New Level" by Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The Times, argues that President Trump's second term represents a significant escalation of presidential power, surpassing even Richard Nixon's "imperial presidency." Baker details how Trump has embraced royal pageantry, such as elaborate state visits with military flyovers and regal dining arrangements, mirroring European monarchies. This is coupled with an assertion of virtually unbridled power to reshape American government and society, marked by personal aggrandizement, such as plastering his name on public buildings and designating his birthday as a national park holiday, with minimal resistance from Congress or the Supreme Court. The article posits that Trump's approach is a culmination of a 75-year trend of presidents seeking more power, but amplified by his deliberate plan and team of loyalists in his second term, contrasting with his perceived inexperience in the first. While Trump disclaims royal aspirations, his actions and social media posts, including AI-generated images of him as a king, suggest a comfort with the comparison. Supporters view his strong assertion of power as necessary to combat a "woke deep state," while critics deem him narcissistic and a danger to democracy, noting his personal enrichment and tarnished global image. Despite his consistent unpopularity, Trump dominates the political landscape, setting the agenda and compelling his will upon the system. The article also explores how Trump has bypassed traditional limits, drawing parallels to historical presidential overreach during crises but noting Trump's unprecedented scale and lack of apparent concern for limits. His administration's strategy, outlined in the Project 2025 blueprint, relies heavily on executive orders, bypassing congressional negotiation. The piece concludes by questioning whether this enhanced presidential power is a permanent re-wiring of the office or a temporary phase, acknowledging historical precedents of presidential authority being reined in after crises, but admitting the uncertainty of whether this will apply to Trump's tenure.
