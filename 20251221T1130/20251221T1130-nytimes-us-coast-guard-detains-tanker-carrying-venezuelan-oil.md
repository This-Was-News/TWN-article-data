## Article summary
The U.S. Coast Guard boarded the Panamanian-flagged tanker Centuries, which was carrying Venezuelan oil, escalating U.S. pressure on Venezuela. This action follows President Trump's announcement of a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers. The Centuries, however, is not on the publicly maintained U.S. sanctions list, and its cargo reportedly belongs to a Chinese oil trader. The vessel had recently departed Venezuela, and U.S. officials confirmed the boarding, though it was unclear if a seizure warrant was obtained. Venezuela denounced the action as theft and hijacking, claiming the crew was forcibly disappeared. The Centuries loaded a significant amount of crude oil in Venezuela and has a history of transporting Venezuelan oil to China, often using deceptive shipping practices like location spoofing. This incident differs from a previous seizure of the tanker Skipper, which was under U.S. sanctions for carrying Iranian crude. The U.S. Coast Guard is investigating the validity of the Centuries' Panamanian registration.
