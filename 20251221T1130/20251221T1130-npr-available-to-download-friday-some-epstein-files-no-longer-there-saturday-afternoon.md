## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) began releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal investigations on Friday, with more files added to its "Epstein Library" website on Saturday. However, an NPR analysis revealed that over a dozen files initially available on Friday were no longer accessible on Saturday afternoon. These removed files included a photograph of President Trump on a desk and various artworks. The DOJ stated that efforts were made to redact personal information and sensitive materials, but acknowledged that some non-public information might have inadvertently been included due to the volume of data. The department did not immediately comment on why the files were removed. Following the initial release, some members of Congress expressed concerns about missing information and the extent of redactions. Representative Ro Khanna criticized the redactions, stating that powerful individuals involved in Epstein's activities should be held accountable. Representative Thomas Massie echoed these concerns, arguing that the release did not comply with the law and warned of potential future repercussions for the DOJ. While Trump's name and image appear infrequently in the newly released documents, he was a frequent subject in previous Epstein files released by the House Democratic Oversight Committee, often in the context of Epstein's perceived influence on his presidency.
