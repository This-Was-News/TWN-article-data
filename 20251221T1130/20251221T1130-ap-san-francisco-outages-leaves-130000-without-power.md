## Article summary
A massive power outage affected 130,000 homes and businesses in San Francisco on Saturday, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. The outage plunged a significant portion of the northern city into darkness, impacting neighborhoods like Richmond and Presidio, and areas around Golden Gate Park. Social media and local news reported widespread closures of businesses, darkened streetlights, and unlit Christmas decorations. The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management advised residents to avoid nonessential travel due to transit disruptions and treat traffic signals as four-way stops. Some Muni bus and BART train stations were bypassed. A fire at a PG&E substation at 8th and Mission streets was identified as a cause for at least some of the blackouts. PG&E announced later that the power grid had been stabilized, but did not confirm a timeline for power restoration. The outage represented approximately one-third of PG&E's San Francisco customer base.
