## Article summary
U.S. forces have intercepted an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela for the second time in two weeks, escalating President Donald Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. This action follows Trump's recent announcement of a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard, with Defense Department assistance, stopped the tanker, which was last docked in Venezuela. The U.S. stated its intention to continue intercepting oil shipments funding narco-terrorism in the region. Venezuela's government condemned the U.S. actions as criminal and vowed to pursue legal avenues, including complaints to the United Nations Security Council. Trump has intensified his rhetoric, warning Maduro that his time in power is limited and demanding the return of assets seized from U.S. oil companies. This move is partly motivated by disputes over oil investments and accusations of drug trafficking. The U.S. has also been conducting strikes on vessels suspected of smuggling drugs, which have faced scrutiny from lawmakers and human rights activists. The U.S. has deployed a significant naval presence to the region, with Trump indicating that land attacks may follow. Maduro, facing federal charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S., insists the U.S. military operations aim to force him from power.
