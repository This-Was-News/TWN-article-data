## Article summary
The Justice Department has released thousands of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, but at least 16 files disappeared from their public webpage shortly after their release, including a photograph of Donald Trump with Epstein. The government has not provided an explanation for the missing files, fueling public speculation and concern. This incident occurred amidst criticism that the initial document dump offered little new insight into Epstein's crimes or the investigations into his powerful associates. Many anticipated records, such as FBI interviews with survivors and internal memos on charging decisions, were missing or heavily redacted. The released documents did include some new information, like a 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children and details about the decision to abandon a federal investigation in the 2000s. Despite a congressional mandate for full disclosure, the Justice Department plans to release records on a rolling basis, citing the need to obscure identifying information. This approach has frustrated Epstein's accusers and members of Congress seeking transparency. The documents also revealed that federal prosecutors had a strong case against Epstein in 2007 but did not bring federal charges, with one prosecutor citing concerns about jury belief and the nature of the charges. The release has been described as both a triumph and a tragedy, with some feeling the government failed to act sooner to prevent harm.
