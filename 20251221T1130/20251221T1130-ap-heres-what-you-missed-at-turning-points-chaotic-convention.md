## Article summary
Turning Point USA's AmericaFest convention in Phoenix was marked by internal feuds among conservative media figures, with participants like Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Steve Bannon engaging in public spats. These conflicts, which sometimes overshadowed criticism of liberal opponents, highlighted potential divisions within the Republican Party and Donald Trump's coalition. Ben Shapiro directly criticized Candace Owens, Megyn Kelly, and Tucker Carlson, accusing them of moral failings and spreading conspiracy theories. Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, among others, retaliated, with Carlson mocking Shapiro's criticisms and Bannon calling him a 'cancer.' The convention also saw discussions on Israel and antisemitism, with some attendees questioning the Republican Party's unwavering support for Israel and linking it to Trump's 'America First' platform. Erika Kirk, leading Turning Point USA after her husband's assassination, endorsed Vice President JD Vance as the next Republican presidential nominee, leveraging Turning Point's influence in early primary states. The Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, led by Robert F. Kennedy, also had a significant presence, with discussions about potential collaborations and friction with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding environmental regulations.
