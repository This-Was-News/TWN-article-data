## Article summary
President Trump, seeking to appease Cuban American lawmakers and advance his domestic agenda, directed a militarized campaign against Venezuela, driven by overlapping goals of crippling Nicolás Maduro's regime, combating drug cartels, and securing access to Venezuelan oil for U.S. companies. This campaign, spearheaded by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and homeland security adviser Stephen Miller, involved secret directives for maritime strikes against suspected drug boats, resulting in numerous deaths and a quasi-blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers. The strategy also leveraged the Alien Enemies Act for expedited deportations of Venezuelans, a move later curtailed by court rulings. The initiative intensified after negotiations involving Chevron's oil operations, with Mr. Trump ultimately allowing the company to continue its work under revised terms. Behind the scenes, a secret order authorized the Pentagon to target drug-trafficking groups, with a focus on Venezuela, despite bypassing traditional interagency review processes. The campaign has been criticized as potentially constituting war crimes, with the administration asserting intelligence links to drug trafficking, though evidence remains publicly undisclosed. The actions reflect Mr. Rubio's long-held desire to counter leftist governments in Latin America and Mr. Miller's focus on immigration control and striking criminal groups.
