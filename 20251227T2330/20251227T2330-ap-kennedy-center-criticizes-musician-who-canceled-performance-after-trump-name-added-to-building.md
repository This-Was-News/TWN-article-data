## Article summary
The Kennedy Center's president, Richard Grenell, has strongly criticized musician Chuck Redd for canceling a Christmas Eve performance. Redd cited the recent addition of President Donald Trump's name to the venue as the reason for his withdrawal. Grenell described Redd's decision as "classic intolerance" and a "political stunt" that is costly to the non-profit institution. Grenell also stated he would seek $1 million in damages from Redd. Redd, who has hosted holiday Jazz Jams at the Kennedy Center since 2006, expressed sadness over having to cancel the popular tradition. The renaming of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts to include President Trump's name was approved by a Trump-appointed board. This action has drawn criticism, with scholars suggesting it violates a law that prohibits changing the center's memorial status or adding other names to its exterior without congressional approval. Kennedy's niece, Kerry Kennedy, has vowed to remove Trump's name after his term in office.
