## Article summary
Cypriot fishermen are facing a significant challenge due to the proliferation of invasive lionfish in the Mediterranean Sea. These fish, originating from the Red Sea, have no natural predators in the region and are decimating native fish populations, impacting the livelihoods of local fishermen. Warmer sea temperatures, attributed to climate change, are believed to be a primary factor allowing these invasive species to thrive. The silver-cheeked toadfish, another invasive species, also poses a threat, damaging fishing nets and being inedible due to a lethal toxin. To combat this issue, the European Union has implemented compensation schemes, paying fishermen to catch toadfish, which are then incinerated. Additionally, a project called RELIONMED employs divers to cull lionfish. Efforts are also underway to promote lionfish as a culinary delicacy, with a social media campaign, #TasteTheOcean, and the introduction of lionfish on menus in Cypriot tavernas. Despite initial unfamiliarity, lionfish is being presented as a tasty and competitively priced alternative to traditional fish, aiming to turn an ecological problem into an economic opportunity for the fishing sector.
