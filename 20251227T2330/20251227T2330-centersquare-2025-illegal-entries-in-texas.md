## Article summary
In fiscal year 2025, Texas reported 259,878 illegal border crossers apprehended by Border Patrol and CBP officers, excluding gotaways. This figure represents about 10% of the total illegal entries in Texas during 2022 and 2023. Gotaways, defined as individuals who evade capture and do not file immigration claims, are not publicly reported by CBP but were exclusively obtained by The Center Square. At least two million gotaways were reported during the Biden administration, a number potentially higher due to various factors. Many of these gotaways are known to have criminal records, including some on terrorist watchlists and identified as Special Interest Aliens (SIAs), posing a national security risk. In fiscal years 2022 and 2023 combined, illegal entries in Texas totaled 1.4 million, with hundreds of thousands of gotaways each year. In fiscal 2023 alone, nearly 450,000 gotaways were reported in Texas, accounting for nearly 60% of the total known gotaways at the southwest border that year. Historically, the Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley sectors saw the most activity, but El Paso topped the charts in fiscal 2023, with gotaways nearly equaling apprehensions in the El Paso and Del Rio sectors. Texas's Operation Lone Star continues to arrest gotaways, smugglers, and other criminals, with roughly 100 criminal arrests made weekly. These operations have identified thousands of foreign nationals with active felony warrants, including SIAs primarily from countries of concern.
