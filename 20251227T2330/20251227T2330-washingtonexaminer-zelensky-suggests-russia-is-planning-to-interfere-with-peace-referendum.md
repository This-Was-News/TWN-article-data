## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that Russia is allegedly planning to interfere with a potential referendum on President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan. Zelensky's assertion, based on intelligence from Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service, suggests Russia intends to allow Ukrainian citizens in Russia and occupied territories to vote, aiming to later delegitimize future Ukrainian elections. This revelation follows Zelensky's indication to Axios that he would hold a national referendum on the peace framework if Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire. The prospect of such a referendum is contingent on Zelenskys upcoming meeting with Trump to finalize the peace plan and ceasefire timeline. Key sticking points in the peace process include Ukraine's refusal of territorial concessions to Russia and its demand for significant security guarantees from the United States. Meanwhile, Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine early Saturday morning, targeting Kyiv's energy facilities and civilian infrastructure, which Zelensky views as a direct response to the peace negotiations. He emphasized the critical need for strong security guarantees and additional air defense systems to protect Ukraine, especially if a referendum proceeds, ensuring safe skies and the presence of observers.
