## Article summary
Myanmar's military rulers are conducting phased general elections from late December to late January, aiming to restore stability and end international isolation following their 2021 coup. These elections are widely criticized as a "sham" due to the ongoing civil war, widespread human rights abuses by the military, and the suppression of dissent. The United Nations Secretary General has stated that the conditions for free and fair elections are absent. The military has enacted a law against "interference" in the election process, leading to the detention of nearly 100 individuals, some for social media activity critical of the vote. The main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), is banned, and its leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, are imprisoned. Western governments have refused to send observers, believing the military intends to create a parliament dominated by its proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). Neighboring China supports the election, viewing the military as a "necessary evil" to protect its economic and geopolitical interests in the region, even pressuring ethnic armed groups to cede territory. Factors contributing to the military's perceived advantage include improved organization, drone usage, and the fragmentation and fatigue within opposition groups. Despite setbacks and a lack of clear direction from the opposition's shadow government, some remain committed to toppling the military, viewing the current situation as an existential fight for the country's future.
