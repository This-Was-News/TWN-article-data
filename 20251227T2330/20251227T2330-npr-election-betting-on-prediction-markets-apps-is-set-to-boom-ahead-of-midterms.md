## Article summary
Online prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi, once under intense scrutiny by the Biden administration, are now experiencing a resurgence under the Trump administration, raising concerns about election interference. During the Biden years, regulators aggressively clamped down on these apps, even pursuing legal actions to ban bets on election outcomes and forcing Polymarket to cease U.S. operations. However, the Trump administration has reversed this stance, with Donald Trump Jr. joining Kalshi as a strategic adviser, signaling a more favorable environment for the industry. Kalshi, in particular, is experiencing significant growth, with its valuation doubling and attracting billions in investment. The apps allow users to bet on various real-world events, including election results, with the claim that the 'wisdom of the crowd' can predict outcomes. Critics, however, warn that this practice could undermine election integrity, potentially encouraging wealthy donors to manipulate candidate odds and influence voter behavior. Experts also express concern about the possibility of insider trading and foreign actors manipulating market outcomes. Despite these warnings, prediction markets are processing billions of dollars in bets weekly, with platforms like DraftKings, Coinbase, and Robinhood also entering the space. While Kalshi argues its product is different from gambling and that markets are moved by informed traders, legal challenges and state-level actions continue to question its operations.
