## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case Trump v. Barbara in 2026, challenging President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship for children born after February 19, 2025, to parents who are in the U.S. illegally or are temporary residents. This case hinges on the interpretation of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" within the 14th Amendment. Legal experts Michael Ramsey and Ilan Wurman offer differing perspectives on this clause. Ramsey argues that even individuals unlawfully present are subject to U.S. laws, thus qualifying their children for citizenship. Wurman contends that parental status and allegiance to the sovereign nation are paramount, drawing parallels to English common law where protection under the sovereign was a prerequisite for citizenship. He suggests that those entering unlawfully may not be considered under the nation's protection. The court's decision could significantly redefine the application of the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship.
