## Article summary
A Nashville-based speaker company, Auratone, known for its legendary 5C Super Sound Cube used by artists like Michael Jackson and Taylor Swift, is planning to move its production overseas. This decision comes as a direct response to the unpredictable and escalating tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which have made it difficult for the 66-year-old family-owned business to operate and plan for the future. Alex Jacobsen, the company's president and owner, stated that over 60% of his clients are international, and moving production abroad will significantly reduce his exposure to these tariffs. Jacobsen cited a $4,000 bill he incurred due to tariffs on imported parts as an example of the financial strain. The constant changes in tariff policies, sometimes occurring daily, have created an environment of uncertainty, hindering business operations and financial planning. Auratone, with annual sales of approximately $400,000 and two part-time employees, is not alone in its struggles; the article highlights a broader issue of tariffs impacting small businesses. The company's move is seen as a consequence of policies intended to encourage domestic manufacturing, rather than a "re-shoring" movement. Jacobsen has also become involved in a legal challenge against the unilateral imposition of tariffs, arguing for more due process and congressional input. He hopes a pending Supreme Court ruling on the legality of these tariffs will bring much-needed stability to the business environment.
