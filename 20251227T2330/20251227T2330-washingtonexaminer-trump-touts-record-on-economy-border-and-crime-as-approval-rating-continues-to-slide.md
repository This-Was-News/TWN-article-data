## Article summary
President Donald Trump has recently highlighted his administration's achievements in the economy, border security, and crime reduction, despite facing low approval ratings. He asserted on social media that his policies, including tariffs, have led to significant economic growth, citing a 4.3% GDP increase and a cut in the trade deficit. Trump also claimed there is no inflation, though official reports indicate a 2.7% inflation rate. While the economy shows growth, unemployment and living costs remain concerns for Americans, and public opinion on the economy is largely negative, with inflation being his weakest issue. Conversely, Trump's approval is higher regarding immigration and national security. He pointed to a historic low national murder rate and successful border operations, stating that most illegal immigrants apprehended were criminals. The report also confirms that the number of people working in the U.S. has reached a record high.
