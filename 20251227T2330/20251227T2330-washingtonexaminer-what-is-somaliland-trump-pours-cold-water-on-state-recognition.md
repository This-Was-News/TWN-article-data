## Article summary
President Donald Trump has indicated he is not ready to recognize Somaliland as an independent state, despite Israel becoming the first UN member to establish diplomatic relations with the breakaway republic. Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 after a civil war and has operated a de facto government for over 30 years without international recognition. The agreement between Israel and Somaliland includes collaboration in various sectors and paves the way for diplomatic representation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu framed this recognition within the spirit of the Abraham Accords, an agreement brokered by Trump. However, Trump stated that his meeting with Netanyahu would prioritize other issues, though his administration would review the potential recognition. This stance contrasts with some in Congress who support recognizing Somaliland due to its democratic record and strategic location. Somalia strongly opposes Israel's decision, viewing it as a threat to its sovereignty and a potential destabilizing factor in the Horn of Africa. The African Union also rejected Israel's move, asserting that Somaliland remains part of Somalia, while the European Union supports dialogue between the two entities.
