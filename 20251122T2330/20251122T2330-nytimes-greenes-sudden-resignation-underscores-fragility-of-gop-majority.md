## Article summary
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's unexpected resignation deals a blow to the Republican Party's slim majority in Congress, leaving a vacant seat until at least spring. Her departure highlights deep discontent within the far-right wing of President Trump's coalition, potentially complicating Speaker Mike Johnson's efforts to manage the party heading into crucial midterm elections. Greene criticized the Republican Congress for failing to enact significant ultraconservative policies, a sentiment echoed by other far-right lawmakers like Representatives Victoria Spartz and Thomas Massie. Despite Donald Trump celebrating her exit and calling her a traitor, her resignation also signals dissatisfaction within his base. While her departure won't immediately alter the House's balance of power, it creates an immediate vacancy and underscores internal party divisions. Other Republicans, like Speaker Johnson's office, downplayed the impact, focusing on upcoming elections to strengthen their hold on the House. The situation suggests a complex dynamic for Republican leadership as they navigate internal dissent and upcoming electoral challenges.
