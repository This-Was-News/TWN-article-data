## Article summary
President Donald Trump has presented a new 28-point plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine, asserting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lacks the leverage for continued battlefield success and must accept a settlement heavily favoring Moscow. Trump expects Zelenskyy to respond to the plan by next Thursday, stating that the Ukrainian leader will have to approve it. Zelenskyy, facing domestic corruption scandals and battlefield setbacks, has indicated that Ukraine may have to choose between defending its sovereign rights and maintaining crucial American support. Trump and Zelenskyy have a contentious history, including Trump's first impeachment stemming from a 2019 phone call pressuring Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden. Trump's proposal includes demands for Ukraine to cede its eastern Donbas region, significantly reduce its army, and for Europe to guarantee Ukraine will never join NATO. This plan has been formally presented to Zelenskyy in Kyiv. While the U.S. Army secretary's team perceived the proposal as a starting point for negotiations, Trump's patience remains a question, with him having previously told Zelenskyy, "You don't have the cards." The pressure on Zelenskyy intensifies as he deals with a kickback scandal and signs of strain on the Ukrainian battlefield. The proposal also contains elements that could deeply offend Ukrainian pride, such as demanding the rejection of all Nazi ideology, which could be seen as validating Russia's justifications for the invasion.
