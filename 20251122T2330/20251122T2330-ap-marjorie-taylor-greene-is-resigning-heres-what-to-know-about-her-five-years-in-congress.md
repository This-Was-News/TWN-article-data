## Article summary
Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has announced her resignation from Congress, effective January 5, 2026. Her five-year tenure has been marked by controversy and a rapid ascent from an outsider to a figure within the Republican party. Greene's political involvement began during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, where she gained attention for promoting conspiracy theories online, including claims related to 9/11 and the QAnon movement. She was elected to Congress in 2020 in Georgia's 14th District. Early in her term, the Democratic-led House removed her from committee assignments due to her rhetoric. However, she regained committee roles after Republicans took the House majority in 2022 and became an advisor to then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Greene was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, but their relationship soured as she took positions contrary to his, including criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza and support for releasing Jeffrey Epstein files. Trump eventually called her a traitor, and shortly after, she announced her resignation.
