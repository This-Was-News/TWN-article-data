## Article summary
President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claim to prioritize "gold standard" science in government decisions. However, scientists and experts argue that their actions often contradict this principle, relying instead on preliminary or fringe research, hunches, or unsubstantiated claims. A recent example cited is the CDC website's alteration to question the scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause autism. Experts express concern that this approach shifts from evidence-based decision-making to decision-based evidence-making. This pattern has also been observed in Trump's past medical advice and Kennedy's questioning of established vaccine protocols. The article explains that "gold standard" science typically involves rigorous, transparent methods like randomized clinical trials and peer-reviewed research. It highlights the importance of real-world evidence and the limitations of anecdotes and single studies. The piece also provides guidance on how to critically evaluate research claims by asking key questions about the source, methodology, and potential biases. The scientific process itself is characterized by reducing uncertainty rather than achieving absolute certainty.
