## Article summary
In contrast to past political norms, several Democratic figures are openly acknowledging their 2028 presidential ambitions. This shift away from coy behavior is attributed to the wide-open nature of the potential field and a voter demand for authenticity. Senators like Cory Booker and governors like Gavin Newsom have publicly stated they are considering a run, breaking from the tradition of deflecting such questions. This transparency is seen by some strategists as a necessary approach in the current political climate, where voters are turned off by traditional politician-speak. The Democratic primary is anticipated to be lengthy and competitive, encouraging candidates to start building visibility early. However, not all potential candidates are adopting this open stance, with some, like Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, still playing coy. There are also risks associated with these early declarations, including potential backlash from opponents and the need to balance national ambitions with current state responsibilities. Strategists advise candidates to be mindful of their messaging and to demonstrate support for party efforts, akin to a "Beyonce-Taylor Swift strategy" of helping local economies.
