## Article summary
Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia congresswoman known for her strong support of Donald Trump, has announced she will vacate her office a year before her term expires. This unexpected move has surprised many, including her close associates. Greene stated her decision stems from disillusionment with the current political climate, though few believe it's not a strategic political maneuver. Her political isolation has grown, with feelings of betrayal by Trump, disgust with her own party, and no allies among Democrats. Trump himself recently criticized Greene, calling her "Marjorie Traitor Greene" and threatening a primary challenger, which left her feeling blindsided. The congresswoman arrived in Washington as a fervent Trump supporter but now appears to have lost her appetite for political battles, leading to her current political exile.
