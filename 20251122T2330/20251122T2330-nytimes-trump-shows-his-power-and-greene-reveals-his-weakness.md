## Article summary
Marjorie Taylor Greene's unexpected resignation from Congress signals growing divisions within the Republican Party and the broader Trump movement. Despite her past loyalty, Greene has emerged as a vocal critic of President Trump, positioning herself as the true MAGA champion and highlighting policy and political disagreements. Her departure suggests that Trump's influence, though still formidable, is facing challenges from within his own party as Republicans grapple with their identity in a post-Trump era. This internal conflict is manifesting in debates over foreign policy, economic issues, immigration, and the acceptable boundaries of political discourse. Younger conservatives, like Vivek Ramaswamy, are also beginning to articulate visions for the party's future that extend beyond Trump's direct influence. Other prominent figures, including Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, are engaged in ideological feuds, further illustrating the party's fragmentation. Potential 2028 presidential candidates, such as JD Vance and Ted Cruz, are navigating these internal debates cautiously, seeking to position themselves for a future that may not be dominated by Trump. Even Democrats acknowledge this shift, seeing a more fluid potential field of Republican candidates. While Trump maintains his strong hold on his base, the ongoing discussions and disagreements indicate a significant internal struggle for the soul of the Republican Party, questioning what it will mean to be a Republican without his direct leadership.
