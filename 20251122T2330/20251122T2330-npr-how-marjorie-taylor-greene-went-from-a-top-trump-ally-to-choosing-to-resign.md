## Article summary
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch supporter of President Trump, has announced her resignation from Congress effective in January, citing a growing rift with the president. This decision comes after a public disagreement over the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, during which Trump referred to Greene as "Marjorie Traitor Greene." Greene defended her actions, stating she was standing up for victims and that the president's reaction was unwarranted. The split between Greene and Trump has been widening over the past year, with Greene criticizing some of Trump's policies and decisions. This evolution in her political stance has led some to question "What happened to Marjorie?" with speculation ranging from a genuine change of heart to strategic maneuvering for future political ambitions. While Greene asserts she remains true to her constituents, political observers note her shift in style, though core principles like "America First" may persist. The impact of her resignation on her district and the broader Republican party remains to be seen, as voters grapple with her changing public persona and the future of the "America First" movement without Trump's direct leadership. Her surprise resignation adds another layer of unpredictability to her political career and the ongoing discussions within the Republican party about its future direction.
