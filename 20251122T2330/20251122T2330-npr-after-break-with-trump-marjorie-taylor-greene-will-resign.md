## Article summary
Republican Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday that she will resign from Congress effective January 5, 2026. Greene, an "America First" conservative, cited clashes with President Trump and the Republican Party leadership as a primary reason for her departure. In a video statement, she criticized the Republican Party and House leadership, stating that "all courage leaves" during campaign season. The decision follows months of disagreements with Trump, particularly concerning his agenda and the release of the Epstein files. Greene expressed her disappointment, stating that defending victims should not lead to being called a traitor by the President. She also felt it would be unfair to her constituents to face a primary challenge from Trump while the Republican Party faces potential midterm losses. Greene described the political landscape as "absurd and completely unserious," refusing to remain in a "battered wife" situation. Her resignation adds to a record number of lawmakers not seeking re-election in 2026. Greene has consistently argued that Trump and the Republican Party have deviated from the Make America Great Again and America First vision. Her announcement comes amid setbacks for the Republican Party and Trump, highlighting a growing fracture within the MAGA coalition.
