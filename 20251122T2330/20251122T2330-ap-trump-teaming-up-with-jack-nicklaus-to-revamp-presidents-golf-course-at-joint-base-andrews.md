## Article summary
President Donald Trump has announced a partnership with legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus to renovate the golf courses at Joint Base Andrews. Trump described the base's facilities as being in "very bad shape" due to a lack of maintenance and expressed his intention to restore them. He stated that Nicklaus will serve as the architect for the redesigns, focusing on at least two of the existing courses. This initiative adds to Trump's list of construction and renovation projects, which include work on the White House East Wing, the Rose Garden, and plans for a new arch near the Lincoln Memorial. While Trump has golfed at Andrews, he typically prefers playing at his private properties. Nicklaus, a highly decorated golfer, has designed numerous courses worldwide through his firm, Nicklaus Design. The article raises questions about the funding and cost of these renovations, as well as who will pay for improvements to the military property. The White House has not provided further details on these matters. The potential redesign at Andrews follows other significant alterations Trump has commissioned at the White House, such as the demolition of the East Wing for a new ballroom and changes to the interior spaces. Trump's business has previously had ties to courses designed by Nicklaus, though the Trump Organization sold its operating rights to one such course in 2023.
