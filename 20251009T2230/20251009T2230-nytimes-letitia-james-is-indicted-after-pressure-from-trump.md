## Article summary
New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted on bank fraud and false statement charges related to her purchase of a property in Norfolk, Virginia. The indictment was secured by a prosecutor handpicked by President Trump, Lindsey Halligan, who has no prosecutorial experience. The case against James, a Democrat who has been a vocal opponent of Trump, has been criticized as politically motivated. Career prosecutors had previously found insufficient evidence to bring charges, but Halligan, installed by Trump, pursued the case. James has denied the allegations, calling them baseless. The indictment comes amid Trump's broader campaign against his perceived rivals, including former FBI Director James Comey, who was also recently indicted. Democrats have condemned the indictment as an abuse of the criminal justice system, with some comparing it to authoritarian tactics. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has moved forward with a $20 billion bailout of Argentina, drawing criticism for potentially benefiting wealthy investors with ties to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The bailout is intended to support Argentine President Javier Milei, a close ally of Trump, but has raised concerns about its impact on American farmers and the U.S. economy.
