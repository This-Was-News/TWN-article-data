## Article summary
The document is an indictment filed in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, against Letitia A. James. The indictment charges James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James is accused of obtaining a mortgage loan for a property in Norfolk, Virginia, by falsely representing it as her secondary residence when, in reality, she used it as an investment property. This misrepresentation allowed her to secure favorable loan terms, including a lower interest rate and a higher seller credit, resulting in approximately $18,933 in ill-gotten gains over the life of the loan. The indictment details how James filled out loan applications and insurance forms falsely, claiming the property was her secondary residence. She also filed tax forms treating the property as rental real estate, further contradicting her initial representations. The loan was originated by OVM Financial, a mortgage lending business, and later acquired by First Savings Bank. The indictment seeks forfeiture of the proceeds obtained from the fraudulent activities, including a money judgment of $18,933. The case is being prosecuted in the Eastern District of Virginia.
