## Article summary
New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted on a fraud charge related to a mortgage fraud investigation, marking the latest move by President Donald Trump's administration to use the Justice Department against political adversaries. James, who previously won a significant judgment against Trump for alleged fraud, denies any wrongdoing. The indictment comes amid broader political tensions, with Democrats accusing Trump of weaponizing the Justice Department. Meanwhile, the U.S. is sending troops to Israel to support a ceasefire deal in Gaza, and Trump's administration faces criticism for deploying National Guard troops in U.S. cities. The government shutdown continues, causing delays and financial strain for military families and air traffic controllers. Additionally, Trump's administration has imposed sanctions on entities involved in Iranian oil shipments, and political tensions persist over the handling of the shutdown and other domestic issues.
