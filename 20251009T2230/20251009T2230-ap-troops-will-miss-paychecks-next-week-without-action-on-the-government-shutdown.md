## Article summary
The government shutdown is causing significant financial strain on military families, as troops may miss their next paycheck without congressional action. Heather Campbell, whose husband is an Air Force officer, faces the prospect of using credit cards to cover expenses, highlighting the broken trust among service members. The shutdown is the third in 12 years, raising anxiety levels among military families who often live paycheck to paycheck. While Congress has previously ensured troops receive back pay, time is running out to prevent missed paychecks. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Donald Trump have indicated support for paying troops, but legislative action is uncertain. Rep. Jen Kiggans introduced a bipartisan measure to maintain military and Coast Guard salaries. The economic impact of the shutdown extends to regions with large military populations, affecting spending and local economies. Military families rely on nonprofits and charities for support, but many lack substantial emergency funds. The shutdown also threatens essential programs like WIC, which supports low-income mothers and children. The Pentagon's contingency plan prioritizes military operations and child care activities, but the financial uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on service members and their families.
