## Article summary
Dominion Voting Systems, which was falsely accused of rigging the 2020 election, has been acquired by Liberty Vote. The acquisition was announced in a press release, stating that Dominion is no longer operational and Liberty Vote now owns and controls it. Dominion's website now redirects to Liberty Vote's site. The false claims against Dominion led to legal actions, including a nearly $800 million defamation settlement with Fox News. Liberty Vote's acquisition is framed as a move to improve election integrity, aligning with conservative priorities. The new company aims to leverage hand-marked paper ballots, complying with President Trump's executive order on voting. Most U.S. voters already use hand-marked paper ballots. The new company is founded by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican election director. Trump's executive order on voting has faced legal challenges and been halted by federal judges.
