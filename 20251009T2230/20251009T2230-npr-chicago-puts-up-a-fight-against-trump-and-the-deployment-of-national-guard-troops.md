## Article summary
Hundreds of people marched in downtown Chicago on October 8 to protest President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and the presence of immigration enforcement agents. Chicago resident Eric Harvey expressed his frustration, calling the deployment a publicity stunt, especially given the city's low homicide rate. Trump has labeled Chicago a 'war zone' and claims the city's crime rate is unsustainable. National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas are tasked with protecting federal employees and property. Harvey criticized Trump's actions, which have led to increased ICE raids in his neighborhood. The Trump administration's 'Operation Midway Blitz' has resulted in over 1,000 arrests of undocumented migrants. Chicago residents have organized to document and resist ICE activities. Jessica Urbina, a 26-year-old college student, joined the protest to stand against Trump's actions. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson vowed to resist Trump's policies, calling them an attack on democracy. Federal judges are hearing arguments on the legality of the National Guard deployment. The increased federal presence has caused fear among immigrants, with many, like Venezuelan migrant Jackson, living in constant anxiety about potential ICE encounters.
