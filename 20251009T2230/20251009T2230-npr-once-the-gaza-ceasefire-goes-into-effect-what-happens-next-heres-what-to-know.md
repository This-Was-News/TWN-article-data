## Article summary
Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump to end the conflict in Gaza. The plan begins with a ceasefire, pending approval by Israel's Cabinet. President Trump plans to visit the region for an official signing. However, challenges remain, including debates over the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released and the future governance of Gaza. The plan involves complex negotiations on issues like the fate of Hamas and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Controversies surround the proposed 'Board of Peace,' which includes former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Implementing any peace agreement will be difficult due to the extensive destruction in Gaza and the traumatized population. The success of the plan hinges on both sides agreeing to the terms and applying them in a war-torn region.
