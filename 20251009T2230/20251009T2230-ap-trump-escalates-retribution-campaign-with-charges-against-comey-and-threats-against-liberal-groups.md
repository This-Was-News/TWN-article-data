## Article summary
President Donald Trump has intensified his campaign against political adversaries, with the Justice Department indicting former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress. Trump also directed his administration to target supporters of left-wing terrorism, accusing Democrat-aligned groups of financing violent protests without evidence. Critics argue this represents an unprecedented abuse of power, with Trump using presidential authority to retaliate against critics. Sen. Mark Warner condemned the interference, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based prosecutions. Trump denied retaliatory motives, framing his actions as justice. Additionally, Trump has pressured prosecutors to investigate figures like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, while revoking security clearances and protections for various officials and institutions. The Comey indictment followed public pressure from Trump, despite prosecutors' internal concerns about the case's viability.
