## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV met with Chicago union leaders, urging them to advocate for immigrants and welcome minorities. He acknowledged the need for safety policies but emphasized respecting human dignity. The meeting occurred amid increased immigration crackdowns in Chicago, with National Guard troops deployed to protect federal properties. Cardinal Blase Cupich, who accompanied the labor leaders, noted that Leo was well-informed about the situation. Cupich expected immigration to be a top agenda item at the upcoming U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops meeting. Catholic leaders have criticized the Trump administration's immigration policies, which have separated families and caused fear. Leo encouraged U.S. bishops to speak with one voice on immigration issues. Cupich was encouraged by Leo's recent remarks defending his decision to honor Senator Dick Durbin for his work with immigrants. The meeting followed another with El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz, who brought letters from immigrant families. Cupich was also in Rome to accompany Chicago schoolchildren who met Leo after their mock conclave went viral.
