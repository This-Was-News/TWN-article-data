## Article summary
László Krasznahorkai, a 71-year-old Hungarian writer, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in literature. Known for his postmodern and apocalyptic works, Krasznahorkai's notable novels include *Satantango* and *The Melancholy of Resistance*. The Nobel Committee honored him for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that reaffirms the power of art amidst apocalyptic terror. Krasznahorkai expressed gratitude for the award, emphasizing that literature exists beyond non-literary expectations and is still being read. His first novel, *Satantango*, published in 1985, tells the story of swindlers and an abandoned collective farm, later adapted into a seven-hour film. *The Melancholy of Resistance* features a ghostly circus and a giant, dead stuffed whale. Krasznahorkai believes literature offers hope and the existence of beauty and nobility. The Nobel Prize, worth $1.2 million, has been awarded since 1901 to notable figures like Doris Lessing, Bob Dylan, Alice Munro, and Derek Walcott.
