## Article summary
A Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a tradition spanning over two decades, has been canceled. Musician Chuck Redd, the host, cited the addition of President Donald Trump's name to the building's facade as the reason for the cancellation. The building now reads "The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts." According to the White House, Trump's appointed board approved the name change, a move scholars argue violates federal law. Congress originally established the center as a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy, with a law prohibiting its use as a memorial to anyone else or the placement of another name on its exterior. Kennedy's niece, Kerry Kennedy, has pledged to have Trump's name removed after he leaves office. Legal experts suggest that any changes would require congressional approval. Trump has been actively involved with the center since returning to office, replacing leadership and heading the board. This action is seen as part of his broader effort to counter "woke culture" in federal cultural institutions. Several artists have previously canceled performances at the Kennedy Center following Trump's return to office.
