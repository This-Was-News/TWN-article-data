## Article summary
The Justice Department has announced it may require several more weeks to fully release documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, citing the recent discovery of over a million potentially relevant files. This announcement follows a missed congressionally mandated deadline and comes amid calls from a dozen U.S. senators for an audit of the department's handling of the case. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the FBI uncovered the additional documents, a development that surprised many given previous assurances of a comprehensive review. The Justice Department stated its lawyers are working diligently to review and redact sensitive information from these newly found records, as required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act. This law mandates the release of files on Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The staggered release of documents so far has drawn criticism for being heavily redacted and lacking context. Some released documents include transcripts of grand jury testimony and notes indicating former President Trump flew on Epstein's private plane more frequently than previously known. Senators have expressed concern over the delay and the redactions, emphasizing the need for full transparency to identify those who enabled Epstein's crimes. The White House has defended the Justice Department's efforts in managing the release of these sensitive records.
