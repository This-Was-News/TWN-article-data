## Article summary
The latest release of files concerning Jeffrey Epstein includes hundreds of references to President Trump, with two subpoenas sent to his Mar-a-Lago residence. The nearly 30,000 documents also contain versions of Epstein's will, Ghislaine Maxwell's tax returns, and internal communications from the jail where Epstein died. While Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing, some documents contain claims the Justice Department deems false. The files detail Trump's past travel on Epstein's private jet and include letters suggesting Prince Andrew sought "inappropriate friends." Epstein's will named figures like Jimmy Cayne and James Staley as executors, with Larry Summers listed as a backup. Federal agents attempted to contact about ten potential co-conspirators, including Leslie Wexner and Jean-Luc Brunel. Trump administration officials dismissed claims against the president in the documents as untrue and sensationalist, particularly those submitted before the 2020 election.
