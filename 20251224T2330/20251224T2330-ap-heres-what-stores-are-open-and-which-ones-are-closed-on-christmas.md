However, some chains like Walgreens and 7-Eleven will have locations open, with hours varying by store. Many CVS and Starbucks locations will operate with modified hours, and customers are advised to check local listings. McDonald's also typically has many locations open on holidays, with hours varying. Grocery stores like Kroger and Safeway will have a mix of closures and adjusted hours.
