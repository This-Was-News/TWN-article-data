## Article summary
An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, Victor Mojica, was placed on administrative leave after being caught on video roughly pushing a woman at an immigration court in New York. The incident, which occurred in September 2025, was widely circulated and condemned by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). However, Mojica was reinstated to active duty just days later, before the DHS Office of Inspector General had concluded its review of his behavior. The Inspector General's office ultimately decided not to pursue a criminal probe nearly two months after the incident. This rapid reinstatement and lack of transparency have raised concerns about DHS oversight mechanisms and disciplinary practices. Critics worry this incident is indicative of a larger systemic issue where law enforcement is becoming politicized. DHS has not provided detailed explanations regarding its investigation process or Mojica's swift return to duty. While DHS stated that allegations of excessive force are reviewed through internal mechanisms, they declined to litigate personnel matters publicly. Some former ICE officials suggest that if the matter was not criminal, a quick reinstatement might be standard, especially given the agency's push for increased deportations. However, the lack of public explanation for Mojica's reinstatement has led to a loss of trust and professionalism in ICE, according to some former employees.
