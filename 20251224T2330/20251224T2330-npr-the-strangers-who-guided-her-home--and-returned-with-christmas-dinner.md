## Article summary
In 1989, Mary Klein, new to Phoenix and alone, got lost on Christmas Eve while trying to find her way home. A kind couple stopped to help, with the woman accompanying Klein in her car while the man followed, guiding her across town. They ensured she was safe at home before leaving. The next day, the same couple returned with a picnic basket full of food and shared their Christmas dinner with Klein. They spent the afternoon together, and the couple even helped with the cleanup. This act of profound kindness from strangers deeply touched Klein. Nearly 40 years later, inspired by their generosity, Klein actively seeks opportunities to connect with and help others who might be spending holidays alone, emphasizing the significant impact this experience had on her life.
