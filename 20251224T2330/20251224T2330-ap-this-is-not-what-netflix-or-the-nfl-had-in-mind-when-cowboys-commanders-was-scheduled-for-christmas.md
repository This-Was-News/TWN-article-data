## Article summary
The Christmas Day NFL game between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Commanders was anticipated to be a high-stakes matchup featuring star quarterbacks Dak Prescott and Jayden Daniels. However, both teams have underperformed significantly, with the Commanders eliminated from playoff contention and the Cowboys facing a second consecutive year missing the postseason. Quarterback Jayden Daniels of the Commanders has been sidelined due to injuries, limiting his appearances and impacting the team's performance. The Commanders have struggled, losing nine of their last ten games, while the Cowboys, despite strong individual offensive statistics from Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, and George Pickens, have also failed to secure a playoff spot. The Cowboys' offensive line has seen a shuffle, with Tyler Smith moving back to left tackle. Both teams' defensive coordinators, Matt Eberflus for Dallas and Joe Whitt Jr. for Washington, may be facing job changes due to their units' struggles. The disappointing season for both franchises means the Christmas Day game will not have the playoff implications originally envisioned by the NFL and Netflix.
