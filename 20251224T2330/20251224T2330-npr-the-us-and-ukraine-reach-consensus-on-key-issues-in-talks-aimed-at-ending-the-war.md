## Article summary
The United States and Ukraine have reached a consensus on key issues to end the ongoing conflict, though disagreements persist regarding territorial control in eastern Ukraine and the management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented a 20-point plan, developed after intensive talks, to Russian negotiators, with a response anticipated soon. A primary point of contention is the Donbas region, with Ukraine insisting on a referendum for self-determination and the demilitarization of the area, while Russia demands Ukraine relinquish remaining territory. The U.S. has proposed transforming these disputed areas into free economic zones to facilitate compromise. Another significant unresolved issue is the management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, currently under Russian occupation. While the U.S. suggests a consortium with equal stakes for Ukraine and Russia, Ukraine proposes a joint venture with the U.S., granting American partners discretion in distributing their share. The agreement also includes provisions for strong security guarantees for Ukraine, mirroring NATO's Article 5, to be detailed in a separate bilateral document with the U.S. Additionally, the draft proposes accelerating a free trade agreement between Ukraine and the U.S., and outlines economic recovery plans, including a substantial global development package for reconstruction and investment in various industries. Ukraine is also seeking the release of all prisoners since 2014 and the return of civilian detainees, political prisoners, and children.
