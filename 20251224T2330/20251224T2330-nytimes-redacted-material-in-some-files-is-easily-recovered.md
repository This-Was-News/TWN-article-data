## Article summary
Portions of Jeffrey Epstein's investigation files, released by the Justice Department, were not properly redacted digitally, allowing sensitive information to be recovered by copying and pasting. The New York Times discovered that some censored material could be easily revealed, suggesting hasty redactions. While these recovered details did not shed new light on President Trump's ties to Epstein, they offered further insight into Epstein's methods of abuse and financial concealment. One instance involved revealing that an executor of Epstein's estate, Darren K. Indyke, signed a check from Epstein's foundation to an immigration lawyer involved in arranging forced marriages for Epstein's victims. A Justice Department spokesman stated that the failed redactions were applied by parties in the civil litigation, and the department merely reproduced the materials. This follows earlier reports by The Guardian about undone redactions. President Trump recently signed a bill mandating the release of all Epstein investigation files, emphasizing transparency and prohibiting redactions based on embarrassment or political sensitivity, with exceptions only for protecting victims' personal information. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche affirmed that only legally required redactions are being applied to these documents.
