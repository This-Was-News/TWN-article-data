## Article summary
The Trump administration has entered into an agreement with Palau, a Pacific nation, to accept up to 75 third-country nationals who cannot be returned to their home countries. In exchange, Palau will receive $7.5 million and other aid, which is intended to help address labor shortages. This development occurs as the administration intensifies efforts to deport individuals to countries where they have no connections. Meanwhile, the Justice Department announced it has found over a million more documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, delaying the full release of information. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the department for withholding these documents. Separately, a man suspected of shooting two National Guard members in Washington faces federal firearm charges that could carry the death penalty. The Supreme Court has refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, ruling that the term "regular forces" in a relevant law likely refers to the U.S. military, not civilian law enforcement. This decision could impact future presidential efforts to use the military domestically. The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford is in its seventh month of deployment in the Caribbean, a prolonged mission that began as part of President Trump's pressure campaign on Venezuela. The extended deployment raises concerns about crew morale and maintenance costs. In another legal setback for the administration, a federal judge ruled that FEMA funds cannot be withheld from states that do not subtract deportees from population counts for grant allocation. Lastly, approximately 350 National Guard troops are set to arrive in New Orleans to assist with security, a deployment that highlights the administration's focus on crime and immigration in Democratic-led cities.
