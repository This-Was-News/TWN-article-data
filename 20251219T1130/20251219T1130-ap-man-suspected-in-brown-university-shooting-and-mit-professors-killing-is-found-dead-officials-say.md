## Article summary
The man suspected of fatally shooting two students at Brown University and killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor has been found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Claudio Neves Valente, 48, a former Brown student and Portuguese national, was discovered in a New Hampshire storage facility. Authorities believe Valente is responsible for the Brown University shooting last Saturday, which left two students dead and nine injured, and the killing of MIT professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro two days later. Valente and Loureiro had previously attended the same academic program in Portugal. Valente had come to the U.S. on a student visa and later obtained legal permanent residence status. President Donald Trump announced the suspension of the green card lottery program following the revelation of Valente's immigration status. The motive behind the shootings remains unknown. A crucial tip from a witness who encountered Valente and posted suspicions on Reddit led investigators to his location. The victims included Brown sophomores Ella Cook and freshman Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, and MIT physicist Nuno F.G. Loureiro. Three of the wounded students have been released, while six remain in stable condition.
