## Article summary
Federal prosecutors in Massachusetts have connected the killings of two Brown University students and an M.I.T. professor to Claudio Neves Valente, a 48-year-old man found dead in a New Hampshire storage unit. Valente died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a manhunt. He is believed to have known the M.I.T. professor, Nuno F.G. Loureiro, from their time in the same academic program in Portugal. The motive for the shooting at Brown University, where Valente was briefly enrolled in a graduate physics program, remains unclear. Authorities stated there was no indication Valente knew the two Brown students, Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, who were killed. The suspect was identified through an anonymous tip on Reddit about a suspicious vehicle, which matched a report from a Brown faculty member. Investigators traced the rental car to Valente, who had taken steps to conceal his movements, including switching license plates and using multiple SIM cards.
