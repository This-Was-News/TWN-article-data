## Article summary
The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is set to be renamed the 'Trump-Kennedy Center' following a board vote. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the change, citing President Trump's work in 'saving the building.' However, Rep. Joyce Beatty, an ex-officio board member, disputed the claim of a unanimous vote, stating she was muted when attempting to voice concerns. A Kennedy Center spokesperson reiterated that the vote was unanimous and the new name reflects bipartisan support. This renaming follows President Trump installing himself as chairman of the center earlier this year, replacing previous leadership with his own appointees. Trump had previously hinted at a name change, emphasizing his role in 'saving the Kennedy Center.' He is taking a keen interest in the center during his second term, promising to remove programming he disapproves of, and has allocated significant funds for its repairs. The center was originally called The National Cultural Center and was authorized for construction after President Kennedy's assassination.
