## Article summary
Federal prosecutors have identified the suspect in the killing of MIT professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro as his former classmate from Portugal, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente. Both men attended the same academic program in Portugal between 1995 and 2000. Mr. Neves Valente, who later became a U.S. permanent resident living in Florida, allegedly traveled to Providence, Rhode Island, in early December, renting a car and taking steps to conceal his identity and movements. License plate readers tracked the rental car near Brown University's campus in the days leading up to a shooting on December 13th, where two students were killed and nine others injured. Three days later, Dr. Loureiro was found dead from gunshot wounds at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. Security footage placed Mr. Neves Valente near Dr. Loureiro's residence shortly after the professor's death. Authorities believe Mr. Neves Valente then drove to a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, where he was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. With his death, authorities have closed both the Brown University shooting and the murder of Dr. Loureiro, stating Mr. Neves Valente was responsible for both incidents. The president of Brown University expressed hope that this outcome would bring a greater sense of safety to the community.
