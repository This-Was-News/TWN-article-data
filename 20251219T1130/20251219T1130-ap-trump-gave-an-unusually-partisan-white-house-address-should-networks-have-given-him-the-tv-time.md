## Article summary
When Donald Trump delivered a partisan address from the White House, major U.S. networks broadcast his remarks, which included factual misstatements and political attacks. This has raised questions about whether networks should provide airtime for such speeches simply at the president's request. Historically, networks have granted the president airtime for national addresses, but Trump's speech deviated from this norm by being overtly political rather than addressing a critical national issue. The decision to broadcast was complicated by recent FCC statements about its independence and Trump's history of pressuring media organizations. While networks typically err on the side of caution when the president requests to speak, past instances show requests have been denied. Trump announced his address on his social media platform, leading to speculation about its content, but its partisan nature became clear during the broadcast. The speech included accusations against the previous administration, exaggerated claims of success, and strong rhetoric on immigration. These factors, combined with business realities and the pressure Trump can exert, influence network decisions on whether to air presidential addresses.
