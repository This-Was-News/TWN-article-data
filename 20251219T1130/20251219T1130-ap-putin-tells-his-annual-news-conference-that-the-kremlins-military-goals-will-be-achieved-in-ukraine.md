## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated at his annual news conference that Moscow's troops are advancing in Ukraine and expressed confidence that the Kremlin's military objectives will be achieved if Kyiv does not accept Russia's conditions for peace talks. Putin asserted that Russian forces hold the strategic initiative and expect further gains by year's end. He reiterated Russia's readiness for a peaceful settlement based on its demands, which include the recognition of annexed territories as Russian and Ukraine's withdrawal from certain areas. Putin also insisted on Ukraine abandoning its NATO bid and warned against the deployment of NATO troops. He cautioned that any seizure of Russian assets would backfire and undermine investor confidence. Putin claimed that the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, exceeding 400,000 this year. The news conference, combined with a nationwide call-in show, is a platform Putin uses to assert his authority and address domestic and global issues. Meanwhile, EU leaders agreed on a loan for Ukraine but failed to reach a consensus on using frozen Russian assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated a willingness to drop NATO aspirations in exchange for security guarantees but prefers NATO membership. Putin also addressed a query about pension payments, vowing a swift resolution.
