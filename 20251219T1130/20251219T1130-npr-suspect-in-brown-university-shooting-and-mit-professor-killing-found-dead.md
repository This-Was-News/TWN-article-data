## Article summary
The suspect in the Brown University shooting and the killing of an MIT professor has been found dead. Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, a former Brown student and Portuguese national, died by suicide in a New Hampshire storage unit. Authorities believe Valente is responsible for the shooting at Brown University on Saturday, which killed two students and injured nine, and the fatal shooting of MIT physics professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro on Monday. The investigation gained traction after a tip led police to a car linked to the suspect, subsequently identifying him through surveillance footage and rental car paperwork. The news brought relief to the Providence community after days of fear. In response to the incidents, President Trump suspended the green card lottery program. Brown students Ella Cook and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov were killed in the campus shooting. Loureiro was a respected professor and director at MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, known for his work in fusion energy.
