## Article summary
European Union leaders have agreed to provide Ukraine with a 90 billion euro interest-free loan to support its military and economic needs for the next two years. This decision comes after a plan to utilize frozen Russian assets for the funding unraveled due to concerns raised by Belgium, where the majority of these assets are held. Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever cited legal risks and potential Russian retaliation as reasons for his opposition to using the assets. Despite these challenges, EU leaders managed to secure the loan package by borrowing from capital markets. While Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic initially opposed the loan, they ultimately did not block the deal and were assured protection from financial repercussions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had urged for a swift decision to prevent Ukraine from facing bankruptcy. The frozen Russian assets will remain blocked until Russia pays war reparations to Ukraine, which are estimated to cost over 600 billion euros. EU Council President António Costa emphasized that Europe stands behind Ukraine and reserves the right to use the immobilized assets to repay the loan if necessary. The agreement was reached during an EU summit in Brussels, which also saw protests from farmers regarding a proposed trade deal.
