## Article summary
This photo essay documents the resilience of Palestinian families in Gaza as they attempt to rebuild their lives amidst the widespread destruction caused by Israeli airstrikes. Following a ceasefire brokered in October 2025, families like the Halawas have returned to their homes, finding them reduced to rubble and debris. Despite the precarious state of their damaged buildings, they are making temporary repairs and establishing daily routines, prioritizing shelter over tents as winter approaches. The essay highlights the stark reality of living in ruins, with families adapting to makeshift living conditions, using scraps for repairs and finding solace in familiar objects and painted messages on their walls. The ongoing war, which began with Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in immense loss of life and displacement, with reconstruction efforts expected to take years. The images capture the determination of these families to maintain a sense of normalcy and hope, even as they face the constant threat of building collapses and the uncertainty of the future. The narrative underscores the human spirit's capacity to endure and strive for stability in the face of profound devastation.
