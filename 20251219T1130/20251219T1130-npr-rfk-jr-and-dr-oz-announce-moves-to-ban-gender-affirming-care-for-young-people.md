## Article summary
The Trump administration has proposed new rules that would effectively ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 18, using Medicare and Medicaid as leverage. These rules, announced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, would prohibit federal reimbursement for such care and block funding for hospitals that provide it. This move is expected to significantly restrict access to care nationwide, even in states where it is currently legal. The American Academy of Pediatrics has strongly opposed these measures, stating they misrepresent medical consensus and harm children and families. Legal challenges are anticipated, with the American Civil Liberties Union planning to sue. Activists like Chloe Cole, who regrets her transition, support the restrictions, while others, like the mother of a transgender teen, express fear and a sense of being targeted. The administration's actions align with previous efforts to restrict LGBTQ+ health initiatives, including canceling a suicide prevention lifeline for transgender youth and rescinding research funding. The proposed rules will undergo a 60-day public comment period before potentially taking effect.
