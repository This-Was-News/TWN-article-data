## Article summary
The suspect in the fatal shootings at Brown University and the killing of an MIT professor was found dead in a New Hampshire storage unit from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suspect, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a former Brown student, had killed two Brown students and wounded nine others before traveling to Massachusetts to kill MIT professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro. Authorities believe Neves Valente and Professor Loureiro may have known each other from attending the same academic program in Portugal. The investigation was aided by a Reddit user who reported seeing the suspect and his rental car. The Trump administration announced it would suspend the diversity immigrant visa program, through which Neves Valente had become a permanent U.S. resident. The motive behind the attacks remains unclear, with investigators noting no apparent connection between Neves Valente and the two Brown students who were killed. Neves Valente had taken steps to conceal his identity and movements, including changing license plates and using a phone that disguised his location. His death has closed both cases, offering a sense of closure to the affected communities, though the profound impact on the lives shattered is acknowledged.
