## Article summary
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has faced significant disruptions due to a government shutdown, causing immense stress and difficult choices for its 42 million recipients. Many individuals are struggling to afford basic necessities, with some resorting to extreme measures like dumpster diving for food. Stories from across the country highlight the varied impacts: a single mother in New Jersey has only $50 to feed her two sons, a 61-year-old in Oklahoma questions the cost of gas to reach a food pantry, and a woman in Colorado was found scavenging from a Walmart dumpster. The legal battles surrounding SNAP funding have created widespread confusion and anxiety, forcing recipients to ration food and cut expenses. For some, like a grocery store worker in Ohio, the cuts are visible in reduced sales of non-essential items, while others, like a mother in Milwaukee, cannot afford specialized formula for their infant. The uncertainty of future payments is a constant worry, impacting everything from holiday meals to basic daily sustenance. Many recipients express feelings of shame and failure, never expecting to rely on such assistance. The situation also affects those who work in food-related industries, like a farmer in Georgia whose customers depend on SNAP. The article emphasizes that the struggles faced by SNAP recipients could happen to anyone, highlighting the precarious financial situations many Americans find themselves in.
