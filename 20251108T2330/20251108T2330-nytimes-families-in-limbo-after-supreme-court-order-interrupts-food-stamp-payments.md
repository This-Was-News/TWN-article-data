## Article summary
Millions of low-income families are facing disruptions to their food stamp benefits following a late-night Supreme Court order that allows the Trump administration to continue withholding some funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This decision halts efforts by states like Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania, which had begun sending full benefits to recipients. The Supreme Court granted an emergency request to pause a federal judge's order that required the White House to fully fund SNAP, amidst the longest federal shutdown in history. The administration has refused to use available leftover funds to prevent interruptions, leading to uncertainty and delays for approximately 42 million Americans. In Ohio, initial promises of full benefits were rescinded, while Michigan and North Carolina abandoned their efforts to make swift payments. Some recipients, like Duwanna Alford in New York, experienced declined EBT card transactions, highlighting the immediate impact. Many Democrats have criticized the administration's actions, viewing the cutting of food benefits as a political bargaining chip. The legal battle continues, with an appeals court panel set to decide whether to uphold or halt the original order requiring full funding. While some states like Connecticut and Vermont have opted to use their own funds to ensure benefit delivery, the overall situation leaves many families in limbo as they await a final decision.
