## Article summary
Reusable water bottles, regardless of material, require regular cleaning to prevent the buildup of germs, mold, and bacteria. These microbes can enter bottles from our mouths and hands, and thrive in the hard-to-reach crevices, potentially causing stomach aches, itchy throats, and worsening allergies or asthma. While experts agree on the necessity of cleaning, they vary on the frequency and method. A daily routine of scrubbing with warm, soapy water, rinsing, and air-drying is generally recommended. For a deeper clean, using a dishwasher (if safe), denture tablets, or a vinegar/baking soda solution are suggested. If the bottle is used for beverages other than water, such as protein shakes or sugary drinks, daily cleaning becomes crucial due to residue that promotes bacterial growth. Emptying and rinsing the bottle between refills or at least every few days is also advised. Visible mold or an unusual smell indicates the bottle should not be used. Ultimately, maintaining a consistent cleaning habit, even a simple one, is vital for health.
