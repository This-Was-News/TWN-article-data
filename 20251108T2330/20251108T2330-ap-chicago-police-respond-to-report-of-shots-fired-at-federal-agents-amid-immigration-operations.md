## Article summary
Chicago police reported that shots were fired at federal agents on Saturday during immigration enforcement operations in the city. The Department of Homeland Security stated that a man in a black Jeep targeted the agents, but the suspect and vehicle have not been found. No injuries were reported from the gunfire. Tensions have been escalating due to an aggressive federal immigration operation in Chicago known as Operation Midway Blitz, which has led to protests. Residents have confronted federal agents, and some have clashed with Chicago police, whom they perceive as aiding the federal agents. In one incident, a police vehicle sustained damage to its taillight and windshield, and DHS reported that protesters threw a paint can and bricks at agent vehicles. A federal judge recently issued an injunction limiting agents' use of force following accusations that a Border Patrol official misrepresented threats from protesters.
