## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked full SNAP food benefits amidst a government shutdown, despite some states having already begun distributing them. This decision came as the Trump administration appealed a lower court's order to fully fund the program for November. The Supreme Court's action allows a lower court more time to consider a longer-term pause. This ruling may cause further confusion, as states had received funds to issue full benefits just as the appeal was filed. Following a federal judge's order on Thursday, several states, including California and Pennsylvania, started issuing full SNAP benefits, with some recipients receiving the funds on Friday. However, the Supreme Court's intervention requires states to revert to partial payments as initially directed by the Trump administration. The funding for SNAP, which serves nearly 42 million people, ran out a week ago due to the shutdown. A federal judge had criticized the administration for the partial payments, citing the "needless suffering" they would cause and suggesting political motivations. The administration argued it lacked emergency funds and that Congress should provide more, while also claiming that reallocating funds would harm other child nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department had previously tapped a contingency fund for about half the program's monthly budget, a move that involved a complicated recalculation process for states. Anti-hunger groups criticized the administration's delay in acting until a court order forced their hand.
