## Article summary
The White House has stated that naming the new Washington Commanders stadium after President Donald Trump would be "beautiful." This statement follows a report that an intermediary informed the Commanders' ownership group of Trump's desire for the stadium to bear his name. Trump is expected to attend a Commanders game, where American veterans will be honored. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt credited President Trump with making the rebuilding of the new stadium possible. The Washington Commanders and the office of the D.C. mayor have declined to comment on the report. A deal was announced in April for the team to return to the nation's capital with a new stadium costing nearly $4 billion, to be built on the site of the former RFK Stadium. President Biden signed a bill to transfer land for the stadium, which involves significant contributions from both the team and the city. This project includes housing, green space, and a sports complex. Previously, Trump had threatened to impede the stadium deal, demanding the team revert to its former name, the Redskins, which was considered offensive. Trump has a history of associating his name with various ventures, including buildings, hotels, golf courses, and branded merchandise.
