## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown is causing significant disruptions to air travel, with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reducing flights at 40 busy airports to alleviate pressure on unpaid air traffic controllers. These reductions, starting at 4% and potentially rising to 10% daily, are expected to cause delays and cancellations. Major airlines like United, Delta, and Alaska are offering increased flexibility for passengers to change or refund tickets, even if their flights are not directly canceled. Travelers are advised to download their airline's app, enable notifications, and be prepared for potential changes. If a flight is canceled, passengers are entitled to a full refund if they decline rebooking, and many airlines are waiving change fees. For those with flexible plans, rescheduling might be advisable to reduce system strain. While Thanksgiving travel is a concern, booking now with refundable options or travel insurance (though known events may not be covered) is recommended. The situation highlights the need for a swift resolution to the shutdown to avoid further travel chaos.
