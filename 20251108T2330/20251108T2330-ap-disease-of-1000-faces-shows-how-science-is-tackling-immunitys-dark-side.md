## Article summary
Ruth Wilson's six-year journey with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease affecting millions, highlights the challenges of diagnosis and the complexities of the immune system attacking the body. Lupus, known as the 'disease of 1,000 faces,' presents a wide range of symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose. Scientists are making strides in understanding autoimmune diseases by decoding their biology, inspired by research in cancer and COVID-19. These diseases, which include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Type 1 diabetes, are more prevalent in women. Researchers are exploring new treatments like CAR-T therapy and drugs such as teplizumab, which show promise in managing or even preventing these conditions. The focus is shifting towards understanding the root causes, such as the role of neutrophils in lupus, and identifying different subtypes of diseases to personalize treatment. Patient experiences, like Wilson's, are crucial in guiding research, emphasizing the importance of factors beyond physical symptoms, such as cognitive function and quality of life. Despite ongoing challenges, the current era is seen as a pivotal moment for autoimmune disease research, with hopes for better diagnostics, treatments, and potentially cures.
