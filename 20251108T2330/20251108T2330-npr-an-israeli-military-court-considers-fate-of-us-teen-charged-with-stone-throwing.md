## Article summary
An Israeli military court is currently reviewing the case of Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American from Florida who has been detained since February for allegedly throwing rocks in the occupied West Bank. He faces up to 20 years in prison under special West Bank security provisions that classify stone-throwing as a serious offense. Mohammed has been in Israeli custody without family visits or phone calls, turning 16 in prison. His family, who splits their time between Florida and the West Bank, describes his interrogation and detention as a Kafkaesque experience. They report he has suffered from scabies and significant weight loss, with U.S. lawmakers raising concerns about potential signs of torture. Despite being a U.S. citizen, his case has been subject to lengthy adjournments without a plea bargain or trial date. U.S. lawmakers have urged for his swift release, citing his deteriorating health. While the Israeli military states that defendants' rights are upheld and due process is followed, the family's lawyer notes that such cases often involve harsh conditions and limited rights for minors. Mohammed's father hopes for his release or a resolution at his upcoming hearing. The family also faces the difficult task of informing him about the death of his cousin, another U.S. citizen, who was killed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank earlier this year.
