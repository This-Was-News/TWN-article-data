## Article summary
Former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has been captured and arrived at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City. He was taken into U.S. custody during a military operation authorized by President Donald Trump. Maduro was processed at a DEA office in Manhattan before being transported to the Brooklyn detention center. He first arrived on U.S. soil at Stewart Air National Guard Base after reportedly being flown from Guantanamo Bay. Maduro is facing drug and weapons charges related to his alleged complicity in drug trafficking. His wife, Cilia, has also been taken into U.S. custody. The Metropolitan Detention Center, known for holding high-profile defendants, has faced criticism for its conditions. Maduro is expected to stand trial as early as Monday. The military operation that led to Maduro's capture also included strikes on Caracas and resulted in some U.S. service member injuries.
