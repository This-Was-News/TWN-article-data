## Article summary
President Trump announced that the U.S. will assume control of Venezuela for the foreseeable future following a military operation that led to the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. Trump stated that U.S. oil companies will invest billions to rebuild Venezuela's infrastructure, particularly its oil sector, with the aim of making the country prosperous. He described Maduro as an illegitimate dictator and a drug kingpin, and Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that Maduro and his wife would face trial in the U.S. for alleged crimes, including drug trafficking that Trump claims led to American deaths. The operation, involving over 150 aircraft, was months in the making and was ordered to proceed after intelligence confirmed Maduro's activities. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the decision not to notify Congress, characterizing the action as a law enforcement function. Trump asserted that controlling Venezuela aligns with the 'America First' agenda by promoting regional stability and securing energy resources, and claimed the operation would not cost American taxpayers as oil companies would reimburse the U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine reiterated the administration's stance on protecting American interests and warned adversaries.
