## Article summary
Bipartisan lawmakers have sharply criticized the United States' takeover of Venezuela, following President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. will run the country until a "safe, proper and judicious transition" can occur. This action followed U.S. strikes and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, who faces federal narco-terror charges. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, both Democrats, deemed the actions unconstitutional. Rep. Frost also criticized the administration's immigration priorities, contrasting them with the intervention. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, also voiced criticism, suggesting Trump aims to seize Venezuelan oil and institute regime change, while calling for action against cartels in Mexico. She expressed that such foreign interventions, coupled with rising domestic costs, enrage most Americans. Conversely, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican, supported Trump's actions, framing them as a defense of freedom and the rule of law, but cautioned against potential exploitation by dictators. U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat, suggested the President disregards Congress in his decision-making. The article also notes related events, including world leaders calling for a UN response to Maduro's capture.
