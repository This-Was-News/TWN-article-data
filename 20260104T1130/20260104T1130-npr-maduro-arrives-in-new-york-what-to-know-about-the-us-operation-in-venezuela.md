## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced the U.S. military operation in Venezuela resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, who was then transported to New York and expected to face trial. The U.S. Attorney General stated Maduro and his wife are indicted on drug trafficking charges. In response, Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as president, though her whereabouts are unknown. The strikes occurred in the early morning, with explosions reported in Caracas and other Venezuelan states. The U.S. government accuses Maduro of leading a narco-trafficking organization and stealing oil. Trump stated the U.S. will "run" Venezuela, aiming to restore its oil infrastructure with U.S. companies. The future leadership of Venezuela remains uncertain, with opposition leader María Corina Machado endorsing Edmundo Gonzalez. International reactions are mixed, with some U.S. Democrats criticizing the lack of Congressional authorization, while many Republicans praise the action. Latin American nations have expressed concern, though Argentina's president supported the operation. The European Union and the U.K. called for restraint and adherence to international law.
