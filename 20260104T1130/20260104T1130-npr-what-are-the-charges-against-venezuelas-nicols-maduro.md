## Article summary
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, face new criminal charges in the United States following a U.S. military action in Caracas. A federal indictment in New York charges Maduro with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and weapons charges. The indictment alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders have used their positions to import tons of cocaine into the U.S., partnering with international drug trafficking organizations. Maduro and other Venezuelan officials allegedly enriched themselves by providing protection and logistical support to drug traffickers. Specific actions detailed include selling diplomatic passports to traffickers and facilitating the transport of drug proceeds. Prosecutors claim Maduro and Flores trafficked cocaine seized by Venezuelan law enforcement and used state-sponsored gangs to protect their operations, ordering violence against those who owed them money. These new charges add to earlier indictments from March 2020. The U.S. had previously increased the bounty for Maduro's arrest and designated the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. The International Criminal Court is also investigating the Venezuelan government for alleged human rights abuses.
