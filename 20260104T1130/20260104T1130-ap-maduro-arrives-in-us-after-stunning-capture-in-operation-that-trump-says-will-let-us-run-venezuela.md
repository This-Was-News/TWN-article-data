## Article summary
Deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has arrived in the United States to face criminal charges following a nighttime military operation that captured him and his wife from their home. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela and exploit its oil reserves. The operation, described by Maduro's government as imperialist, is the most assertive U.S. action for regime change since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Legal experts have raised questions about the operation's legality, as it was conducted without congressional approval. Maduro and his wife face U.S. charges related to a narco-terrorism conspiracy. The Trump administration had been increasing pressure on Venezuela for months, including attacks on drug-smuggling vessels. The capture occurred 36 years after the U.S. invasion of Panama and the seizure of its leader, Manuel Noriega. While some in Venezuela celebrated Maduro's capture, others protested. The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to meet to discuss the U.S. operations in Venezuela. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy indicated that major U.S. military action was unlikely to continue immediately, as airspace restrictions expired.
