## Article summary
President Trump has declared that the United States will govern Venezuela for an indefinite period, aiming to secure economic and political dominance over the nation. This announcement follows the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces. Trump stated that Vice President Delcy Rodríguez would hold power as long as she complies with U.S. demands. However, Rodríguez has publicly denounced the U.S. action as an invasion and asserted Maduro's continued leadership. Trump's administration avoided characterizing the plan as an occupation, likening it instead to a guardianship where the U.S. would dictate governance during a transition. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated a wait-and-see approach regarding Venezuela's response. Trump suggested further military action if resistance is met and identified Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and General Dan Caine as key figures in running Venezuela. A primary U.S. objective is regaining access to oil rights, which Trump claims were stolen from the United States. This move signals a return to gunboat diplomacy and has drawn comparisons to 19th and early 20th-century U.S. imperial actions. The administration cited a 2020 indictment for drug trafficking as legal basis for Maduro's rendition, but this indictment does not justify taking control of the country. Trump justified the seizure of resources by stating Venezuela had stolen American assets and oil, promising compensation to Americans before Venezuelans. The long-term implications, including the need for an occupying military force and the potential for prolonged "forever wars," remain uncertain. Trump dismissed these concerns by referencing past successful targeted attacks, though these differ from nation-building efforts. Venezuela's size and complexity present significant challenges, and the reaction of its armed forces will be a crucial factor in any democratic transition.
