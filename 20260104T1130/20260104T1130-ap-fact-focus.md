## Article summary
President Donald Trump held a news conference to discuss the U.S. raid to extract Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, during which he repeated several false claims about crime and drug interdiction efforts. Trump falsely claimed that each drug boat intercepted by the U.S. saves 25,000 American lives, a number that far exceeds actual drug overdose deaths and the number of boats targeted. He also inaccurately stated that there had been no killings in Washington, D.C., for six to seven months, despite police department statistics showing numerous homicides during that period. Regarding National Guard deployments, Trump claimed crime went down in Chicago and that Los Angeles was "saved" by these deployments. However, National Guard members were not on the streets in Chicago as part of the mission, and their deployment in Los Angeles was complex, involving legal challenges and eventual removal from street control. The article fact-checks these claims, providing data from the CDC and police departments to refute Trump's assertions about crime reduction and the impact of U.S. military actions.
