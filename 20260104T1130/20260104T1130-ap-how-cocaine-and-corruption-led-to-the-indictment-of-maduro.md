## Article summary
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has been indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy. The indictment, unsealed after his capture in a military operation, accuses Maduro of leading a corrupt government fueled by an extensive drug-trafficking operation that sent thousands of tons of cocaine to the U.S. The indictment alleges that Maduro partnered with powerful drug cartels and provided them with government support in exchange for profits. His wife is also accused of accepting bribes and facilitating drug trafficking. The U.S. authorities claim that Maduro and his family ordered kidnappings, beatings, and murders of those who interfered with their drug operations. The military operation to capture Maduro was described as a law enforcement function by U.S. officials. President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela and utilize its oil reserves following Maduro's removal. Maduro's nephews were previously sentenced for drug trafficking conspiracy and later released in a prisoner swap. The indictment adds new charges against Maduro's wife, building on earlier charges from 2020.
