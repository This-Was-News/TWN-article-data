## Article summary
President Trump has stated that U.S. oil companies will invest billions in Venezuela to repair its oil infrastructure following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. Despite Venezuela possessing the world's largest proven oil reserves, its current production is a fraction of its past output. Many international oil companies have had negative experiences in Venezuela, and the global oil market is currently oversupplied with uncertain long-term demand due to the shift towards electric vehicles. Historically, U.S. interventions in other countries have not always ended well, raising concerns about the feasibility of Trump's plans. Venezuelan oil is heavy, dense, requires specialized refineries, and is considered one of the dirtiest to produce in terms of global warming. Several U.S. oil companies, including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, are owed billions by Venezuela due to forcefully renegotiated contracts under former President Hugo Chávez. Chevron, which stayed in Venezuela, currently produces about a quarter of the country's oil. While Venezuela is a "brownfield" site, meaning its oil reserves are well-understood, the current global oil glut and environmental concerns make it less attractive. Neighboring Guyana, however, is a rising oil star with lighter, less polluting oil and more favorable tax conditions. The lack of political stability and unclear legal framework in Venezuela poses a significant risk for potential long-term investments by oil companies.
