## Article summary
The United States military has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a raid in Caracas and brought him to New York to face federal drug trafficking charges. President Trump announced the U.S. intends to run Venezuela for an unspecified period to reclaim oil interests, raising concerns about an open-ended military commitment. Despite the capture, Maduro's aides, including Vice President Delcy Rodríguez who was sworn in as interim leader, appear to maintain control in Venezuela and have denounced the U.S. action. U.S. officials expressed a desire to work with Rodríguez, believing she would support American energy investments. The raid resulted in at least 40 Venezuelan casualties, with no American service members killed but some injured. Legal experts are questioning the U.S. administration's authority to govern Venezuela. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, face multiple charges, including narco-terrorism. Meanwhile, protests and celebrations have occurred in U.S. cities, reflecting divided opinions on the intervention. European leaders have largely refrained from criticizing the operation, though some within the UK have faced backlash for not condemning it. Elon Musk's Starlink announced free broadband service for Venezuela. The U.S. has previously recognized Maduro as president, but more recently has not, complicating claims of head of state immunity. The legal basis for the U.S. running Venezuela and the legality of the extraction under international law are subjects of debate.
