## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, by U.S. forces, stating they were indicted for narcoterrorism and that the U.S. would temporarily control Venezuela. However, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker denounced Trump's actions as unconstitutional and putting troops at risk without a clear strategy. U.S. Representative Mike Quigley also criticized the move as a violation of law. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson echoed these sentiments, linking the action to the dehumanization of migrants. Trump defended his actions by invoking the Monroe Doctrine and highlighting the capture of criminals. He also claimed the U.S. military's involvement had reduced crime in some U.S. cities. Trump further suggested that foreign investment in Venezuela's oil industry would fund the country's recovery and benefit its citizens and those living in the U.S.
