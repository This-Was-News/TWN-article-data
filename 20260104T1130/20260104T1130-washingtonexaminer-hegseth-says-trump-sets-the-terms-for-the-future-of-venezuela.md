## Article summary
War Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that President Donald Trump will dictate the future of Venezuela following U.S. military strikes and the capture of Nicolas Maduro. Hegseth indicated that the U.S. will "set the terms" for Venezuela's transition to new leadership, emphasizing American control over the process. The Trump administration plans to continue its crackdown on drug trafficking and illegal immigration in Venezuela, and ensure the return of stolen oil to the U.S. The existing blockade on oil tankers will also remain in place. President Trump previously announced that the U.S. would effectively control Venezuela until a "safe, proper and judicious transition" could occur. Trump also intends to bring in major U.S. oil companies to revitalize Venezuela's oil industry and generate revenue for the country. The strikes, codenamed "Operation Absolute Resolve," targeted multiple locations in Caracas and resulted in the capture of Maduro and his wife, who now face U.S. charges. This operation coincides with the anniversary of the raid that captured Manuel Noriega in Panama. The UN Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting regarding the events in Venezuela.
