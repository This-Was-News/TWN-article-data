## Article summary
Venezuelas Supreme Court has ordered Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to assume the role of interim president following the capture and detention of Nicolas Maduro by the United States in New York City. The court cited Maduros "material and temporary impossibility" to fulfill his presidential duties, as per the nation's constitution. However, there are conflicting reports regarding Rodriguez's whereabouts, with some suggesting she was in Russia while she also delivered a televised address asserting Maduro's continued presidency. President Donald Trump stated that Rodriguez had agreed to cooperate with any leadership changes, indicating she had no choice. Trump also revealed that the U.S. would temporarily govern Venezuela, leaving Rodriguez with limited options. Maduro is currently detained in a New York City federal facility and is expected to face trial soon. The U.S. military operation leading to Maduros capture and the subsequent court order mark a significant shift in Venezuelan leadership.
