## Article summary
The once-thriving border village of Martoli in India's Uttarakhand state has been largely abandoned since the 1962 India-China conflict sealed the border, disrupting trade and life. The village, nestled in the Johar Valley and surrounded by Himalayan peaks, had about 500 residents at its peak. Now, only a few villagers return each summer, like 77-year-old Kishan Singh, who farms buckwheat and strawberries. A new guesthouse caters to trekkers heading to the Nanda Devi base camp. Nearby villages like Laspa, Ghanghar, and Rilkot are also seeing a slow return of residents, aided by a recently built unpaved road. The area's fertile land and scenic beauty continue to attract a few visitors and returning villagers, bringing a glimmer of life back to the abandoned villages.
