## Article summary
A federal judge in San Francisco is set to hear arguments on whether to halt the Trump administration's latest wave of federal employee layoffs, known as reductions-in-force (RIFs). The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) have sued, alleging the layoffs are an illegal abuse of power. The Trump administration has argued the court lacks jurisdiction. The layoffs target various agencies, including the Department of Education, Housing and Urban Development, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Over 4,000 federal employees have received layoff notices, with some later reversed due to errors. The unions claim the administration is disregarding legal requirements and violating the Antideficiency Act. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate actions taken based on OMB and OPM guidance. The Trump administration has blamed Democrats for the shutdown and claims the layoffs are necessary due to the lapse in Congressional appropriations. This is the second case involving mass layoffs that the judge is presiding over this year. In May, the judge paused Trump's government overhaul, but the Supreme Court later lifted the order.
