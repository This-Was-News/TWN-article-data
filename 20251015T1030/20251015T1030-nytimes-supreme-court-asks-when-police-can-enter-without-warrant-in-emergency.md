## Article summary
The Supreme Court is reviewing a case involving police entry into a home without a warrant during an emergency. The case involves William Trevor Case, an Army veteran who was shot by police after they entered his home without a warrant following a report that he might be suicidal. The police entered after observing signs of distress, including empty beer cans, a gun holster, and a possible suicide note. Case was convicted of assaulting an officer but appealed, arguing that the evidence should have been excluded due to the warrantless entry. The Supreme Court must decide the level of certainty police need before entering a home without a warrant. Case's lawyers argue for a high standard of probable cause, while Montana's attorney general advocates for a more flexible standard. The outcome will impact police tactics and privacy rights. The Trump administration supports the state, while civil liberties groups back Case. The case hinges on balancing emergency response needs with Fourth Amendment protections.
