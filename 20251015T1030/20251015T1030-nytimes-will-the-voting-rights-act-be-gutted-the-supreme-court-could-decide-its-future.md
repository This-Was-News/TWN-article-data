## Article summary
The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on a challenge to Louisianas congressional map, focusing on whether states can consider race in redistricting. The case, stemming from the 2020 census, involves a dispute over the creation of a second majority-Black district. If the Court rules that race cannot be a factor in drafting maps, it could significantly impact the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and lead to shifts in congressional seats. The legal battle began when Black voters sued, claiming their voting power was diluted. A federal judge initially agreed, leading to a revised map with a second majority-Black district. However, white voters then sued, arguing the new map was an illegal racial gerrymander. The Supreme Court paused the lower courts order, allowing the new map to be used in the 2024 election. The justices have since expanded the case to consider the constitutionality of using race in redistricting under the Voting Rights Act. The case has seen shifting alliances, with Louisiana officials now aligning with the white voter plaintiffs. The outcome could have broad implications for minority representation and the future of the Voting Rights Act.
