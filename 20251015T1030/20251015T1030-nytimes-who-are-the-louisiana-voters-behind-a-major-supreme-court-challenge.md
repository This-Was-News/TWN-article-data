## Article summary
A group of 12 Louisiana voters, including a retired grocery salesman and a member of the Trumpettes, challenged the state's congressional district map, arguing it discriminated against them as white voters by considering race. The case, set to be heard by the Supreme Court, could significantly impact the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The plaintiffs, who remain largely anonymous, are represented by a lawyer who has long challenged the use of race in voting maps. The case, known as Callais, involves a map that includes a second majority-Black district, which the plaintiffs argue is a racial gerrymander. The Supreme Court will explore whether the map violates the 14th and 15th Amendments, making this a critical test for the future of the Voting Rights Act.
