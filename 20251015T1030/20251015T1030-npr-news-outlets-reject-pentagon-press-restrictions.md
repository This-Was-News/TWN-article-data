## Article summary
Several major news organizations, including The New York Times, NPR, and Newsmax, are refusing to sign new Pentagon press restrictions that require reporters to pledge not to gather unauthorized information. The rules, which also mandate prominent badges and further restrict access, are seen as a violation of the First Amendment and a form of prior restraint. The Pentagon's Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has been criticized for limiting media access and transparency. News organizations argue that signing the agreement could compromise their independence and potentially implicate them in national security violations. Without signing, reporters will lose their press passes and access to the Pentagon. The uniform rejection of these rules by a wide range of news outlets highlights their objection to Hegseth's authority and the potential legal challenges that may arise.
