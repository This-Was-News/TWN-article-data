## Article summary
The Delaware Supreme Court will hear arguments regarding Tesla CEO Elon Musk's record-setting compensation package, which was approved in 2018 and tied to Tesla's performance. The package, worth potentially over $100 billion, has been contested in a lawsuit by shareholder Richard Tornetta, who argues that the board was influenced by Musk and shareholders were not adequately informed. The Chancery Court initially ruled against the package, but Tesla resubmitted it and shareholders approved it again in 2024. The Supreme Court will now decide if the package was a valid business decision or if it reflects undue influence. Meanwhile, Tesla's board has proposed a new compensation package that could make Musk the world's first trillionaire, pending shareholder approval. The case has broader implications for Delaware's corporate law, as companies consider leaving the state due to recent legal decisions. The Delaware legislature has also passed new laws to protect its business-friendly reputation.
