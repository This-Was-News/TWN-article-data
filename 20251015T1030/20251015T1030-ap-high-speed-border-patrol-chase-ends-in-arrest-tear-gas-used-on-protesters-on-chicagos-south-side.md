## Article summary
A high-speed chase involving Border Patrol agents in Chicago's South Side ended with an arrest and the use of tear gas on protesters. The chase began when a driver suspected of being in the country illegally rammed into a Border Patrol vehicle and fled. Agents pursued the vehicle until the driver stopped and attempted to flee on foot. As agents arrested the person, a crowd gathered, and tear gas was deployed to disperse them. Chicago Police confirmed the use of tear gas by federal agents. Protesters were seen waving flags and throwing objects at the agents. Thirteen Chicago police officers were exposed to tear gas. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker condemned the federal agents' treatment of protesters as abominable. Similar incidents of tear gas deployment by federal agents have occurred in other Chicago neighborhoods. Protests over federal immigration crackdowns have spread throughout Chicago, including outside a federal immigration facility. Recently, federal prosecutors obtained an indictment against two individuals accused of using their vehicles to strike a Border Patrol agent's vehicle. Immigration activists rallied in Springfield to expand sanctuary city protections under the state's Trust Act.
