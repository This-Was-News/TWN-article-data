## Article summary
President Donald Trump is making this government shutdown unlike any other, with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) headed by Russ Vought deciding who gets paid or fired. The shutdown, now in its third week, is seeing unprecedented restructuring across the federal workforce, with programs favored by Democrats being targeted and unlikely to reopen. The OMB is preparing for more reductions in force, with over 4,100 federal workers receiving layoff notices. Trump's priorities, such as supporting the military and pursuing his mass deportation agenda, remain largely uninterrupted. The administration has found funding to ensure certain programs, like the Women, Infants, and Children food aid program, continue. However, other programs, including those in health, education, and sciences, are being shuttered. Congress is at a standstill, with the Republican-led House refusing to return to session and the Senate stuck in a loop of failed votes to reopen the government. The shutdown is quickly becoming one of the longest in history, with no signs of resolution as Democrats demand health care funding.
