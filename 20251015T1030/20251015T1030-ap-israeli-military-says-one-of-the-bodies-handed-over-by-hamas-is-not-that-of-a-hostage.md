## Article summary
The Israeli military announced that one of the bodies handed over by Hamas as part of the ceasefire deal is not that of a hostage held in Gaza, increasing tensions over the fragile truce in the two-year war. Four bodies were initially handed over by Hamas to ease pressure on the ceasefire, following the release of the last 20 living hostages. Israel has been awaiting the return of 28 deceased hostages and has released around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The military identified that the fourth body did not match any of the hostages, with no immediate information on its identity. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu demanded Hamas fulfill the ceasefire requirements regarding the return of hostage bodies. The U.S.-proposed ceasefire plan called for all hostages, living and dead, to be handed over by a deadline that expired on Monday. Hamas has previously returned a wrong body to Israel, causing additional distress. Both Hamas and the Red Cross have cited the challenges of recovering remains due to Gaza's destruction. Israeli defense minister Israel Katz warned that anyone approaching the deployment line would be targeted. The bodies of two hostages were to be buried on Wednesday, with public participation in the procession. Forensic experts in Gaza began identifying 45 bodies of Palestinians handed over by Israel through the Red Cross. The entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza was paused for two days due to the prisoner and hostage exchange and a Jewish holiday. Israel and Hamas are arguing over the slow return of the bodies of deceased hostages, with Israel allowing only half of the daily aid trucks called for under the deal.
