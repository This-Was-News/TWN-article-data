## Article summary
Israel has kept the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza closed and reduced aid deliveries by half, citing delays by Hamas in handing over hostage bodies. The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S., includes the exchange of hostages and detainees, with Hamas handing over eight bodies to the Red Cross. Israel had promised to allow 600 aid trucks daily but has reduced this to 300, also restricting fuel and gas shipments. Hamas claims it needs more time to recover additional bodies due to unknown burial sites from Israeli airstrikes. The ceasefire agreement stipulates that Hamas must share information and make efforts to hand over the bodies promptly. Israel has warned Gazans to avoid areas where its forces are present. Despite the ceasefire, Hamas accuses Israel of violating the agreement with attacks in Gaza. Israel has released 1,700 Palestinian prisoners and 242 long-term sentenced prisoners, sending many into exile. The exchange includes a formula of 15 Palestinian bodies for every Israeli body received, but only 45 Palestinian remains have been handed over so far.
