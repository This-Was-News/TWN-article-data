## Article summary
The Supreme Court is hearing a case that could strike down the last major part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The case involves Louisiana's redistricting and questions the constitutionality of Section 2 of the Act, which aims to prevent minority voters from being shut out of the redistricting process. The Court previously upheld this provision in a similar Alabama case, but now some justices seem to have doubts. The case involves a challenge to Louisiana's creation of a second majority-minority congressional district, which some argue is racially discriminatory. The state's solicitor general argues that the motivation was partisan, not racial. The Court has ordered reargument and is considering whether the redistricting violates the Constitution's 14th and 15th amendments. If Section 2 is overturned, it could lead to significant changes in congressional representation and make it harder for Democrats to control the House. The outcome of the case is uncertain, with theories suggesting that Justice Kavanaugh may have changed his stance or that the Court was unable to reach a majority agreement earlier.
