## Article summary
A devastating fire at a Hong Kong residential complex has claimed at least 55 lives, making it one of the city's deadliest blazes in modern history. Firefighters battled the inferno for a second day at the Wang Fuk Court complex, which houses thousands of residents. Thick smoke continued to billow from the buildings, and flames were still visible. Hong Kong leader John Lee reported that contact had been lost with 279 people by midnight Thursday. The fire, which began in scaffolding and netting, spread rapidly across seven of the complex's eight towers. Authorities have confirmed 51 deaths at the scene and four more in hospitals, including one firefighter. Over 70 people were injured, and approximately 900 residents were evacuated to temporary shelters. Three men, identified as directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company, have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, with police investigating potential gross negligence and the use of substandard materials. The complex, built in the 1980s, was undergoing major renovations, prompting an anti-corruption agency probe into possible corruption related to the project. The rapid spread of the fire is suspected to be linked to flammable materials like Styrofoam found near elevator lobbies. The incident has spurred discussions about replacing bamboo scaffolding with metal and led to immediate inspections of renovation sites across the city to ensure safety standards are met.
