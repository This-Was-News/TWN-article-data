## Article summary
Bruna Ferreira, 33, who was once engaged to the brother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, is currently in ICE custody. Ferreira was arrested on November 12th in Massachusetts while on her way to pick up her son from school. Her attorney states she was not informed of the reason for her detention and was transferred between multiple states before ending up in Louisiana. Ferreira's attorney claims she is a business owner who pays taxes and is not a danger or flight risk. He also mentioned she came to the U.S. from Brazil as a child and was in the process of applying for a green card. The Department of Homeland Security stated Ferreira entered the U.S. on a tourist visa that expired in 1999 and alleged a previous arrest for battery, which her attorney denies. Court records show she had two motor vehicle violations in 2020 that were resolved after she completed a safe driving course. The White House press secretary declined to comment on the situation. President Donald Trump's administration has been altering immigration policies, including those affecting DACA recipients, stating they are not automatically protected from deportation.
