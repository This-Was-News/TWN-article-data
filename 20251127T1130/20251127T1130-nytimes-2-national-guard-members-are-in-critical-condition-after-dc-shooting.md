## Article summary
Two National Guard members from West Virginia are in critical condition after being shot near the White House by a lone gunman, who has been detained. The suspect, identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 through a Biden-era immigration program for Afghans. In response to the incident, the Trump administration has paused the processing of all immigration applications from Afghan nationals indefinitely, affecting asylum seekers, permanent residency applicants, and those seeking Special Immigrant Visas. President Trump condemned the shooting as an act of terror, used it to criticize immigration policies, and ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington D.C. Some National Guard members and officials had previously expressed concerns about the safety of troops deployed in American cities, citing a heightened threat environment. A federal judge had previously ruled the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Washington D.C. likely illegal, though the administration appealed the decision. The shooting occurred near the Farragut West Metro station, causing alarm among bystanders and tourists. The program that allowed the suspect entry, Operation Allies Welcome, was developed by the Biden administration to aid vulnerable Afghans fleeing the Taliban takeover.
