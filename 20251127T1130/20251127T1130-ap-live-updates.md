## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV has embarked on his first foreign trip to Turkey and Lebanon, aiming to foster peace amidst ongoing global conflicts. The primary purpose of his visit to Turkey is to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, a significant event in Christian history. During his time in Turkey, the Pope met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and addressed the diplomatic corps, also visiting the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. While in Istanbul, he will participate in ecumenical and interfaith meetings. The Pope's journey also highlights the Vatican's support for Lebanon, a country grappling with severe political unrest, economic collapse, and the aftermath of war. He is scheduled to visit the site of the Beirut port blast and offer words of encouragement to the youth. The trip underscores the importance of interfaith dialogue, with the Pope set to visit the Blue Mosque and preside over interfaith gatherings. This visit also occurs amid heightened regional tensions, including the Israel-Hamas war, and follows Pope Francis's previous efforts to promote peace and religious tolerance. The Pope's message emphasizes unity and harmony among people of different religions and beliefs. Residents of Istanbul have expressed mixed feelings about the visit, with some anticipating economic benefits and others believing its significance should not be overstated. A notable aspect of the trip is the potential reopening of the Halki Theological School, a symbol of Orthodox heritage in Turkey.
