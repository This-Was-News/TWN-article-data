## Article summary
In Guinea-Bissau, opposition candidate Fernando Dias has claimed victory in the recent presidential election and accused incumbent President Umaro Sissoco Embaló of staging a coup to avoid defeat. Military officers appeared on state television announcing a takeover, claiming they had uncovered a plot to manipulate election results involving politicians and a drug lord. Embaló stated he was arrested, though Dias claims this was fabricated. The main opposition party was barred from the vote, leading its leader to support Dias. Civil society groups and Dias have called for protests. Guinea-Bissau has a history of coups and political instability, exacerbated by its role as a drug trafficking hub. International bodies have condemned the reported coup. The situation unfolds amidst a recent surge of military takeovers in West Africa.
