## Article summary
A devastating fire has swept through the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 55 confirmed deaths and leaving many residents missing. The blaze, which started on Wednesday afternoon, quickly spread across multiple high-rise towers, exacerbated by flammable building materials and bamboo scaffolding. Over 1,200 firefighters have been battling the inferno, but rescue efforts are severely hampered by intense heat, falling debris, and the sheer height of the buildings. Authorities suspect that building materials used on the exteriors did not meet fire-safety standards, leading to the fire's rapid escalation. In response to the tragedy, Hong Kong police have arrested two directors and a consultant from a construction company on suspicion of manslaughter, citing gross negligence. The fire has drawn comparisons to the Grenfell Tower disaster in London due to similar contributing factors like combustible exterior materials and the challenges of fighting high-rise fires. Temporary shelters have been set up for thousands of displaced residents, many of whom described harrowing escapes with little to no warning. The Hong Kong government had previously announced plans to phase out bamboo scaffolding due to fire risks, a measure that has now become tragically relevant. Investigations are ongoing, with a special task force established to look into the cause of the fire and potential corruption related to building renovations.
