## Article summary
Operation Allies Welcome was a U.S. program established by the Biden administration in August 2021 following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. This initiative allowed certain vulnerable Afghan nationals to enter the United States on two-year grants of parole, without granting permanent immigration status. Participants were expected to seek other avenues for remaining in the country, such as applying for asylum. Initially, Afghans in the program were processed and housed at U.S. military bases before being resettled nationwide. The program aimed to assist those who had supported U.S. troops and American efforts in Afghanistan and were at risk of Taliban retribution. Officials stated that the program included vetting and security checks. The Congressional Research Service estimated that approximately 77,000 Afghans entered the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome, which operated for about a year. The program faced Republican criticism regarding the thoroughness of vetting procedures. A Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report identified flaws, including data inaccuracies in some individuals' files.
