## Article summary
This article from NPR's Life Kit series warns consumers about common marketing tricks used during the holiday shopping season. Retailers employ tactics designed to encourage impulse buys and overspending. One common strategy is creating a false sense of urgency with phrases like "buy now" or "flash deal," playing on shoppers' fear of missing out. Experts advise taking a moment to consider the purchase, as opportunities to buy products are usually ongoing. Another trick is "price anchoring," where a high "original price" is displayed next to a sale price to make the deal seem more attractive, even if the original price was not genuine. To counter this, shoppers should focus on the actual price and decide if it's a good value independently. "High-low pricing" involves inflating the base price before a sale, making a percentage discount seem more significant than it is. Price comparison, checking historical pricing data, or looking at other retailers can help avoid this. Finally, marketers often "build a fantasy," selling an idealized version of life or self that can be achieved through purchasing certain products. The article encourages shoppers to pause and consider if they are buying based on aspiration rather than genuine need. It also suggests creative and meaningful gift alternatives like homemade items or experiences.
