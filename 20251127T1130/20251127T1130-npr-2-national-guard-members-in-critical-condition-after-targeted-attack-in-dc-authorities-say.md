## Article summary
Two members of the West Virginia National Guard were critically wounded in a shooting incident that occurred a few blocks north of the White House in Washington, D.C. The shooting took place on Wednesday afternoon, November 26, 2025, and emergency responders were dispatched to the scene at 2:18 p.m. ET. Three gunshot victims were treated and transported to a hospital. The suspect is in custody and was also reported to be wounded. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the critical condition of the two Guard members and announced plans to send an additional 500 Guard troops to D.C. at the request of President Trump. Governor Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia initially reported that two Guard members were killed but later corrected his statement due to conflicting reports. Federal agents from the FBI were on the scene assisting with the investigation. This incident occurs amidst a larger deployment of over 2,000 National Guard personnel to D.C. for patrols and beautification efforts, a deployment that a federal judge recently ruled as unlawful, though the order was not yet in effect pending appeal.
