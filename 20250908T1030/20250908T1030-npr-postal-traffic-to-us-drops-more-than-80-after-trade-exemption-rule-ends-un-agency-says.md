## Article summary
Postal traffic to the U.S. has dropped significantly after the Trump administration ended a trade exemption rule in late August 2024. The U.N.'s Universal Postal Union (UPU) reported that traffic to the U.S. nearly halted after the 'de minimis' rule, which exempted small packages worth less than $800 from tariffs, was suspended. Data showed an 81% drop in traffic on August 29, 2024, compared to a week earlier. The UPU is working on solutions to restore postal flow to the U.S. President Trump signed an executive order in July 2024 to end the 'de minimis' rule, aiming to combat criminal activity and reduce the trade deficit. The administration claims the move will help secure the border and protect American families. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott supported the decision, stating it would prevent the influx of counterfeit goods and fentanyl. At least 88 postal operators have suspended services to the U.S. until a solution is found. The UPU is committed to ensuring the free circulation of postal items and is developing a technical solution to resume mail delivery to the U.S.
