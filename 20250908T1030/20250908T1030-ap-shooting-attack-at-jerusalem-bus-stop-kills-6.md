## Article summary
A shooting attack at a bus stop in north Jerusalem on Monday resulted in six deaths and 12 injuries, according to Israeli police and emergency services. The attackers, identified as Palestinians, opened fire on people waiting at the bus stop. An Israeli soldier and civilian at the scene shot and killed the attackers. The incident occurred at a busy intersection near Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem. Footage showed chaos with a bus riddled with bullets and people fleeing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the scene, delaying his corruption trial. He warned of Israel fighting on multiple fronts, including Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas praised the attack without claiming responsibility. The Israeli military is encircling Palestinian villages near Ramallah in response. The attack is the deadliest since October 2024, when a similar incident in Tel Aviv killed seven people. Data from the U.N. reports at least 49 Israelis and 968 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war.
