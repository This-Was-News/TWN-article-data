## Article summary
Prince Harry is set to visit the UK, sparking speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles III, after 19 months of limited contact. The visit coincides with the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, offering a chance for reconciliation. Harry's relationship with the royal family has been strained since he and Meghan Markle stepped back from royal duties in 2020 and publicly shared their grievances. The last time Harry saw Charles was in February 2024, when the king was diagnosed with cancer. Despite Harry's recent legal battle over police protection, he expressed a desire for reconciliation, though his criticisms of the royal household may complicate efforts. Recent interactions between their teams suggest a shift in tone. Harry will attend the WellChild Awards in London, an event aligned with his charitable work. His memoir, 'Spare,' has further strained relations by revealing private family dynamics. King Charles, now 76 and undergoing cancer treatment, may seek to mend ties to spend more time with his grandchildren. Harry has emphasized the importance of truth in any reconciliation, leaving the decision to his family.
