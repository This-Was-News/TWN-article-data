## Article summary
Carlos Alcaraz won his second U.S. Open title by defeating Jannik Sinner in a four-set match at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City. The final was the third straight Grand Slam showdown between the two rivals, dubbed 'The New Two' or 'Sncaraz,' with Alcaraz reclaiming the world number one ranking and a $5 million prize. President Trump attended the match from Rolex's luxury box, drawing mixed reactions from the crowd. His presence led to enhanced security measures, causing delays and long lines for ticket holders. Rolex CEO Jean-Frederic Dufour was seen with Trump, who waved to the crowd. The broadcast of the national anthem was delayed, with reports suggesting broadcasters were instructed to edit out crowd reactions to Trump. Videos of the booing crowd surfaced on social media. Trump's attendance at the event, sponsored by Rolex, comes amid a 39% tariff on Swiss products. This marks the first time a sitting president has attended the U.S. Open since Bill Clinton in 2000, with Trump also planning to host a UFC fight at the White House next year.
