## Article summary
The article details how JPMorgan Chase maintained a long-standing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender and human trafficker, despite numerous red flags and internal concerns. Epstein was a valuable client for JPMorgan, generating millions in revenue and facilitating important business deals, including the acquisition of Highbridge Capital Management. Key figures within the bank, such as James Dimon and Jes Staley, were instrumental in keeping Epstein as a client, even after his criminal history became public. The bank's compliance and anti-money laundering teams repeatedly raised concerns about Epstein's suspicious financial activities, including large cash withdrawals and wire transfers, but these warnings were often overridden by senior management. The article highlights the bank's failure to cut ties with Epstein, despite knowing about his criminal activities, and the subsequent legal and reputational consequences. It also explores the broader implications of the bank's actions, including the enabling of Epstein's criminal enterprise and the lack of accountability for those involved.
