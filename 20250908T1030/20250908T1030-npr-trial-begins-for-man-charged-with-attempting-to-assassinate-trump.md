## Article summary
The trial of Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course in 2024, begins with jury selection on Monday. Routh faces charges including attempted assassination of a presidential candidate and federal weapons violations, with a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted. A Secret Service agent reported seeing a gun barrel and firing at the suspect, later identified as Routh, who fled and was arrested. Routh has a criminal record, including a conviction for possessing an explosive device, and has expressed regret for supporting Trump in 2016. The case is presided over by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who previously dismissed charges against Trump in a classified documents case. Routh, representing himself, has clashed with Judge Cannon over evidence and subpoenas, including a request to subpoena Trump, which was denied. A key piece of evidence is an SKS-style rifle found near the golf course, with prosecutors asserting its functionality and Routh's intent to harm Trump. Prosecutors argue that Routh's alleged intent is the focus, not the gun's functionality. The trial's opening statements are scheduled for Thursday.
