## Article summary
South Korea will bring home 300 workers detained in a massive raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. The South Korean government announced that negotiations with the U.S. for their release have been finalized. A charter plane will be sent to bring the workers home once administrative steps are completed. South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun is traveling to the U.S. for talks related to the workers' release. The raid, part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda, detained 475 people, mostly South Korean nationals. The operation targeted a Hyundai plant under construction, where batteries for electric vehicles are produced. The raid has caused concern in South Korea, as the country is a key U.S. ally. President Trump suggested training U.S. citizens through South Korean workers. South Korea has expressed concern over the infringement of its nationals' rights and sent diplomats to the site. Most detainees were taken to an immigration detention center, with none charged with crimes yet. The investigation is ongoing, with some workers found to have illegally crossed the border or overstayed their visas.
