## Article summary
President Trump has walked back his threat to 'go to war' with American cities, instead vowing to 'clean them up.' He mentioned this in response to a question about his plan to deploy the National Guard to cities like Chicago to help fight crime or assist with deportations. Trump's initial post on Truth Social referenced the Vietnam War film 'Apocalypse Now' and featured an image of him as a character from the movie, which sparked criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. Both Democrats condemned Trump's remarks, with Pritzker calling them a threat and Johnson stating that Trump wants to occupy Chicago and break the Constitution. Despite claims of declining crime rates in Chicago, Trump insists federal help is needed. He has also threatened to send troops to Baltimore and New Orleans, all heavily Democratic cities. Legal challenges have arisen over Trump's use of the National Guard in cities that didn't request them, with a federal judge recently ruling his deployment in Los Angeles illegal. In August, Trump asserted federal control over the D.C. police force and deployed the National Guard there. Protests in Chicago over the weekend saw marchers chanting slogans against Trump's plan, with participants emphasizing their commitment to standing up against the administration's policies.
