## Article summary
A New Zealand father, Tom Phllps, evaded authorities with his three children for nearly four years before being shot and killed by police. The confrontation occurred after Phllps robbed an agricultural supplies store, during which a police officer was critically injured. One child was with Phllps at the time and was taken into custody, while the other two children were found unaccompanied in a remote forest camp hours later. The children, now aged about 9, 10, and 11, had been missing since December 2021, with limited sightings and no formal education or healthcare during their time in hiding. Authorities believed Phllps had help concealing his family, and a substantial reward was offered for information about their whereabouts. This was not the first time Phllps had disappeared with his children, as a similar incident occurred in September 2021. The children's mother expressed relief that the ordeal had ended and looked forward to welcoming them home.
