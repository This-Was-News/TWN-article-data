## Article summary
Argentine President Javier Milei suffered a significant setback in the Buenos Aires provincial election, losing by a 13-point margin to the left-leaning Peronist opposition, which secured 47% of the vote. Milei acknowledged the defeat and vowed to learn from political mistakes while continuing his economic overhaul. The election results are seen as a crucial indicator ahead of the congressional midterms in October. Analysts had expected a narrower loss, but the outcome raises concerns about Milei's ability to stabilize the economy and gain investor confidence. The Peronists, led by former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, celebrated the victory, with Fernández taunting Milei on social media. Milei's government has implemented harsh austerity measures to combat inflation and secure an IMF bailout, but economic recovery has yet to materialize, with rising unemployment and falling consumer confidence. The election also highlighted the influence of Fernández and the potential rise of Axel Kicillof, the governor of Buenos Aires province, as a future Peronist leader. Kicillof criticized Milei's policies, emphasizing the importance of public works and social services.
