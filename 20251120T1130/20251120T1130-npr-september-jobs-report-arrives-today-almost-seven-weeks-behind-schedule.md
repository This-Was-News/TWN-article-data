## Article summary
The September jobs report, delayed by a government shutdown, is being released almost seven weeks late. This report, though somewhat stale, is expected to provide insights into the U.S. job market's strength or weakness. The report covers a period following a sluggish summer with low average job growth. Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller expressed concerns that the job market is nearing a stall, citing conversations with business leaders who are starting to plan for layoffs. Major companies like Amazon and Verizon have already announced significant job cuts. Waller advocates for interest rate cuts to stimulate demand and support the labor market, but there is internal disagreement at the Fed regarding rate policy, with some members favoring holding rates steady due to inflation exceeding the Fed's target. President Trump's tariffs are cited as a contributing factor to persistent inflation. The government shutdown has also impacted the availability of subsequent economic data, including October and November reports. Despite the lack of complete data, Fed policymakers are relying on anecdotal evidence from businesses about cautious consumer spending, particularly among low- and middle-income households. The report will also update the unemployment rate, which was 4.3% in August. Analysts debate whether the hiring slowdown is primarily due to a reduced supply of workers, driven by immigration policies and retirements, or a declining demand for labor, which Waller fears is the more significant issue.
