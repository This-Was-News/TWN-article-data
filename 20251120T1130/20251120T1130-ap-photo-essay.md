## Article summary
Christy Morrill, a 72-year-old man from California, experienced a year of profound memory loss and confusion due to autoimmune encephalitis, a condition where the immune system attacks the brain. His "year of unraveling" began with forgetting a simple bike ride with friends. Despite early diagnosis and treatment with steroids and antiseizure medication, Morrill lost decades of autobiographical memories, struggling to recall significant life events like his son's wedding. He found solace and a way to process his experience through writing haiku, documenting his fight against delusions and memory gaps. Although he has regained normal daily functioning and is making new memories, he continues to grieve the loss of past ones. Morrill's story highlights the bizarre and devastating impact of autoimmune diseases on the brain and the ongoing challenges in diagnosis and recovery. Doctors are improving their ability to identify these conditions by discovering new rogue antibodies responsible. While some patients fully recover, Morrill's case illustrates the lasting effects, even with treatment. He now focuses on creating new memories with his family and enjoying life, expressing a desire simply "to be alive."
