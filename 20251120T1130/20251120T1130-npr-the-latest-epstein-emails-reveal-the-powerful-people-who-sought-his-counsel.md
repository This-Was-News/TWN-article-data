## Article summary
The latest emails from Jeffrey Epstein's estate reveal communications with a wide range of influential figures in politics, academia, and business, even after he registered as a sex offender. These newly released documents, totaling approximately 23,000, show Epstein's continued engagement with prominent individuals from both major political parties. Among those mentioned are linguist Noam Chomsky, who wrote a letter of recommendation for Epstein, and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who received advice from Epstein on building a political movement. Former Harvard president and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is also documented having personal conversations with Epstein. The emails also reference Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel under Obama, and President Trump himself, who is mentioned over a thousand times, primarily in the context of Epstein's interest in his presidency. President Trump has called for an investigation into Democrats and financial institutions named in Epstein's communications. Republicans are also highlighting Epstein's communication with Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett. Some of Epstein's accusers are urging for a non-partisan approach to the investigation. The Epstein Files Transparency Act mandates the Attorney General to make unclassified records available within 30 days, though certain information may be withheld or redacted to protect ongoing investigations or prosecutions.
