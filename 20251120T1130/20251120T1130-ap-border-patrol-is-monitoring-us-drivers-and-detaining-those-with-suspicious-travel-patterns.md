## Article summary
The U.S. Border Patrol is employing a secretive nationwide program that monitors millions of American drivers by analyzing their travel patterns and detaining those deemed suspicious. This initiative utilizes license plate readers and algorithms to flag vehicles based on origin, destination, and routes taken, often leading to traffic stops for minor infractions that serve as pretexts for searches. The program has expanded significantly over the last five years, extending Border Patrol's surveillance capabilities into the country's interior, far beyond its traditional border jurisdiction. Information is gathered from various sources, including federal agencies like the DEA, private companies, and local law enforcement, often funded by federal grants. This has led to concerns about mass surveillance and potential violations of constitutional rights, as individuals are stopped and questioned without knowing they were targeted due to their travel data. While Border Patrol states the program is governed by strict policies for security purposes, legal scholars question the constitutionality of such large-scale digital surveillance networks. The AP's investigation, based on interviews with former officials and review of numerous documents, reveals the extensive and often hidden nature of this surveillance system, including disguised cameras and the use of informal communication channels between agencies. Examples highlight instances where innocent individuals were detained and searched based on vague suspicions derived from their travel data, raising questions about the program's effectiveness and fairness.
