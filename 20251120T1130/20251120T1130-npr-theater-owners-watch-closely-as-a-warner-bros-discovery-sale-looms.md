## Article summary
Warner Bros. Discovery, a legendary film studio with a rich history dating back to its founding by the Warner brothers in 1923, is currently up for sale, with non-binding bids being accepted until Thursday and a decision expected by Christmas. The company, which has expanded to include streaming services and cable channels, has a vast library of iconic films and cartoons. Recent mergers in the industry, such as Disney's acquisition of Fox, have led to a significant reduction in the number of films released theatrically, a trend that deeply concerns theater owners. These owners are grappling with the ongoing consolidation of studios and the rise of streaming, and are hoping that a new owner of Warner Bros. Discovery will prioritize making movies for cinemas. Speculation about potential buyers includes rivals like Paramount, streaming giant Netflix, or other major players like Comcast and Amazon. However, Netflix has stated it has no interest in owning legacy media networks. Theater owners and industry watchers are worried that a new owner might focus only on big-budget blockbusters, potentially sidelining independent films and new filmmakers. They emphasize the importance of studios continuing to fund and support original, creative works, citing Warner Bros.' recent string of critical hits as an example of the value of such risk-taking.
