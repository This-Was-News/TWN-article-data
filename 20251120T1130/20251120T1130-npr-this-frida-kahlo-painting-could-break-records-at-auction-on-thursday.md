## Article summary
A 1940 Frida Kahlo painting, "El sueño (La cama)," is expected to fetch between $40 and $60 million at a Sotheby's auction on Thursday night, potentially setting a new record for the most expensive artwork by a woman. This sale comes at a time when art markets are softening, yet Kahlo's work maintains a strong appeal, placing her in the league of superstar artists like Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. The painting, described by Sotheby's as a "greatest masterwork" showcasing her surrealist piece, fuses dream imagery with intense emotion. Its estimated price could surpass the 2014 record of $44.4 million set by Georgia O'Keeffe's "Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1." Kahlo's previous auction record was $34.9 million in 2021 for "Diego y yo." Her mystique stems from psychologically complex self-portraits addressing her disabilities, heritage, and connection to the world, documented with searing candor and surreal elements. Kahlo's enduring power is evident in numerous museum exhibitions and immersive experiences worldwide over the past year, with major retrospectives opening in Houston and London, and a new museum dedicated to her early life in Mexico City.
