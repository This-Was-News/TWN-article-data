## Article summary
President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to U.S. cities are facing increasing resistance in the courts. A Tennessee judge recently issued a temporary block on the state's use of the Guard in Memphis, following similar legal challenges in other cities. This ruling in Tennessee was based on the argument that the state's constitution requires a "rebellion or invasion" for such deployments, criteria the plaintiffs argued were not met. The judge stated that the governor's power as commander-in-chief is not unlimited. While the Tennessee governor plans to appeal, the legal battles highlight a broader tension between executive authority and constitutional checks and balances. Experts view these court decisions as evidence that the system of checks and balances is functioning, preventing lawless use of the military in domestic situations. Some legal experts suggest that the Supreme Court may ultimately have to weigh in on these deployment disputes. The Trump administration, however, has expressed disagreement with the rulings, calling them misunderstandings of the law. Despite these legal challenges, Trump has continued to suggest troop deployments to other cities and has hinted at invoking the Insurrection Act. Ultimately, public sentiment may serve as a significant check on the president's power regarding military deployments.
