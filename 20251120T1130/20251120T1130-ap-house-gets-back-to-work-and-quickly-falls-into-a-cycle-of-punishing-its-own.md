## Article summary
The U.S. House of Representatives has returned to session, but its legislative agenda is being overshadowed by a surge of censures, reprimands, and investigations targeting its own members. This focus on internal disciplinary actions leaves little time for addressing pressing issues like healthcare premiums and government funding. Democrats express concern that this cycle of punishment distracts from the needs of the American people. Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership is being tested as rank-and-file members use procedural tools to push their agendas. Efforts to censure Representative Stacey Plaskett failed, while Representative Cory Mills faces an Ethics Committee investigation following a censure attempt. Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick is also indicted on charges of stealing federal disaster funds. These disruptions have become a regular feature of the House, with some lawmakers viewing it as the 'new normal' where little substantive legislation is passed. The use of tools like the discharge petition allows members to force votes on issues, even against party leadership's wishes, as seen with the Epstein files legislation. This environment of constant scrutiny and internal conflict leaves crucial legislative tasks, such as averting a government shutdown and addressing healthcare costs, in jeopardy.
