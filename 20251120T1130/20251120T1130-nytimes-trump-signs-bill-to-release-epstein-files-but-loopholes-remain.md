## Article summary
President Trump has signed legislation compelling the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days. This action comes after significant pressure, with Trump seeking credit for the bill's passage. However, the legislation includes exceptions, such as for ongoing investigations, which could result in some documents remaining confidential. Trump used his social media platform to criticize Democrats, suggesting they are using the Epstein issue as a distraction from his administration's achievements. He claimed he directed Republican leaders in the House and Senate to pass the bill, leading to near-unanimous votes. This assertion contradicts the reality that the bill's passage was forced by House Democrats and a few Republicans against Trump's initial wishes. Other Republicans signaled their support as the vote approached. One of the first abuse survivors to report Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Maria Farmer, welcomed the development.
