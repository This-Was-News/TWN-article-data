## Article summary
Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former university president, is stepping down from his teaching duties and his role as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School. This decision comes as Harvard investigates his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Summers' spokesman confirmed the move, stating that co-teachers will complete his current classes and he was not scheduled to teach next semester. He will retain his tenured status at Harvard during this period. This development follows Summers' recent resignation from the board of OpenAI, where he was instrumental in stabilizing the company after a leadership dispute. Revelations of a close relationship between Summers and Epstein, including exchanged emails after Epstein's jail time for sex crimes with minors, prompted increased scrutiny. Summers has expressed regret over his continued association with Epstein. He has also severed ties with two think tanks and The New York Times Opinion section will not renew his contract as a contributing writer. Senator Elizabeth Warren had previously urged Harvard to cut ties with Summers. Videos show Summers acknowledging his regret to students regarding his communications with Epstein, though he initially stated an intention to fulfill teaching obligations.
