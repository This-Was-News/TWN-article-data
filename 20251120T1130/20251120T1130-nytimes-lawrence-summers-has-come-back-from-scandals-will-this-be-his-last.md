## Article summary
Lawrence H. Summers, a prominent economist and former Harvard president, has long maintained a role as an omnipresent public intellectual. Despite a history of controversy, he has consistently reappeared in public life through media appearances and elite forums. However, recent revelations concerning his association with Jeffrey Epstein may threaten this omnipresence. Thousands of Epstein's communications, released by Congress, have brought to light Summers' "chumminess" with the disgraced financier. Consequently, Summers has lost his teaching position at Harvard and board memberships, including one at OpenAI. Harvard is also reviewing its connections with Epstein, prompted by these revelations. While Summers remains a tenured professor, making removal difficult, his situation is being closely watched. This scandal could test the trend of public rehabilitation for powerful men facing career-threatening controversies, given the severity of Epstein's crimes. The fallout for Summers may indicate how such revelations impact others as more information about Epstein's network emerges.
