## Article summary
The U.S. Coast Guard is actively pursuing an oil tanker, the Bella 1, linked to Venezuela, which is attempting to flee in the Caribbean Sea. This action is part of President Trump's intensified pressure campaign against the Venezuelan government. The Bella 1, previously sanctioned for transporting Iranian oil, was not carrying cargo and was not flying a valid national flag when U.S. forces attempted to intercept it with a seizure warrant. The tanker refused to be boarded, leading to an active pursuit. Earlier on the same day, the Coast Guard successfully boarded another tanker, the Centuries, which had recently departed Venezuela with oil. While the Centuries did not appear on the U.S. sanctions list, its Panamanian registration was being investigated. These maritime actions represent a significant escalation, potentially increasing the risk of confrontation as Venezuela has ordered its navy to escort oil tankers. The U.S. aims to squeeze Venezuela's vital oil trade, which the administration claims is used to finance illicit activities. The targeted ships are part of a larger 'ghost fleet' that operates in violation of sanctions, often disguising their movements. The U.S. has previously seized another tanker, the Skipper, for similar reasons related to its involvement with Iranian oil.
