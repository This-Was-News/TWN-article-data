## Article summary
Walmart and other major US companies are facing a significant shortage of skilled tradespeople, a problem exacerbated by a wave of retirements and a slowdown in immigration. This deficit impacts essential operations, from maintaining distribution center equipment to ensuring refrigerated grocery cases function properly. In response, Walmart has revamped its training programs to cultivate its own workforce of maintenance technicians. For instance, Liz Cardenas, a 24-year-old technician, nearly doubled her hourly pay and gained financial independence through Walmart's program. McKinsey & Company predicts a severe imbalance of 20 job openings for every new employee in trade categories by 2032, potentially costing companies billions annually. Business Roundtable has launched an initiative, co-championed by Lowes, to address these shortages by raising awareness in schools. Lowes also offers its own training programs and invests in technical colleges. Experts believe these efforts will help but not eliminate the gap, especially with current immigration policies. Walmart aims to train 4,000 workers by 2030 through its tuition-free initiative, which combines hands-on and classroom learning. The company emphasizes the importance of these roles, noting that a refrigeration system failure could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost product.
