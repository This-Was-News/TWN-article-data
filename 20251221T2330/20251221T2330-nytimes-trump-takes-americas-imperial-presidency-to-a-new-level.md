## Article summary
Donald Trump's second term as president has ushered in a new, more audacious version of the "imperial presidency," exceeding even the power asserted by Richard Nixon. This transformation is evident in both his use of royal pageantry, such as elaborate state dinners and military displays mirroring those of monarchies, and his accumulation of virtually unbridled power with minimal resistance from Congress or the Supreme Court. Unlike his first term, Trump 2.0 is characterized by a clear plan to remake the country, surrounded by loyalists rather than restraining advisors. This assertion of power is seen by supporters as invigorating in a country they perceive as declining, while critics view it as narcissistic and dangerous to democracy. Despite his consistent unpopularity, Trump dominates the political landscape, setting the agenda and forcing his will upon the system. Presidents have historically pushed the boundaries of power, but Trump has consistently bypassed limits, even those that previously restrained executives. His administration has been marked by a strategy of "everything-everywhere-all-at-once," utilizing executive orders extensively and surrounding himself with "yes men." This unchecked power has also allowed for unprecedented profit-making by his family. While historical precedent suggests a potential for the presidency to cycle back, the long-term implications of Trump's "imperial" approach remain uncertain, with signs of resistance emerging but the ultimate endurance of these changes yet to be determined.
