## Article summary
The Turning Point USA's AmericaFest convention highlighted internal divisions within the Republican Party as it contemplates a future without Donald Trump. Despite the organization's powerful youth network endorsing Vice President JD Vance as the potential 2028 nominee, the gathering revealed a fracturing MAGA movement with various factions vying for influence. Vance advocated for an inclusive approach, rejecting "purity tests" and welcoming diverse viewpoints within the movement. However, debates arose regarding the inclusion of controversial figures like antisemitic podcaster Nick Fuentes, showcasing the ideological rifts. Commentator Tucker Carlson questioned who would control the Republican Party's machinery post-Trump, while Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet framed the discord as healthy debate. While Vance received support from many attendees and figures like Nicki Minaj and Donald Trump Jr., some, like Senator Rand Paul, expressed dissent, arguing Vance deviates from traditional Republican principles. The future of the party remains uncertain, complicated by Trump's occasional musings about a third term and the ongoing struggle to define its identity.
