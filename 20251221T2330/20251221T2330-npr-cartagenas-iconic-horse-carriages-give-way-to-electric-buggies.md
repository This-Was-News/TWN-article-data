## Article summary
Cartagena, Colombia, is phasing out its iconic horse-drawn carriages, a move that has sparked division within the historic city. The city government plans to replace the traditional buggies with electric vehicles, citing concerns over animal welfare. Animal rights activists have long advocated for this change, pointing to instances of horses collapsing from exhaustion and suffering injuries from the city's paved roads. Traditional horse cart drivers and owners, however, feel this decision erodes the city's heritage and threatens their livelihoods. They argue that the horse carts are an integral part of Cartagena's identity and charm for tourists. Efforts have been made to develop electric buggies that mimic the appearance of the horse-drawn carriages, powered by batteries and charged using solar energy. Despite the city's investment in a new fleet of 62 electric carriages, negotiations with current horse cart owners regarding compensation and inclusion in the new system remain contentious. While some drivers are open to operating the electric buggies, others fear the loss of tradition will deter tourists, questioning if the new vehicles can replicate the authentic experience.
