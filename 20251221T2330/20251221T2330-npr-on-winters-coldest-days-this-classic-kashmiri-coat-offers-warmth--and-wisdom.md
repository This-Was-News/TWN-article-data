## Article summary
The traditional Kashmiri winter coat, the pheran, offers more than just warmth; it symbolizes ingenuity and resilience. During the harsh 40-day winter period known as Chillai Kalan, the pheran, often used with a kangri (a pot of embers), represents a solution developed from available resources. This wisdom is relevant to modern global health challenges, where technological solutions are often prioritized without fully understanding local contexts. The author draws parallels with successful health initiatives in Rwanda and Kenya, highlighting how these innovations succeeded by integrating with existing technologies and understanding community needs. In Rwanda, the Babyl platform utilizes basic mobile technology to provide virtual healthcare, while in Kenya, Rology's teleradiology platform addresses the shortage of radiologists by connecting hospitals with specialists. These examples underscore the importance of deep community understanding and empathy as the foundation for meaningful innovation, rather than just deploying advanced technology. The core lesson is that communities facing hardship often possess inherent wisdom and have developed their own effective systems for problem-solving, which should be respected and built upon.
