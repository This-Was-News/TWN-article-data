## Article summary
Millions of Americans are facing higher costs for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans in 2026 due to premium increases and the expiration of enhanced tax subsidies. While some are exploring cheaper alternatives, these options come with significant trade-offs. Short-term insurance plans, often less expensive, are not ACA-compliant and can exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions, impose benefit caps, and may not cover essential health benefits like maternity care or prescription drugs. Other non-comprehensive options include indemnity plans, which supplement traditional insurance but typically fall short of covering full costs, and faith-based sharing plans, which are not guaranteed to cover expenses and are not considered insurance. For those staying within ACA plans, "Bronze" or "Catastrophic" plans offer lower premiums but come with very high deductibles, potentially making them unaffordable for low-income individuals. Shopping around for different ACA plans, even from the same insurer, or exploring small group plans for business owners with few employees, might yield lower premiums. It is crucial for consumers to use official ACA marketplace websites to avoid scams and to understand the limitations of any plan before enrolling. The deadline for open enrollment is January 15 for coverage starting February 1, and consumers must pay their first premium for coverage to begin.
