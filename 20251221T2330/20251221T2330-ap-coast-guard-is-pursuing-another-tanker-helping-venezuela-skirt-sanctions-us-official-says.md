## Article summary
The U.S. Coast Guard is actively pursuing another sanctioned oil tanker in the Caribbean Sea, as the Trump administration intensifies its efforts to target vessels involved in Venezuela's sanctions evasion. This pursuit follows the recent seizure of a tanker, the "Centuries," on Saturday, which the White House described as part of Venezuela's "shadow fleet" used to traffic stolen oil. A U.S. official confirmed that Sunday's pursuit involves a vessel flying a false flag under a judicial seizure order, operating to circumvent sanctions. Previously, on December 10th, the Coast Guard, with Navy assistance, seized the "Skipper," another tanker operating on the fringes of the law. President Trump has escalated his rhetoric towards Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, demanding the return of assets seized from U.S. oil companies and reiterating his blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers. These actions are partly motivated by disputes over oil investments and accusations of drug trafficking, with some sanctioned tankers already diverting from Venezuela. Venezuelan President Maduro has denounced these actions as "corsairs attacking oil tankers." However, some U.S. lawmakers, like Senator Rand Paul, have criticized the seizures as provocations that could lead to war. The targeting of tankers coincides with U.S. military strikes on vessels accused of smuggling drugs, which have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and human rights activists over a lack of evidence and potential extrajudicial killings. Democrats, such as Senator Tim Kaine, have urged for congressional authorization for military actions and emphasized the use of sanctions over waging war without a congressional vote.
