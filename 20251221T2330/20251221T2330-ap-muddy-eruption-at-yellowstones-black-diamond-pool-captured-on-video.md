## Article summary
Volcanic experts from the U.S. Geological Survey have captured video of a muddy eruption at Yellowstone National Park's Black Diamond Pool. The eruption, described as "Kablooey!" by experts, occurred on Saturday morning, with mud spraying from the pool. This event was clearly visible due to clear skies and snowy surroundings, unlike previous eruptions that were often obscured by darkness or ice. Black Diamond Pool has a history of hydrothermal explosions, with a significant one in July 2024 that damaged a boardwalk and led to area closures. Since then, smaller muddy eruptions, reaching up to 40 feet, have occurred sporadically. Researchers have recently installed new monitoring equipment, including cameras and seismic sensors, to better detect and analyze these events. Experts note that there is no discernible pattern or precursor to these eruptions. Yellowstone National Park is renowned for its vast collection of hydrothermal features, including over 10,000 hot springs, geysers, and mud pots.
