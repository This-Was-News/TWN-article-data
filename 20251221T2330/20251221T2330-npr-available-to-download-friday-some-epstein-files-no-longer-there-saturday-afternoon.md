## Article summary
The Department of Justice began releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal investigations on Friday, posting them to its "Epstein Library" website. By Saturday afternoon, NPR analysis revealed that over a dozen files initially available were no longer accessible. These removed documents included a photograph of President Trump's picture on a desk and various artworks. The DOJ stated that it aims to redact personal information and protect sensitive materials, but acknowledged that inadvertently included content might exist. The removal of Trump's photo was clarified as a temporary measure due to a request from the Southern District of New York, and it was later reposted after review. Some members of Congress have expressed concerns about the completeness of the released files, with Representative Ro Khanna highlighting the need for accountability for powerful individuals involved. Representative Thomas Massie criticized the redactions as failing to comply with the law. While Trump's name and image appear infrequently in the newly released documents, he was a more frequent subject in previous Epstein file tranches released by the House Democratic Oversight Committee.
