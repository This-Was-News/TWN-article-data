## Article summary
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche defended the Justice Department's partial release of Jeffrey Epstein files, stating it was necessary to protect survivors of sexual abuse. The release, mandated by law, occurred on a deadline, but Democrats accuse the Trump administration of trying to hide information. Blanche asserted that the department is obligated to proceed with caution due to sensitive information within the documents. He argued that those criticizing the partial release are the same ones who would not want victims' information compromised. The partial release included photographs, transcripts, and court records, but lacked crucial FBI interviews and internal memos that could explain charging decisions. President Trump, who was previously friends with Epstein, had sought to keep records sealed. Democrats, however, view the partial release as a cover-up, with some suggesting impeachment proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi for failing to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Blanche dismissed impeachment talk, asserting the department is complying with the statute. He also explained the removal of certain files, including a photograph of Trump with Epstein, was due to the presence of victims' images, and they would be reposted after redactions. The Justice Department continues to review documents and has identified more potential victims. Blanche also defended the transfer of Ghislaine Maxwell to a less restrictive prison due to safety concerns.
