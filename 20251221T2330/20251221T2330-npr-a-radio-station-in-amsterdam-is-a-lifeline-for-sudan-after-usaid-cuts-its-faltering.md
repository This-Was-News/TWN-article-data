## Article summary
Radio Dabanga, an independent Sudanese news station broadcasting from Amsterdam since 2008, is facing an uncertain future due to significant budget cuts from USAID, which previously funded over half of its nearly $3 million budget. This reduction has forced the station to cut staff and services, impacting its ability to provide crucial information to Sudanese listeners. In Sudan, a devastating civil war has destroyed approximately 90% of media infrastructure, leaving millions without reliable news. Listeners in refugee camps and war-torn regions have expressed their deep reliance on Radio Dabanga as their sole source of verified information about their families and the ongoing crisis. The station reports on fighting, disease outbreaks, and atrocities, serving as a vital link to the outside world. Despite the challenges, efforts are underway to raise funds, including a recent event in Amsterdam, to bridge the station's substantial budget shortfall. The survival of Radio Dabanga is critical, as the loss of this information lifeline could have dire consequences for many Sudanese people during the ongoing conflict.
