## Article summary
House Speaker Mike Johnson has unveiled a Republican health care plan, a last-minute effort as enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year. The GOP proposal, set for a vote next week, focuses on expanding access to employer-sponsored health insurance and regulating pharmacy benefit managers to control drug costs. However, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has criticized the plan as "toxic" and unserious, stating he will strongly oppose it if it reaches the House floor. The Republican package does not include an extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits, which a significant number of families rely on to afford coverage. President Donald Trump has reiterated his long-standing promise of a better health care plan than Obamacare, suggesting direct stipends to individuals rather than extending current subsidies. Meanwhile, a group of centrist House Republicans is collaborating with Democrats to push for extensions of the ACA subsidies through discharge petitions, a procedural move to force a vote. One such petition, filed by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, proposes a two-year subsidy extension with anti-fraud measures and PBM restrictions. Another, from Rep. Josh Gottheimer, seeks a one-year extension with income caps. Democratic leaders are reviewing these bipartisan efforts, while also pursuing their own clean three-year subsidy extension proposal that currently lacks Republican support. The Senate previously failed to advance both Republican and Democratic health care proposals, leaving Congress with limited time to find a consensus solution before the year ends.
