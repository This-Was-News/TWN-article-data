## Article summary
Nearly a year into his second term, President Trump is struggling to connect with voters on economic issues, as Americans face persistent cost-of-living pressures despite his claims of a booming economy. While Trump has defended his economic policies and attributed affordability concerns to a Democratic "hoax," polls indicate a significant portion of the population remains unconvinced. The White House has attempted to address this disconnect by rolling out a $12 billion farmer aid package and having the President make public appearances to champion his economic agenda. However, Trump's dismissive tone towards voters' economic anxieties and his administration's reluctance to acknowledge the impact of policies like tariffs have contributed to a messaging gap. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that media coverage is influencing public perception, while economists note that voters may not respond well to arguments about their own economic circumstances. Despite some positive economic indicators like falling gas prices and wages outpacing inflation, other factors, such as elevated inflation, are causing voter pain. The administration often blames the "embedded inflation from the Biden years" for current economic woes. Economists suggest potential solutions like mitigating Obamacare premiums or removing tariffs, but the White House maintains its current policies will ultimately prove beneficial.
