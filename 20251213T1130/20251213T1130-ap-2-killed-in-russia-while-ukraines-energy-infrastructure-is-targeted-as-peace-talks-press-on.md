## Article summary
At least two people were killed in a drone attack in Russia's southwestern Saratov region, with authorities reporting damage to a residential building, kindergarten, and clinic. Russia's defense ministry stated it had shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight. Simultaneously, parts of Ukraine experienced power outages following targeted Russian drone and missile strikes on energy and port infrastructure across five regions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that Russia launched over 450 drones and 30 missiles, leaving thousands without electricity. An attack on Odesa caused grain silos to catch fire at the port, and two people were wounded in the wider region. Kyiv and its allies accuse Russia of attempting to cripple Ukraine's power grid and deprive civilians of essential services. These attacks occur as U.S.-led peace talks continue, with a Kremlin official stating Russian police and National Guard will remain in eastern Ukraine's Donbas postwar, regardless of a peace settlement. Moscow has indicated a ceasefire is contingent on Ukrainian forces withdrawing from the front line. Germany is scheduled to host Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for talks as peace efforts gain momentum, though negotiations face significant obstacles regarding the status of Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.
