## Article summary
Senator Marco Rubio has long viewed Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, as a key ally of Cuba, and believes that ousting Maduro could critically weaken the Cuban government. This perspective stems from Rubio's Cuban heritage and his long-standing opposition to the Castro regime and its allies. A 2019 attempt to remove Maduro failed, partly due to Cuban intervention, which reinforced Rubio's belief in the strong Venezuela-Cuba connection. The U.S. policy, particularly under Rubio's influence, has escalated military pressure and sanctions against Venezuela, aiming to force Maduro out. This strategy is seen by some as a direct effort to destabilize Cuba, which relies on Venezuela for economic support, including oil. While the Trump administration has framed these actions partly as a crackdown on drug trafficking, Cuba hawks like Rubio see it as an opportunity to strike a blow against Havana. Critics, however, warn that regime change policies are costly and have a history of failure, and that Cuba's resilience is underestimated. The partnership between Venezuela and Cuba originated under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro, involving an oil-for-security pact. Despite diminished Venezuelan support due to U.S. sanctions, Cuba remains determined to protect Maduro, fearing his downfall could threaten its own regime. For Rubio, seeing Cuba's government crumble would be a lifelong dream, rooted in his family's experience fleeing Castro's revolution.
