## Article summary
Venezuelan Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado was whisked out of the country in a daring nighttime maritime operation orchestrated by U.S. veterans from the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation. Machado had been in hiding for over a year after her opposition movement's electoral victory, which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro refused to acknowledge, leading to a crackdown. The extraction, codenamed Operation Golden Dynamite, was planned within a week due to Machado's high profile. A sea route was chosen to avoid checkpoints, but the team had to navigate carefully to avoid being mistaken for narco-traffickers targeted by the U.S. military. A planned rendezvous at sea was aborted when Machado's boat did not arrive, forcing the rescue team to pivot and find her. The transfer occurred in darkness amidst 10-foot waves, with both crews initially wary of each other. Machado, despite the perilous conditions, remained composed, impressing the veterans who assisted her. She was then transported by private plane to Oslo to accept her Nobel Peace Prize. The operation highlighted the challenges and risks involved in extracting high-profile figures from politically volatile regions.
