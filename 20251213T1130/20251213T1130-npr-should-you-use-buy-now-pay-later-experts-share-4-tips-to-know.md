## Article summary
The "How to use buy now, pay later responsibly" article from NPR discusses the increasing popularity of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services, especially among online shoppers. While BNPL offers a convenient way to finance purchases, it functions as a form of credit and carries risks if not managed responsibly. Experts advise consumers to only use BNPL if they are certain they can afford the full repayment, as missed payments can negatively impact credit scores and lead to debt collection. It is crucial to avoid taking out multiple BNPL loans simultaneously, as this can make it difficult to track payments and potentially lead to overdraft fees or budget shortfalls. The article also warns against using BNPL as an enabler of impulse shopping, urging consumers to consider the long-term financial implications of their purchases. Finally, it highlights that BNPL loans may not offer the same purchase protections, such as chargeback rights, as traditional credit cards, leaving consumers potentially liable for issues with orders.
