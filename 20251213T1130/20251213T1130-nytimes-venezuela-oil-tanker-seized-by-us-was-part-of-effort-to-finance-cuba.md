## Article summary
The U.S. seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela that was part of the Venezuelan government's effort to support Cuba. The tanker, Skipper, departed Venezuela on December 4th with nearly two million barrels of crude oil destined for the Cuban port of Matanzas. A small portion of the oil was transferred to another ship, Neptune 6, which then proceeded towards Cuba. The majority of the oil remained on the Skipper as it headed east. Venezuelan leaders Nicolás Maduro and Hugo Chávez have a long history of sending subsidized oil to Cuba. In exchange, Cuba has provided Venezuela with medical professionals, sports instructors, and security personnel. This exchange has become particularly vital for Maduro, who relies on Cuban bodyguards and counterintelligence officers for his protection amidst U.S. military presence in the Caribbean.
