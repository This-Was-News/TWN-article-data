## Article summary
David Sacks, President Trump's top advisor on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency policy, is facing scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest stemming from his extensive investments in the tech sector. Critics argue that ethics waivers granted to Sacks allow him to shape U.S. policy while retaining hundreds of investments in AI-related firms, with some experts calling these waivers "sham ethics waivers" that enable him to profit from his government position. This controversy coincides with Sacks' role in shaping a controversial executive order aimed at challenging state AI laws deemed burdensome by the industry, a move supported by many in Silicon Valley but opposed by some within the MAGA movement who distrust the tech elite. Sacks defends his position, stating he has divested significant holdings and that the Office of Government Ethics approved his waivers, concluding no conflicts of interest exist. He also claims serving in his role has cost him substantial personal wealth. Meanwhile, concerns are being raised about the potential for a taxpayer bailout of the tech industry if the current AI investment bubble bursts, drawing parallels to Sacks' advocacy for a government rescue of Silicon Valley Bank in the past. Sacks has offered mixed signals on the possibility of a federal bailout for AI companies, stating there won't be one while also acknowledging that a reversal in AI investments could risk recession.
