## Article summary
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case drew attention to President Trump's immigration policies, has been released from immigration detention. A federal judge has temporarily blocked further detention efforts for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen with a U.S. wife and child who has resided in Maryland for years. Despite a 2019 court order granting him protection from deportation to El Salvador due to a well-founded fear of danger, the Trump administration has sought to deport him to various African nations. Abrego Garcia is contesting his deportation in federal court, alleging the administration is retaliating against him for a previous legal victory. He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and held in a Salvadoran prison, only to be returned to the U.S. in June. Subsequently, he faced human smuggling charges in Tennessee and was released on home detention, but was then taken into immigration custody. A judge ruled that a procedural error in his 2019 immigration case means there is no final order of removal, preventing his deportation for now. The government could appeal this ruling, or Abrego Garcia's case could be reopened in immigration court, which presents its own challenges. Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia maintains his innocence on the human smuggling charges, with his defense team arguing the prosecution may be vindictive, citing statements from administration officials. He is currently free, but a hearing on his status is expected soon.
