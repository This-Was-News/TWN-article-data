## Article summary
A retired Chinese official, Li Chuanliang, has found himself a fugitive hunted by Beijing after reporting his boss for corruption. Fearing extradition from South Korea, Li fled to the U.S. on a tourist visa and applied for asylum. However, the Chinese government continues to pursue him using surveillance technology, monitoring his communications, seizing assets, and detaining over 40 friends, relatives, and associates. This pursuit is part of China's broader strategy, "Operations Fox Hunt and Sky Net," which utilizes U.S.-sourced surveillance technology to track and pressure officials, dissidents, and alleged criminals abroad. The technology, including software from companies like IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft, mines various data to identify targets' networks and assets. Li claims he is being targeted for criticizing the Chinese government, while Beijing accuses him of massive corruption. Despite facing legal challenges and threats to his family, Li continues to speak out against the Chinese government's actions, highlighting the pervasive use of surveillance and the fear it instills.
