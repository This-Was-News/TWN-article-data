## Article summary
Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado undertook a perilous escape to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, though she arrived too late for the ceremony. Her daring journey involved evading military checkpoints, enduring a rough sea voyage, and relying on a private plane from a Caribbean island. The operation was orchestrated by Grey Bull Rescue, a company led by U.S. veterans with special operations and intelligence backgrounds. This was the 800th rescue mission for the Tampa-based firm, founded after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Despite their experience, Ms. Machado's high profile presented a unique challenge for the company, as their usual infrastructure is designed for less prominent individuals. While a representative confirmed Grey Bull Rescue's involvement, not all details of the escape could be independently verified. The Wall Street Journal initially reported on the escape. Ms. Machado's successful evasion highlights her continued significance in the political standoff between Venezuela and the United States.
