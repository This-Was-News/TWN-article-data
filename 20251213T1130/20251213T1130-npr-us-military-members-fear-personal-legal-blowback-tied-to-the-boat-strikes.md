## Article summary
U.S. military members, including staff officers and drone pilots, are seeking legal advice from outside groups due to concerns about potential personal blowback from lethal strikes against suspected drug boats. The administration claims these strikes, which have resulted in over 80 deaths in the past three months, are legal under the laws of war and presidential authority. However, many legal experts, including former military lawyers, argue that these actions are unlawful and could be considered murder. This legal ambiguity has left some service members worried about facing punishment for their involvement. Organizations like Quaker House and the Orders Project have received calls from service members expressing concerns about the legality of their participation and the potential moral implications. These individuals are not typically the ones directly carrying out the strikes but are involved in operational planning. They report facing pressure from superiors to approve these actions, even when they have reservations. The advice provided focuses on documenting pressure and seeking clarification, rather than determining the lawfulness of orders. Service members are worried that future consequences might be politically motivated rather than based on established law, creating a difficult and uncertain situation.
