## Article summary
House Democrats have released a selection of photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, including images of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew. These photos are part of a larger collection of over 95,000 documents received from Epstein's estate. While some photos have already been publicly circulated, Democrats intend to release more in the coming weeks. President Trump stated he had not seen the photos and considered them "no big deal," while the White House accused Democrats of creating a "false narrative." Republicans on the House Oversight Committee have threatened contempt of Congress proceedings against the Clintons if they do not testify. The released photos, which include individuals like Steve Bannon, Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Woody Allen, Larry Summers, and Alan Dershowitz, were provided without captions or context. Democrats emphasized their commitment to redacting information that could harm victims. The release comes as anticipation grows for the Department of Justice to release its own Epstein case files, which have been the subject of speculation for years. Some lawmakers believe the full release of DOJ files could implicate additional high-profile figures beyond Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
