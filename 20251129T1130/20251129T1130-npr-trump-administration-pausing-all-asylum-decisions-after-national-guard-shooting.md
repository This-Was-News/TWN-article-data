## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced a pause on all asylum decisions following a shooting incident in Washington, D.C., where an Afghan national allegedly killed one member of the National Guard and critically injured another. Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), stated that the agency is halting decisions until all individuals can be vetted to the maximum extent possible, emphasizing that the safety of Americans is the top priority. This action aligns with President Trump's recent calls for a significant reduction in immigration from countries he has labeled as "third world." Trump has expressed a desire to permanently halt migration from these nations to allow the U.S. system to recover, suggesting that "reverse migration" is the only solution. The administration is already deporting some immigrants to their home countries or to third countries that have agreed to accept them. USCIS is conducting a thorough reexamination of all Green Card applications from countries of concern, which previously included 12 nations under a White House proclamation. The Department of Homeland Security has reportedly halted all immigration requests from Afghanistan and is reviewing asylum cases approved under the previous administration. The alleged shooter, identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national who had assisted the CIA, was admitted to the U.S. in 2021. Trump has characterized the shooting as a terrorist attack and blamed the Biden administration for the individual's entry and broader immigration system failures. He has also broadened his criticism to immigrants in general, making disparaging remarks about individuals from Somalia and linking them to crime, despite acknowledging they had no direct connection to the D.C. shooting. Officials from the United Nations have criticized Trump's stance, asserting that asylum seekers are entitled to protection and due process under international law.
