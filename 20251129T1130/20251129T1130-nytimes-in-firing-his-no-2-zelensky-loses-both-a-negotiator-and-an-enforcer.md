## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his top aide, Andriy Yermak, a move that signifies a major shift in Ukraine's wartime leadership. Yermak had served as Zelensky's right-hand man, enforcing internal discipline in Ukrainian politics and leading the country's peace negotiations. His departure comes amid a corruption investigation, though Ukrainian officials maintain that the peace talks will continue unaffected. Yermak, a former movie producer, was known for his assertive political style, which drew criticism from opposition figures and journalists who accused him of repression. In diplomatic efforts, he played a central role, even leading Ukraine's delegation in recent talks with the Trump administration despite the ongoing investigation. His close proximity to Zelensky in public appearances, often in matching military attire, was a notable characteristic. While some in Ukraine welcomed his exit, the removal of the chief negotiator raises questions about the future dynamics of the peace talks. However, the core issues of security for Ukraine and Europe remain the central focus of these negotiations, regardless of personnel changes.
