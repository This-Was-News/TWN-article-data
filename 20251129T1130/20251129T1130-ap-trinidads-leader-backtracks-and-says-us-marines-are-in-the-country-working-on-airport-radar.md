## Article summary
Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has revised her earlier statement, confirming that U.S. Marines are currently in the country working on the airport's radar, runway, and road on the island of Tobago. She stated that this collaboration aims to enhance surveillance and intelligence capabilities for detecting narco-traffickers. This development follows recent U.S. military activity in the Caribbean, including ongoing strikes against suspected drug traffickers and a visit from U.S. General Dan Caine to Trinidad and Tobago. While the U.S. government's specific plans for the radar at the Tobago airport remain unclear, officials have confirmed a U.S. military plane recently landed on the island for refueling. This situation occurs amidst a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean, described as the largest in generations, which some experts believe is intended to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Earlier, the Dominican Republic granted the U.S. temporary access to facilities to aid in the fight against drug trafficking. The U.S. strikes, which began in early September, have resulted in numerous fatalities.
