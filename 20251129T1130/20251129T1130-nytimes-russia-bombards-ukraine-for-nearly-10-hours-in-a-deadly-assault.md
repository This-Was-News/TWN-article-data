## Article summary
Russia launched a devastating air assault across Ukraine lasting nearly 10 hours on Saturday, resulting in at least two deaths and dozens of injuries in the capital, Kyiv. The attack, which commenced just before midnight and concluded around 9:30 a.m., involved numerous Russian missiles and hundreds of drones. In Kyiv, emergency services responded to fires and aided the wounded in seven districts. Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported two fatalities and at least 29 injuries, a figure later revised to three deaths by President Volodymyr Zelensky, who stated that Russia targeted energy infrastructure and civilian facilities. Ukraine's Air Force indicated that Russia deployed 36 missiles and 596 attack drones, with the Kyiv region bearing the brunt of the assault. This offensive occurred amidst diplomatic efforts by the Trump administration to broker peace, a timing noted by Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, who remarked that Russia's actions demonstrate a commitment to killing and destruction rather than peace. The strikes also impacted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving over 600,000 consumers in Kyiv and its surrounding region without power.
