## Article summary
Airbus has issued an urgent call for airlines to upgrade the software on their A320 family aircraft due to a potential issue with flight controls. The manufacturer discovered that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical for flight control functions. This precautionary measure follows an analysis of an incident involving JetBlue Flight 1230, which experienced a sudden altitude drop. The Federal Aviation Administration and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency have mandated emergency airworthiness directives requiring the software update before aircraft can fly again. This widespread issue affects a significant number of the more than 9,000 A320 family planes in operation globally. The required update is occurring during a busy holiday travel period, potentially leading to operational disruptions and delays for passengers. Major airlines like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines are taking swift action to implement the fix, with American Airlines expecting most updates to be completed within two days. While some airlines anticipate minor disruptions, all are prioritizing passenger safety and working to minimize flight cancellations and delays.
