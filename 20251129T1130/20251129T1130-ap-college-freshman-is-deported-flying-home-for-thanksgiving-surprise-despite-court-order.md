## Article summary
A college freshman from Honduras, Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, was deported to her home country from Boston Logan International Airport while attempting to fly to Texas for Thanksgiving. This occurred despite a court order that was issued the day after her arrest, prohibiting her removal from the United States. Lopez Belloza, a student at Babson College, was reportedly unaware of any prior deportation order, with her attorney stating that the only record found indicates her case was closed in 2017. Her attorney expressed that her college dream has been shattered and that she is heartbroken. She had been looking forward to surprising her family and sharing her experiences from her first semester studying business. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not yet commented on the violation of the federal judge's emergency order. Lopez Belloza is currently staying with her grandparents in Honduras, feeling as though she is losing everything.
