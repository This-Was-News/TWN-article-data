## Article summary
Pope Leo's visit to Lebanon has sparked both hope and frustration, particularly in southern villages that have been heavily impacted by conflict and economic hardship. While the Pope's presence is seen as a potential source of strength and a reminder of the Church's presence, many feel overlooked. Father Fadi el-Mir, involved in organizing the papal visit, expressed a desire for the Church to be more responsive to the needs of the Lebanese people, especially in the face of increasing poverty and a difficult political situation. The country, which has a significant Christian minority, is grappling with the aftermath of a devastating port explosion, a financial collapse, and ongoing border tensions with Israel. Many Christians in southern Lebanon, whose villages have suffered damage from Israeli attacks, are disappointed that the Pope's itinerary does not include their region. They feel that the Church and the state have not provided sufficient support for rebuilding their homes and infrastructure. Despite these frustrations, there is a deep-seated desire among residents to remain in their ancestral lands, symbolized by their efforts to replant pine trees in areas damaged by conflict. The visit highlights the complex challenges Lebanon faces, balancing religious significance with urgent socio-economic and security concerns.
