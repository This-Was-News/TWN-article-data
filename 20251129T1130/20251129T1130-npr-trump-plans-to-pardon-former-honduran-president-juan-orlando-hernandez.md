## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced his intention to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted in 2024 of drug trafficking and weapons charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison. Trump stated on social media that Hernandez was "treated very harshly and unfairly" according to people he respects. Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court for conspiring to import cocaine and had served two terms as president. His lawyer expressed gratitude for Trump's action, calling it a "great injustice" being righted. Trump's announcement coincided with his endorsement of Nasry "Tito" Asfura for Honduras' presidency, warning of dire consequences if a "wrong Leader" is elected. Asfura, a conservative National Party candidate, faces competition from Rixi Moncada of the Libre party and Salvador Nasralla of the Liberal Party. Trump has framed the election as a test for democracy, suggesting a loss for Asfura could lead Honduras towards Venezuela's influence. Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has maintained a pragmatic relationship with the U.S. administration. Argentine President Javier Milei also voiced his support for Asfura, opposing what he termed "leftist tyrants" in Honduras.
