## Article summary
Airlines globally are working to fix a software glitch on the widely used A320 aircraft, which caused disruptions leading into a busy travel weekend. The issue, identified after a JetBlue plane experienced a sudden altitude drop, has been linked to intense solar radiation potentially corrupting flight control data. Both the FAA and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency have mandated a software update for affected aircraft, impacting over 500 U.S.-registered planes. In Japan, All Nippon Airways canceled 65 domestic flights due to the glitch. U.S. airlines like American, Air India, Delta, and United are implementing the fix, expecting minor delays but prioritizing safety over cancellations. European carriers, including British Airways, EasyJet, Lufthansa, and SAS, reported minimal impact or have already completed the updates, with flights largely returning to normal. The software fix is relatively quick, often manageable between flights or during overnight checks. The A320 family is a best-selling aircraft, and this widespread issue occurred during the peak Thanksgiving travel period in the United States. The incident follows a specific JetBlue flight diversion on October 30th, where passengers were injured.
