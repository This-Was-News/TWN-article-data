## Article summary
Peru's President José Jerí announced a state of emergency along the country's southern border, deploying additional armed forces to manage a surge of Venezuelan migrants leaving Chile. These migrants, originally seeking better lives in Chile, are now heading north due to rising anti-immigrant sentiment and hardening stances in Chile. This situation has been exacerbated by the presidential campaign of José Antonio Kast, who has centered his platform on fears of immigration and crime. Kast's rhetoric, including a video warning immigrants to leave Chile voluntarily or face expulsion, has fueled xenophobia and contributed to the outflow of people. Peruvian officials have noted the consequences of such rhetoric, emphasizing the need to prevent a humanitarian crisis. Images of migrant families moving north from Chile into Peru have been widely circulated, with many stranded in border towns due to Peru's own border controls. The Peruvian Foreign Minister dismissed Kast's comments, stating that a presidential candidate cannot speak for the Chilean government. The exact number of migrants leaving Chile remains unclear, but the situation highlights the complex challenges of migration in South America.
