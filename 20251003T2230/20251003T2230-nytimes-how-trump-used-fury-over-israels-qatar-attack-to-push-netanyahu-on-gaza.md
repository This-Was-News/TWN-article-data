## Article summary
Israeli jets launched a missile strike on a residential neighborhood in Doha, Qatar, targeting Hamas representatives discussing a potential cease-fire plan for Gaza. This aggressive act by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provoked strong reactions from officials in the Middle East and Washington, jeopardizing cease-fire prospects. Despite the initial backlash, Netanyahu and President Trump later announced support for a plan to end the nearly two-year-old war. Trump enthusiastically described the plan as a significant and beautiful day for civilization, while Netanyahu cautiously stated it achieves their war aims. The article is authored by Mark Mazzetti, Adam Rasgon, and Katie Rogers, who cover national security, Israeli-Palestinian affairs, and the White House respectively.
