## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has accused the Pentagon's independent watchdog of being weaponized and announced plans to overhaul the inspector general's office. The changes include ending anonymous complaints, dismissing non-credible complaints, and setting tighter timelines for investigations. Advocates and experts express concerns that these changes will undermine progress in protecting women and minorities from abuse and discourage legitimate complaints. Hegseth's directives are part of a broader Trump administration effort to reshape inspectors general across government agencies. The changes come as Hegseth himself is under investigation for sharing sensitive information on the Signal app. Critics argue that the changes lack evidence and will have a chilling effect on reporting sexual harassment, bullying, and racism. Recent cases, like the murder of Army Spc. Vanessa Guillen, highlight ongoing struggles with sexual assault and violence toward women in the military. Hegseth's memo also warns against false statements, which critics say will further discourage reporting. Both advocates and experts believe these changes will make it harder for service members to report issues and undermine confidence in the system.
