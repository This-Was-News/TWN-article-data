## Article summary
Sean Combs, a 55-year-old music mogul, was sentenced to 50 months in prison for two counts of transportation for prostitution. The trial, which lasted eight weeks, included emotionally charged testimony and celebrity appearances. Prosecutors accused Combs of operating a criminal organization that enabled sex crimes, while his defense team discredited the women's testimony. The jury acquitted Combs of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy but found him guilty of transporting two women across state lines for commercial sex. Key evidence included a 2016 surveillance video of Combs beating Cassie Ventura. Despite the acquittal on serious charges, Combs' violent behavior was cited as a reason for a longer sentence. The judge emphasized the need for accountability in cases of exploitation and violence against women.
