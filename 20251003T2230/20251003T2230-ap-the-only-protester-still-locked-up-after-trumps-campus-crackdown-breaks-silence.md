## Article summary
Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian living in New Jersey, was arrested during pro-Palestinian protests and has been detained since March. She grew up in the West Bank and has deep ties to Gaza, where many of her relatives have been killed in the ongoing war. Kordia was one of the first arrested in the Trump administration's crackdown on protesters, but unlike others, she remains in detention. She was not a student or part of a supportive group, making her case less visible. The government has targeted her, citing her money transfers to relatives as potential evidence of terrorist ties, despite a federal judge ruling that the administration unlawfully targeted protesters. Kordia's legal status is complex, as she overstayed her student visa, and her case is caught in a lengthy appeals process. She dreams of reuniting with her family and living peacefully in the U.S., but her detention has made her feel helpless and isolated.
