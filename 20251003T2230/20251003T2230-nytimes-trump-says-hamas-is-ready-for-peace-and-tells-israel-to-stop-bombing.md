## Article summary
President Trump announced that Hamas is ready for a lasting peace after the militant group agreed to release all Israeli hostages, but the offer's ambiguity leaves questions about its acceptance by Israel. Hamas's statement did not address key elements of Trump's peace plan, such as disarmament and amnesty for its members. The group wants to negotiate the plan's details and play a role in future Palestinian governance. The war in Gaza, which began on Oct. 7, 2023, has resulted in significant casualties and destruction. Some U.S. lawmakers welcomed Hamas's response, while others cautioned against viewing it as a breakthrough. International mediators, including Qatar and Egypt, are working to finalize the plan. The Israeli government has not yet officially commented on Hamas's statement. The peace deal's success hinges on whether Hamas's response satisfies Israel and the White House, with significant challenges remaining in its implementation.
