## Article summary
President Trump has urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the release of Israeli hostages by Hamas. Hamas agreed to release all Israeli hostages, both living and dead, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, as outlined in Trump's 20-point peace plan. Trump emphasized the importance of stopping the bombing to ensure the safe and swift release of the hostages, stating that the situation is currently too dangerous. The plan, unveiled earlier this week, calls for a ceasefire if Hamas releases all 48 remaining hostages within 72 hours. Trump had given Hamas a 'last chance' to accept the plan, warning of severe consequences if they did not comply. The White House plan aims to end the war in Gaza, provide more aid, and secure the release of hostages. Meanwhile, Israel has ordered Palestinians in Gaza City to move south, with those who stay being considered militants. The UN has reported intense strikes in areas where people have been told to relocate, including Deir al Balah, which is hosting over half a million displaced people. The UN sees the peace plan as a 'window of opportunity' for aid to resume and hostages to be released.
