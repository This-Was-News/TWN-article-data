## Article summary
Sean Combs, a once-prominent hip-hop mogul, was sentenced to over four years in prison for prostitution-related offenses, with the judge emphasizing the need for accountability in cases of exploitation and violence against women. The sentence, totaling 50 months, was seen as a message to both abusers and victims. Combs' lawyers argued he was merely a client, but the judge rejected this, stating that his actions involved coercion and were more severe. The case involved lurid accounts of violence and fetishistic sex marathons, with two former girlfriends, including singer Cassie, testifying about feeling violated. Combs apologized in court, calling his conduct 'disgusting, shameful, and sick,' and expressed remorse to his ex-girlfriends, family, and the community. The judge also imposed a $500,000 fine, the maximum possible. Despite his fall from grace, Combs' family and lawyers portrayed him as a changed man who had used his detention to help others. The prosecution depicted him as a longtime abuser. The sentence was met with mixed reactions, with some praising the judge's decision and others expressing sympathy for Combs' family. The judge encouraged Combs to use his time in prison to demonstrate real accountability and change.
