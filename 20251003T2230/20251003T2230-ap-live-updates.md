## Article summary
Sean 'Diddy' Combs was sentenced to 4 years and 2 months in prison for crimes involving sex workers, violence, and drug-fueled encounters. The judge emphasized the need for deterrence and expressed doubts about Combs' rehabilitation. Combs was convicted of flying people across state lines for sexual encounters but acquitted of more serious charges like sex trafficking. The judge imposed a $500,000 fine and ordered five years of supervised release. Combs' defense team argued for a shorter sentence, citing his philanthropy and personal growth, but the judge was unconvinced. Combs apologized to his family and victims, acknowledging his actions and expressing remorse. The judge noted Combs' history of abuse and violence, including a recent assault on his former girlfriend. Despite his contributions to the Black community, the judge emphasized that his good deeds could not overshadow his crimes. Combs' children and supporters pleaded for leniency, highlighting his positive impact on their lives and his potential for change. The judge ultimately sentenced Combs to prison, rejecting the defense's arguments for probation or immediate release.
