## Article summary
OpenAI's new Sora app generates AI-driven short-form videos, allowing users to create content with simple text prompts. The app, similar to TikTok, enables realistic video creation, including depictions of real individuals with their permission. While Sora includes features to identify AI-generated content and has guardrails to prevent misuse, NPR found loopholes allowing the creation of videos supporting conspiracy theories and depicting violence. The app also permits the use of copyrighted material, which OpenAI defends as a way to foster creativity. Despite concerns about deepfakes and the erosion of trust in online content, researchers note that society has largely adapted to AI-generated media. However, the rapid advancement of AI tools like Sora raises questions about the future of reality and trust in digital media.
