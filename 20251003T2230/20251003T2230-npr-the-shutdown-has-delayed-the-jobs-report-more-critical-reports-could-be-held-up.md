## Article summary
The government shutdown has delayed the Labor Department's monthly jobs report, leaving businesses and policymakers uncertain about the labor market's strength. Economists rely on this report, usually released on the first Friday of the month, to gauge economic health and guide decisions. The shutdown has furloughed the staff responsible for compiling the report, pushing back its release until the government reopens. The report was expected to show a slowdown in job growth, partly due to the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Health care has been a bright spot in an otherwise sluggish job market. The shutdown also threatens to delay other critical economic reports, such as the September inflation report. Without this data, making informed economic decisions is challenging, especially during a period of economic transition. While alternative data sources exist, they cannot match the comprehensive scope of the government's labor market surveys. The shutdown's duration will determine the extent of the data collection disruption. Economists are hopeful for a swift resolution to the shutdown to resume regular economic reporting.
