## Article summary
Federal officials have approved a $608 million reimbursement for Florida's immigration detention center in the Everglades, nicknamed 'Alligator Alcatraz.' The funds, awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, have not yet been released pending review by FEMA. The reimbursement process could lead to the facility being ordered to close again due to a federal judge's injunction, which cited insufficient environmental review. The injunction was temporarily halted by an appellate court, allowing the facility to remain open. President Trump visited the facility in July and suggested it could serve as a model for future detention centers. Environmental groups argue that the facility is a federal project and should have undergone a complete environmental review. They plan to continue their legal efforts to stop the project.
