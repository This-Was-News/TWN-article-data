## Article summary
Hopes for a quick end to the government shutdown faded as Democrats refused to budge in a Senate vote, and President Donald Trump prepared to implement layoffs and cuts. The Senate vote to advance a Republican bill failed, with Democrats demanding healthcare benefits extension and Republicans refusing to commit until the government reopens. The shutdown threatens federal workers, the broader economy, and gives the Trump administration a chance to reshape federal agencies. Democrats are using their Senate seats to hold out for policy concessions, focusing on healthcare. Trump aims to make the shutdown as painful as possible, with plans to cut federal agencies and withhold infrastructure funds. Democratic leaders remain firm, despite threats. The shutdown could furlough 750,000 federal employees, losing $400 million in daily wages. Bipartisan senators are discussing health care compromises, but no resolution is in sight. Both sides are entrenched, with Republicans wanting cuts to healthcare subsidies and Democrats insisting on extensions. The shutdown's economic impact and political standoff continue to escalate.
