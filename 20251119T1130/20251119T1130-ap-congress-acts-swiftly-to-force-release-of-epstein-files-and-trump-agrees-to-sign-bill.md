## Article summary
Both the House and Senate have swiftly passed legislation compelling the Justice Department to publicly release its files concerning convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This bipartisan effort overcame months of opposition, including initial resistance from President Donald Trump and House Republican leadership. Despite Trump's earlier attempts to downplay the issue, he ultimately agreed to sign the bill, acknowledging the political reality. Speaker Mike Johnson also faced pressure and ultimately voted for the bill, despite expressing concerns about potential unintended consequences regarding the disclosure of information on victims and ongoing investigations. The passage of the bill is seen as a significant victory for Epstein's abuse survivors, who have long advocated for accountability. Only one lawmaker, Rep. Clay Higgins, voted against the bill, citing worries about revealing information on innocent individuals. The legislation mandates the release of all files and communications related to Epstein and the investigation into his death within 30 days, with provisions for redacting sensitive victim or ongoing investigation details. The bill's swift approval in the Senate, with unanimous consent, followed the House's overwhelming vote. This action underscores the growing public demand for transparency surrounding Epstein's connections to powerful figures and his alleged criminal activities.
