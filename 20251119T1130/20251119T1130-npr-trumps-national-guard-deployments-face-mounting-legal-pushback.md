## Article summary
President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to U.S. cities are facing increasing resistance in the courts. Most recently, a Tennessee judge temporarily blocked the state's use of the Guard in Memphis, ruling that the governor's deployment order exceeded his authority. This follows similar legal challenges in other cities where judges have deemed military involvement in domestic matters unnecessary or unlawful. Some legal and military experts view these court decisions as a sign that the system of checks and balances is functioning. In Tennessee, a lawsuit filed by Democratic officials argued that the state's constitution did not meet the criteria for deploying the Guard, as there was no "rebellion or invasion." The judge agreed, stating the governor's power is not unfettered. The White House, however, criticized the ruling, with a spokesperson claiming the judge misunderstood the law. While the pause on the Memphis deployment is not yet in effect pending a potential appeal, legal experts note that allowing troops to remain on the streets during an appeal process seems counterintuitive if the deployment is presumptively illegal. The Defense Department has ordered some troops to return to their home states, partly due to federal court injunctions. The Trump administration is challenging these rulings, and has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the Chicago deployment case. Legal experts suggest the Supreme Court's decision could have a significant ripple effect depending on its scope. Despite these legal battles, Trump has indicated plans for further deployments and has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act. Ultimately, while courts can restrict presidential military actions, public sentiment is seen as a more powerful check on executive power.
