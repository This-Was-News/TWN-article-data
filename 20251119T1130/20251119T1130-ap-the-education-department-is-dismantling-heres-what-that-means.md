## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Education is undergoing a significant restructuring, with several of its core functions being transferred to other federal agencies, signaling a move towards fulfilling President Trump's campaign promise to abolish the department. Offices responsible for supporting schools and colleges are being reassigned to departments such as Labor, Interior, and Health and Human Services. While Education Secretary Linda McMahon has publicly advocated for this dissolution, citing potential efficiencies, questions remain about the preparedness of these other agencies to absorb these responsibilities. The department's role in managing the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio, disbursing Pell Grants, and overseeing accreditation will continue for now. However, the management of student loans and grant programs could also be shifted to different departments. The crucial function of providing educational support for students with disabilities is slated for a potential move to Health and Human Services. Similarly, the department's civil rights enforcement, which has already seen staff reductions, may be transferred to the Department of Justice. The ultimate impact of these changes on students, particularly those from rural or low-income backgrounds and students with disabilities, remains uncertain as the department's operations are parceled out.
