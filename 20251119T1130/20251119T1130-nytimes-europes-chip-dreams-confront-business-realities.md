## Article summary
Europe is investing billions to bolster its semiconductor supply chain, aiming to produce a larger share of the world's advanced chips by the end of the decade. A key part of this strategy involves a joint venture with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to build a factory in Dresden, Germany, with production slated to begin in 2027. This initiative seeks to reduce reliance on Taiwan, which currently dominates global chip production, a vulnerability exposed by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. However, TSMC's Taiwanese suppliers are encountering significant challenges in Europe, including complex permitting processes, stringent labor laws, and demanding environmental regulations. These hurdles complicate the timely establishment of the Dresden plant, which relies on these specialized suppliers. The urgency for Europe to increase its chip manufacturing capacity was highlighted by a recent dispute involving a Chinese-owned chipmaker in the Netherlands that affected the supply of automotive chips. European officials aspire to double their current output of advanced chips, which is less than 10 percent of the global total, by 2030. The Dresden project is envisioned to transform the region into a significant semiconductor hub, building upon existing chipmaking infrastructure. The success of Europe's "chip dreams" hinges on overcoming these business realities and facilitating the integration of its key Taiwanese partners.
