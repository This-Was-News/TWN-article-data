## Article summary
President Trump has developed a close relationship with Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, a company whose advanced chips have become a significant tool in international trade and peace negotiations. Nvidia's chips are crucial for artificial intelligence projects, and the company has committed to increasing its manufacturing in the United States, aligning with Trump's economic agenda. The administration has leveraged Nvidia's technology as a bargaining chip with countries like Saudi Arabia, Britain, and China, and has even discussed using AI technology sales to encourage peaceful resolutions between nations such as Armenia and Azerbaijan. This partnership has seen Nvidia make substantial investments in U.S. manufacturing, totaling $500 billion, which has been viewed as a foreign policy success by the Trump administration. Huang's willingness to align with Trump's interventionist approach, including discussions about government cuts from chip sales to China, has further cemented their relationship. Despite initial challenges in their personal rapport, the strategic importance of Nvidia's technology and its market value has fostered a strong bond. However, Huang's lobbying efforts to sell advanced chips to China have faced significant pushback from national security officials, highlighting the complex balance between economic interests and security concerns in the AI race.
