## Article summary
New York City's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, has become a prominent target for conservative media figures even before taking office. He has been labeled with terms such as "commie," "Marxist," and "jihadist sympathizer," with some outlets portraying him as a sinister figure incompatible with American values. Fox News host Laura Ingraham warned viewers about "smiling socialists who rule like Soviet tyrants," and the New York Post featured a cover depicting Mamdani with the Soviet hammer and sickle. Conservative media see Mamdani as a potential bogeyman, similar to past figures like Nancy Pelosi, who can energize their audiences and aid Republican political efforts. His socialist affiliation and Muslim background are frequently cited in these attacks, with critics often conflating socialism with communism. Some Jewish groups have expressed concerns due to his support for Palestinian rights, though Mamdani has denounced Hamas and pledged to combat antisemitism. Despite his efforts to focus on his message, Mamdani has stated that racist and baseless attacks have not been mitigated by his attempts to behave well. Some conservative outlets are attempting to frame him as the de facto leader of the Democratic party, aiming to define him for consumers and associate all Democrats with his perceived fringe beliefs. Media analysts suggest Mamdani could become a significant figure for conservative media to rally against, potentially comparable to past prominent political figures.
