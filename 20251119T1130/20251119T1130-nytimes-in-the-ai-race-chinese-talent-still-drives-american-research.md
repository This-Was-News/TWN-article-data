## Article summary
Despite the prevailing narrative of China as an adversary in the artificial intelligence race, Chinese talent remains a critical driving force behind American AI research. Many leading AI researchers joining ambitious projects in the U.S., such as Meta's Superintelligence Lab, are immigrants, with a significant portion born in China. Two recent studies highlight the substantial contributions of researchers educated in China to major U.S. AI labs, both in industry and academia. These findings emerge amidst a backdrop of tightened immigration policies and anti-China sentiment in Silicon Valley. A 2020 study by the Paulson Institute indicated that Chinese AI researchers constituted nearly a third of the world's top talent, with most employed by American firms and institutions. The research offers a more complex view of U.S. reliance on Chinese engineers and the ongoing, albeit often understated, collaboration between researchers in both nations, despite escalating rhetoric from Washington and Beijing.
