## Article summary
Former FBI Director James Comey's legal team is arguing for the dismissal of his criminal case, asserting that the prosecution is vindictive and fueled by President Donald Trump's personal animosity. Their argument centers on the claim that Trump, harboring a deep-seated hatred for Comey after firing him, orchestrated the prosecution. This motion comes in the wake of a judge's strong criticism of the Justice Department's handling of the case, highlighting significant investigative missteps. Comey faces charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, though he has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing. His lawyers contend that the prosecutor appointed to the case, Lindsey Halligan, lacked prior experience and was hastily appointed to pursue charges against Comey and other Trump adversaries. They presented evidence, including public statements from government officials, to support their claim of animus leading to a selective prosecution. The Justice Department, however, denies these allegations, maintaining that the indictment is supported by the evidence. The arguments are being presented to U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, following a magistrate judge's scathing review of the prosecution's conduct.
