## Article summary
President Donald Trump hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House for a warm meeting, designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally and announcing significant new Saudi investments in the U.S. The visit included military cooperation discussions, with Trump formalizing the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, while acknowledging Israel's concerns and the Abraham Accords framework. The crown prince reiterated Saudi Arabia's desire to join the Accords but stressed the need for a clear path to Palestinian statehood. The meeting also addressed a potential civilian nuclear agreement, with Israel having raised concerns about this as well. The crown prince pledged to increase Saudi financial commitments to the U.S. from $600 billion to $1 trillion, with details expected to cover investments in AI and the purchase of American equipment. Questions regarding journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing were largely set aside, with Trump defending the crown prince and dismissing the reporter's line of questioning. The event was marked by considerable ceremony, including a military flyover and a lavish dinner attended by tech leaders and celebrities. Trump contrasted his firm handshake with Prince Mohammed to a "fist bump" he criticized his predecessor for. The crown prince denied direct involvement in Khashoggi's death, stating that Saudi Arabia had conducted investigations and improved its system to prevent future incidents.
