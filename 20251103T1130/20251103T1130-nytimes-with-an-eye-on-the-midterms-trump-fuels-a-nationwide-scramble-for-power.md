## Article summary
President Trump is actively involved in a nationwide redistricting effort to redraw congressional maps and secure more Republican seats before the 2026 midterms, aiming to prevent Democratic control of the House of Representatives. This strategy involves pressuring lawmakers in numerous states, including Indiana, to alter district boundaries. In response, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is also advocating for similar redistricting measures in states like Illinois to counter the Republican advantage. This midcycle redistricting push represents a significant departure from historical norms and has escalated into a partisan battleground across nearly 20 states. The intense redistricting activities reveal internal divisions within both parties, with some Republicans defying Trump and Democrats publicly disagreeing on strategies. Critics warn that this practice could undermine democratic principles by allowing parties to manipulate electoral maps at will. The outcome of these redistricting battles could significantly impact which party controls Congress.
