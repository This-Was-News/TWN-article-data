## Article summary
The Supreme Court is set to hear a significant case challenging President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose broad tariffs on international trade partners. This case presents a unique legal and political challenge for the court's conservative majority, which has generally supported the president's policies. The outcome could have major repercussions for the global economy, American businesses, and consumers. President Trump has personally emphasized the importance of the case, viewing a defeat as a personal affront and arguing that the power to impose tariffs is crucial for national defense. Legal experts suggest the case is a toss-up, with justices potentially considering the broader implications for presidential power across several upcoming cases. The court has expedited the schedule for this case, indicating its significance. The legality of the tariffs hinges on the interpretation of a 1977 law, with opponents arguing that the president overstepped his authority by using it to impose taxes, while the administration contends it grants broad emergency powers. The case also brings into play doctrines like the major questions doctrine and the nondelegation doctrine, which could limit presidential authority. Lower courts have largely ruled against the administration, though the tariffs have remained in effect during litigation. The Supreme Court faces a "legitimacy dilemma," needing to balance legal principles with public perception and the president's personal involvement.
