## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown is nearing its longest duration ever as President Trump and Democrats remain at an impasse, with no significant talks to end the stalemate. Trump has stated he "won't be extorted" by Democrats and will only negotiate to reopen the government after their demands regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies are met. Millions of Americans face potential loss of food aid and expiring health care subsidies, while federal workers are missing paychecks. Trump also urged Senate Republicans to eliminate the filibuster to advance his agenda. Democrats insist on negotiating ACA subsidies and other issues before reopening the government, while Republicans hope moderate Democrats will provide the necessary votes. Flight delays are increasing due to staffing shortages at airports, and there's concern over the distribution of SNAP benefits. The shutdown, now in its 33rd day, is approaching the record set in 2019. Democrats accuse Republicans of attempting to "weaponize hunger" by delaying SNAP payments, while the administration points to the need for Democrats to reopen the government. The lack of a clear resolution suggests the shutdown could continue indefinitely, impacting various sectors and millions of citizens.
