## Article summary
The Trump administration faces a Monday deadline to inform federal judges whether it will continue funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the government shutdown. The U.S. Department of Agriculture had planned to halt payments to SNAP, a program serving approximately one in eight Americans and costing around $8 billion monthly, starting November 1st. This decision has created uncertainty for millions regarding their food security, with benefits likely to be delayed in November regardless of court outcomes due to processing times. Twenty-five states, the District of Columbia, cities, and nonprofits have challenged the administration's plan, arguing for a legal obligation to maintain the program. Judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts have already ruled that the administration must continue funding SNAP, granting leeway on the extent of funding for November. The USDA possesses a $5 billion contingency fund, which the administration reversed an earlier plan to utilize. Democratic officials suggest the administration could also access a separate $23 billion fund. U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island mandated that SNAP must be funded using at least contingency funds and ordered the continuation of all previous work requirement waivers. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani declared the suspension unlawful and ordered the federal government to provide an update by Monday on whether it will use reserve funds for reduced benefits or fully fund the program. Advocates warn that halting food aid would force difficult choices for beneficiaries, while many states are expediting funding for food banks or finding ways to load benefits onto SNAP cards.
