## Article summary
Thousands of Sudanese are trapped in el-Fasher with few reaching safety after paramilitary forces seized the city. Survivors report killings, beatings, and sexual assaults, with the World Health Organization confirming at least 460 deaths in the hospital. The UN migration agency estimates over 8,000 people displaced since the takeover, but less than 6,000 have reached the nearest camp in Tawila. Aid workers express concern for those still in el-Fasher, fearing for their survival due to the difficulty and cost of movement. The fall of el-Fasher marks a critical point in the ongoing war, which has already killed tens of thousands and displaced millions. Many fleeing survivors are disoriented and dehydrated, some arriving with no memory of their names. The Sudanese government accuses the RSF of war crimes and urges the international community to designate them as a terrorist organization, while also accusing the UAE of arming the RSF. The UAE diplomat acknowledged a past mistake in supporting both warring generals and supports a humanitarian ceasefire and transitional government. Fears are growing that the RSF may expand its campaign, with recent attacks on displaced camps in Kordofan resulting in multiple deaths, including children.
