## Article summary
Health officials in Gaza reported that Israel handed over the bodies of 45 Palestinians on Monday, a day after Palestinian militants returned the remains of three Israeli soldiers killed in the October 7th attack. The identified soldiers are Capt. Omer Neutra, Staff Sgt. Oz Daniel, and Col. Assaf Hamami. This exchange is a key part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, which has seen Palestinian militants release 20 hostages so far, with eight remaining in Gaza. Since the ceasefire began, Israel has been returning 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli hostage. Gaza's Health Ministry has struggled to identify Palestinian bodies due to a lack of DNA kits, posting images online in an effort to aid identification. Meanwhile, Israel is dealing with a political scandal involving the former legal chief for its military, who was arrested after admitting to leaking a video of soldiers assaulting a detainee. The U.K. is also increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza, with Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper visiting Jordan to advocate for more aid and fewer restrictions. The ongoing conflict, which began with the October 7th attack, has resulted in a significant number of Palestinian casualties, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.
