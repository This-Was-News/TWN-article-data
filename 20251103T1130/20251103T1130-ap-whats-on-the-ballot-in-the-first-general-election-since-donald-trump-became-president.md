## Article summary
The first general election since Donald Trump's presidency features his influence prominently in state and local races across the U.S. Key contests include gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York City mayoral race, and a California proposition to redraw congressional districts. These elections are seen as an early test of voter sentiment towards the party in power. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill faces Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Trump. Virginia's gubernatorial race pits Democrat Abigail Spanberger against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, with Trump remaining a significant topic. The New York City mayoral election includes Democratic state legislator Zohran Mamdani and independent Andrew Cuomo. California voters will decide on a ballot measure to create a new congressional map, potentially shifting several House seats. Control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is also at stake, with implications for future election disputes. Special elections for a vacant congressional seat in Texas and state legislative races in Minnesota, Virginia, and New Jersey are also on the ballot. Several states, including Maine, Texas, Colorado, and Washington, will vote on various ballot measures concerning voting rights, gun violence, parental rights, and citizenship requirements. Mayoral races in major cities like Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Atlanta are also being decided.
