## Article summary
British Transport Police have charged 32-year-old Anthony Williams with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm, and one count of possession of a bladed article following a mass stabbing attack on a train. Williams is also charged with attempted murder for an earlier knife attack at Pontoon Dock light rail station. The train stabbings, which wounded 11 people, are not being treated as an act of terror, and authorities are not seeking other suspects. A second man initially arrested was released without charge. Williams, from Peterborough, is due to appear in court. The attack occurred on a train traveling from Doncaster to London, spreading panic among passengers. The most seriously injured victim is a member of railway staff who intervened and is in critical but stable condition. Williams was arrested on the train in Huntingdon within eight minutes of the first emergency calls. While deemed an isolated incident, security has been increased on railways with armed police patrols.
