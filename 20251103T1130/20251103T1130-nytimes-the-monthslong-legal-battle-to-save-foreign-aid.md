## Article summary
A lengthy legal battle has ensued over President Trump's attempt to slash foreign aid funding, a policy that has faced numerous challenges in the federal judiciary since February. This lawsuit, one of many against the Trump agenda, highlights the judicial system's struggle to keep pace with the president's actions. Despite initial rulings in favor of aid organizations, the Supreme Court has allowed the administration to withhold billions in foreign aid. The administration argues that foreign aid is an extension of foreign policy, which is the president's prerogative. A federal judge initially found the blanket suspension of foreign aid grants unlawful, ordering the government to resume payments. However, the Trump administration appealed, leading to a complex series of rulings and counter-rulings. The administration's use of tactics like pocket rescission and appeals to the Supreme Court has repeatedly stalled or overturned lower court decisions. While the legal dispute continues, advocates argue that significant damage has already been done to humanitarian missions and communities abroad that rely on this aid. The case underscores a broader trend of the executive branch expanding its power, with Congress offering little resistance.
