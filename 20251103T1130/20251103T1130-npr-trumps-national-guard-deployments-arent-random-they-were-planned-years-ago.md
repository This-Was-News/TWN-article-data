## Article summary
President Trump's deployments of National Guard troops to U.S. cities, which have drawn criticism and legal challenges, appear to be part of a long-standing administration goal to use the military for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. This strategy deviates significantly from historical federal use of the Guard and raises concerns about potential voter suppression during the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Trump and senior aide Stephen Miller have repeatedly discussed employing the National Guard for immigration raids, despite laws prohibiting domestic policing by the military. To circumvent these laws, they have considered invoking the Insurrection Act. This plan is also reflected in "Project 2025," a conservative action plan that advocates for using executive power to address illegal immigration. Legal experts and activists worry that such actions could fundamentally alter the military's role on U.S. soil and potentially lead to authoritarianism, starting with immigrants but not ending there. Former DHS chief of staff Miles Taylor confirms that these ideas were discussed internally during Trump's first term. The administration's justification for current deployments, such as protecting federal immigration facilities, is facing legal scrutiny. The potential use of the Insurrection Act to enable military involvement in domestic law enforcement, particularly immigration enforcement, is a key concern for civil liberties advocates.
