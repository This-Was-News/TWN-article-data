## Article summary
President Donald Trump demanded that Republican leaders scrap the Senate filibuster to end the ongoing government shutdown, a proposal swiftly rejected by GOP leaders who have historically defended the rule. Trump argued the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome objections, allows Democrats to block Republican initiatives and keep the government closed while they push for an extension of health care subsidies. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republican leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, reiterated their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, emphasizing its importance for the Senate's function. Despite Trump's strong stance, changing the filibuster would require more votes than currently exist in the divided Senate. The shutdown, now in its 31st day, is causing significant disruptions, including potential halts to SNAP food aid and flight delays. While quiet bipartisan talks are occurring among senators, Trump has not been actively involved in negotiations. Democratic leaders are urging Trump to engage in direct talks to resolve the stalemate, highlighting that the core issue revolves around health care insurance costs. The situation is escalating as courts are being asked to clarify how SNAP can be legally funded, with administration lawyers seeking guidance. The shutdown's impact is being felt across the nation, causing stress for citizens and highlighting the dysfunction in Washington. Many anticipate that a resolution may emerge after upcoming off-year elections, as both parties assess their political standing with voters. If the shutdown persists, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse from 2019.
