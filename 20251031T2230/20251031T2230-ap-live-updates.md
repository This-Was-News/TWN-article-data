## Article summary
Two federal judges have ruled that the Trump administration must continue funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the government shutdown, using contingency funds. This decision came just before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments, which would have significantly impacted millions of Americans, particularly households of color. The rulings, made nearly simultaneously, aim to prevent a lapse in benefits that could have lasting negative effects on low-income families. The process of reloading SNAP debit cards could still take one to two weeks.
