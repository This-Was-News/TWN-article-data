## Article summary
Top Republican and Democratic senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee have publicly stated that the Pentagon has not provided Congress with the legal justification for U.S. boat strikes against alleged drug trafficking vessels. Senators Roger Wicker and Jack Reed have sent multiple letters requesting this information and the president's execute orders, which they claim the administration has missed legal deadlines to provide. This lack of transparency has caused bipartisan alarm on Capitol Hill regarding President Trump's expanding military campaign. House Democrats have also sent similar requests for information without receiving a response. The administration's justification for these strikes, which have reportedly killed at least 61 people, is based on designating certain cartels as terrorist organizations. A recent classified briefing on the strikes excluded Senate Democrats, drawing criticism from both parties. Lawmakers are concerned about the lack of understanding regarding the use of lethal force and the importance of congressional oversight. While U.S. officials have identified potential targets in Venezuela, President Trump has stated he is not currently considering an escalation to land-based attacks. The U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier has been ordered to the region, suggesting a potential pause in escalation until its arrival.
