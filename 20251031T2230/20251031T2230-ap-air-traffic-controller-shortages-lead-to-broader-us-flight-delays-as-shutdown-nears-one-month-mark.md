## Article summary
The United States is experiencing widespread flight delays due to ongoing shortages of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by a government shutdown that has entered its fourth week. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned travelers to expect increased disruptions as controllers continue to work without pay. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported significant delays at numerous airports, with some experiencing delays of two hours or more. These staffing issues, which predate the shutdown, are now compounded by controllers working mandatory overtime without compensation, making it difficult to cover basic expenses like gas. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has stated that missing a full month's pay is unsustainable for these essential workers. A temporary ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport last weekend highlighted the severity of the situation. Some airports have begun offering support to federal aviation employees working without pay. The FAA was already facing a deficit of approximately 3,000 air traffic controllers before the shutdown began.
