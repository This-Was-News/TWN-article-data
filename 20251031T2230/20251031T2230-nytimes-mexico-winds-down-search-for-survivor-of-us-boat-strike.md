## Article summary
Mexican officials are concluding their search for a survivor of a U.S. military strike on a boat in the Pacific, having found no one after days of searching. The Pentagon had stated that one person survived the attack, which killed at least 14 others, and alerted a nearby Mexican military boat to assist in the rescue. The Mexican Navy initiated a search-and-rescue operation but is set to stop actively searching on Saturday morning, adhering to a 96-hour search protocol. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed receiving word from the Mexican Navy that no survivors were found. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had announced the strikes, involving three deadly attacks on four boats in international waters, and noted that Mexican search-and-rescue authorities had assumed responsibility for the rescue. The U.S. military acted in accordance with international protocols by relaying the survivor's location to a Mexican aircraft. This incident occurs amidst a broader U.S. military deployment to the Caribbean for counterterrorism and counternarcotics missions. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has criticized the U.S. attacks, suggesting they violate international treaties, and has expressed unease about the U.S. military's willingness to use force against drug cartels. Meanwhile, bipartisan frustration is mounting in Congress over the administration's lack of detailed information and legal rationale for these operations, with senators requesting specific military orders and legal opinions.
