## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa has devastated the historic seaport of Black River, Jamaica, leaving up to 90% of structures without roofs and causing widespread destruction. The storm, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall, has been blamed for at least 19 deaths in Jamaica and 31 in Haiti. Residents are scrambling for relief amidst widespread power and water outages, with many communities isolated and in desperate need of aid. Helicopters are dropping food supplies as crews work to reopen roads choked with debris from shredded bamboo and toppled structures. The storm surge left a muddy, slimy mix of seawater and debris covering streets and mangled vehicles. Many residents, like Michelle Barnes and Sadique Blair, have lost everything, including their homes and businesses. Black River, once a bustling seaport and the first town in Jamaica to have electricity, now faces the daunting task of rebuilding. This disaster follows closely on the heels of Hurricane Beryl, which also battered Jamaica's southern coast in July 2024, leaving many communities still recovering. In Cuba, while no deaths were reported, the storm caused significant damage to infrastructure and agricultural crops, with many areas still without essential services.
