## Article summary
Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to a ceasefire following intense cross-border fighting in early October that resulted in dozens of casualties. This agreement was reached after talks mediated by Turkey and Qatar, with the next round scheduled for November 6th. The core issue fueling the conflict is the rising militancy of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Pakistan's border regions, with Pakistan accusing Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of providing sanctuary and failing to curb TTP attacks. Afghanistan's Taliban denies these accusations. The recent hostilities escalated after a TTP ambush killed Pakistani soldiers, leading to retaliatory strikes and subsequent cross-border gunfire. Analysts suggest Pakistan's military actions signal a tougher stance towards the Afghan Taliban if they continue to support the TTP. Despite diplomatic efforts, including past trilateral talks with China, tensions persist, exacerbated by Afghanistan's strengthening ties with India, Pakistan's rival. The TTP, which has deep ideological ties with the Afghan Taliban, has seen a resurgence in attacks against Pakistani security forces and civilians. Experts warn that the underlying issues remain unresolved, and the border tensions could escalate further, potentially leading to renewed intense fighting.
