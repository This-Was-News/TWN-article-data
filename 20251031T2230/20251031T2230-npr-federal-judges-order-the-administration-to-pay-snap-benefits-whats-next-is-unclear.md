## Article summary
Two federal judges have ordered the Trump administration to provide SNAP benefits to the 42 million Americans who rely on the program. However, it remains unclear how much assistance will be provided or when it will arrive. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston has given the administration until Monday to decide on paying at least partial SNAP benefits, declining to issue an immediate restraining order. In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order, stating that ending SNAP payments would harm individuals and local economies, and ordered the administration to distribute aid from emergency reserves as soon as possible. The administration had previously claimed it lacked sufficient funds and legal authority to pay November benefits due to the government shutdown. Judge Talwani acknowledged her order would leave millions without assistance starting Saturday, but stated that the U.S. Department of Agriculture must use emergency funds to continue SNAP. Judge McConnell's decision came from a lawsuit filed by cities and business groups, while Judge Talwani's was in response to a suit by Democratic-led states. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps one in eight U.S. residents, provides an average of $186 per month to recipients. The conflicting rulings and lack of clarity leave the future of these crucial benefits uncertain.
