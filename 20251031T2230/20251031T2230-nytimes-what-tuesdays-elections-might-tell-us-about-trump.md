## Article summary
Tuesday's elections are unlikely to be a primary focus for President Trump, who has been engaged in international diplomacy in Asia and plans to visit Florida. He has not actively campaigned in key states like New Jersey or California, offering only a late and lukewarm endorsement for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia. Despite Trump's apparent detachment, Democrats are leveraging his name in their campaigns, particularly in California where they aim to pass a ballot measure that could secure five additional House seats. The article highlights the ongoing political maneuvering and the strategic use of Trump's image by various political factions, even as he appears preoccupied with other matters.
