## Article summary
Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, is an ultraconservative politician with a long career in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). She was elected prime minister after forming an alliance with a right-wing populist party, shifting the LDP further to the right. Takaichi is known for her tough stance on immigration, hawkish policies on China, and traditional views on gender roles. Despite her conservative leanings, she has a personal interest in heavy metal music and motorcycles. Born in Nara, Takaichi worked her way up from modest beginnings, studying hard and eventually becoming a TV presenter before entering politics. She served in various key government positions under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whom she admires and sees as her ideological mentor. Takaichi's views on Japan's WWII history and her disdain for immigrants have courted controversy. As prime minister, she has appointed only two women to her cabinet, despite promising to increase their representation. Takaichi is expected to maintain a friendly relationship with former U.S. President Trump, following the diplomatic playbook of her predecessors.
