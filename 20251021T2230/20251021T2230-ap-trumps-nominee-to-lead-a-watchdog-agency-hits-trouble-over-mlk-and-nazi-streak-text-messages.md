## Article summary
Paul Ingrassia, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, faced significant opposition due to controversial text messages. Ingrassia's texts, reported by Politico, included derogatory comments about Martin Luther King Jr. and a self-description of having a 'Nazi streak.' Senate Majority Leader John Thune and several Republican senators, including Rick Scott and Ron Johnson, expressed their lack of support for Ingrassia's nomination. The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing the Hatch Act. Ingrassia's nomination appeared to be in jeopardy, with calls for its withdrawal. Ingrassia previously served in the White House and promoted false claims about the 2020 election. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs was scheduled to hear from Ingrassia, but the outcome remained uncertain. The Office of Special Counsel is currently led by acting Director Jamieson Greer and is investigating allegations related to political activity.
