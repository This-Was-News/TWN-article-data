## Article summary
A man pardoned by President Trump for his role in the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Christopher Moynihan, 34, was taken into custody after sending threatening texts about Jeffries, including plans to kill him. Moynihan was arraigned in New York and faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat. Jeffries, who is the top Democrat in the House, released a statement criticizing the pardons given to individuals involved in the Capitol riot, noting that many have since committed additional crimes. Moynihan was originally sentenced to 21 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release for his involvement in the riot. His arrest highlights the ongoing issue of threats to lawmakers, with the Capitol Police reporting a significant increase in threat assessment cases. Moynihan's arrest comes after he was heard on video inside the Senate chamber during the riot, expressing hostility towards lawmakers. The incident underscores the broader concern about the impact of pardons on public safety and the increased threats faced by political figures.
