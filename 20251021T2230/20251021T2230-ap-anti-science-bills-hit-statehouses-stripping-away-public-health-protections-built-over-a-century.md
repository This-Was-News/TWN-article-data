## Article summary
Over 420 anti-science bills targeting public health protections like vaccines, milk safety, and fluoride have been introduced in U.S. statehouses this year. These bills are part of a politically savvy campaign led by individuals with ties to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aiming to enshrine conspiracy theory-driven agendas into law. The effort seeks to strip away century-old protections integral to American society, with around 30 bills already enacted or adopted in 12 states. The campaign normalizes anti-vaccine ideas and has contributed to falling vaccination rates, leading to resurgences of diseases like measles and whooping cough. Experts warn that this movement poses significant public health risks, as seen in the tragic case of Liam Dahlberg, who died from a vaccine-preventable disease. The Dahlbergs and others are fighting against this anti-science movement, which disputes proven health measures and spreads false conspiracy theories. Despite the successes of global vaccine efforts, fluoride in water, and milk pasteurization, activists continue to push misinformation, making it crucial for lawmakers to prioritize science-based policies to protect public health.
