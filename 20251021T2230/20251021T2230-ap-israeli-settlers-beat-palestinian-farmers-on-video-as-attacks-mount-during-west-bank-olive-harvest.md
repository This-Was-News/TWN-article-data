## Article summary
Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian olive harvesters and activists in the West Bank, injuring at least one woman. The incident, captured on video, occurred in Turmus Ayya during the olive harvest season, a time when Palestinian farmers face increased risks. The United Nations and rights groups have expressed concern over the escalating settler violence. Videos show masked settlers beating individuals with clubs and torching cars. Israeli authorities have been urged to address the violence, which has surged in recent years. The town of Turmus Ayya, predominantly Palestinian American, has been a frequent target of settler attacks, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war. Settler violence has seen a 13% increase in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, with over 150 attacks and 700 olive trees damaged in the first week of the harvest season. The West Bank, captured by Israel in 1967, remains a contentious area in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
