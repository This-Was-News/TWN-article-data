## Article summary
Construction has begun on a $250 million ballroom at the White House, initiated by President Donald Trump. The 90,000-square-foot ballroom, nearly double the size of the main White House, will accommodate 999 people and is funded entirely by private donations. The project involves demolishing part of the East Wing, which Trump initially denied. The ballroom is intended to replace the East Room for large events and will feature bulletproof windows. Despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, Trump has appointed a White House aide to oversee the project. The ballroom is expected to be completed before Trump's second term ends in January 2029. Trump has previously made significant changes to the White House, including redecorating the Oval Office and converting the Rose Garden into a patio. The ballroom project is part of a long tradition of presidential additions to the White House, some of which were initially criticized but later accepted.
