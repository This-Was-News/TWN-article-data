## Article summary
A federal judge has mandated the return of books about gender and race to school libraries on military bases in Kentucky, Virginia, Italy, and Japan. The order follows a lawsuit filed by 12 students who claimed their First Amendment rights were violated when nearly 600 books were removed. The removals were directed by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) in response to executive orders and memoranda issued by former President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. These directives prohibited materials promoting 'gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.' The removed books covered topics such as sexual identity, racism, and LGBTQ pride. Some schools also canceled events like Black History Month and Holocaust Remembrance Day. The judge ruled that the removals were politically motivated and ordered the immediate restoration of the books and curricular materials.
