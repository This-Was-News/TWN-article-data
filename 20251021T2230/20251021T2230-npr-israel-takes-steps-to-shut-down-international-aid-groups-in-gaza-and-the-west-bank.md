## Article summary
Israel has taken steps to shut down major international aid groups in Gaza and the West Bank, citing ideological reasons. The country has banned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) from sending aid and staff to Gaza and is now requiring all international aid groups to re-register under new criteria. This process has left many aid organizations in limbo, with some being rejected or not accepted. Israel claims these restrictions are necessary for security, but humanitarian officials say they are severely hindering aid efforts. The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war committed Israel to increasing aid, but the country continues to restrict crossings and who can send aid. The Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps are among the aid groups affected. Israel has approved a dozen NGOs that do not coordinate within traditional U.N.-led structures. The U.S. has stopped funding UNRWA, which was the biggest humanitarian organization in Gaza, leading to a significant funding gap.
