## Article summary
The Trump administration is using a 200-year-old Supreme Court precedent to justify deploying National Guard troops in Illinois. This precedent, Martin v. Mott, stems from a dispute over the seizure of a mare during the War of 1812 and asserts that the president's decision to federalize state militias is conclusive and cannot be second-guessed by judges. State and local officials in Illinois have challenged this deployment, arguing it infringes on state power. The administration contends that the deployment is authorized by federal law, citing protests near an immigration facility as a rebellion or a situation where regular forces are insufficient. The case hinges on interpreting the scope of presidential power and the relevance of the 1827 ruling to modern circumstances. Legal scholars and lower courts have differing views on whether the old precedent supports Trump's actions. The Supreme Court must now decide whether to allow the deployment to proceed, with implications for the balance of power between the federal government and the states.
