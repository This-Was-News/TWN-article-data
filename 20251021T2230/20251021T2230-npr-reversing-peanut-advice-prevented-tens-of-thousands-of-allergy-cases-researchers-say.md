## Article summary
A web page discusses how reversing previous advice on peanut consumption has significantly reduced peanut allergies in children. For years, parents were advised to avoid giving peanuts to babies to prevent allergies. However, a 2015 study found that early introduction of peanut products actually reduces the risk of developing allergies. This led to a change in pediatric guidelines, which has resulted in a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% reduction in overall food allergy prevalence among young children. The change in guidelines is estimated to have prevented at least 40,000 cases of peanut allergies in the past decade. The revised recommendations suggest introducing peanut products to high-risk infants as early as 4 to 6 months. Researchers analyzed health data from over 120,000 children to confirm these trends, although some experts caution about the study's limitations and the challenges in fully implementing the new guidelines.
