## Article summary
San Francisco leaders are rejecting President Trump's repeated threats to send National Guard troops to the city, asserting that crime is down and the city is recovering from the pandemic. Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that San Francisco is safe and capable of managing its own issues. Trump has previously deployed the National Guard to other cities like Washington D.C., Memphis, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland, citing crime concerns. Local residents and leaders in San Francisco are puzzled and concerned by Trump's threats, noting that the city has made significant strides in reducing crime and improving public safety. The city has seen a 21% increase in office visits and rising home rental prices, indicating economic recovery. Despite some persistent issues in certain neighborhoods, overall crime has decreased by over 26% compared to the previous year. Governor Gavin Newsom's administration and Attorney General Rob Bonta have vowed to push back against any federal deployment of the National Guard, similar to their response in Los Angeles. San Francisco voters have also taken steps to enhance public safety by approving the use of advanced technology for crime-fighting and electing a tougher district attorney.
