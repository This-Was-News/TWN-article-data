## Article summary
President Trump is criticizing air traffic controllers who have called out of work during the ongoing government shutdown, during which they are working without pay. In a social media post, Trump stated he was "NOT HAPPY" with those who took time off and warned that they would be "substantially 'docked.'" He suggested a $10,000 bonus for controllers who did not take any time off, calling them "GREAT PATRIOTS." Trump also stated that any controllers wishing to quit should do so, as they would be "quickly replaced by true Patriots," despite the lengthy training required for new controllers. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association reported that the majority of controllers continue to work demanding jobs without compensation, often working six-day weeks. This situation has exacerbated an existing shortage of air traffic controllers. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has already begun reducing flights by up to 10% at 40 major airports due to the controller shortage, leading to thousands of flight cancellations and delays over the weekend. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg criticized Trump's comments, stating the President "has no business s***ting on them now" after the administration's treatment of the controllers. Travelers have experienced significant disruptions, with flights being canceled and delayed, causing frustration and uncertainty.
