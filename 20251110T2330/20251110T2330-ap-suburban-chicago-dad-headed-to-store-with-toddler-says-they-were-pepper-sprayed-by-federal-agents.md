## Article summary
A suburban Chicago father, Rafael Veraza, alleges that he and his 1-year-old daughter were pepper-sprayed by federal immigration agents in a Sam's Club parking lot in Cicero. The incident occurred amidst escalating clashes between agents and residents in the area, particularly in the Mexican enclave of Little Village. Veraza stated that a masked agent sprayed their car through an open window as they were leaving, affecting both him and his daughter. A local pastor, Rev. Matt DeMateo, corroborated the account, providing video evidence. However, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied deploying crowd control or pepper spray in the parking lot. DHS claimed agents were conducting operations when they encountered a hostile crowd, with protesters allegedly throwing objects and firing shots at vehicles, leading to the arrest of eight U.S. citizens. This incident occurs as federal agents have been criticized for aggressive tactics in the Chicago area, including the use of chemical agents in various public spaces. A federal judge had previously issued an injunction limiting the use of force by agents, which DHS has appealed. The tensions highlight ongoing conflicts surrounding immigration enforcement and community responses.
