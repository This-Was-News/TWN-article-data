## Article summary
Republicans are pushing for swift approval of a bipartisan deal to end the longest government shutdown in US history, now in its 41st day. The Senate cleared a major hurdle with a 60-40 vote, supported by Republicans and a group of eight Democrats who broke ranks with their party. Senate Majority Leader John Thune urged colleagues to pass the bill quickly, stating that people have suffered long enough. Speaker Mike Johnson has called House members back to Capitol Hill, though action there isn't expected until Wednesday at the earliest. President Trump has approved the plan, calling it "very good" and promising to "be opening up our country very quickly." Many Democrats are unhappy that the deal doesn't include their central demand: extending health insurance subsidies set to expire at year's end. The compromise includes funding the government through January and specific bills for agriculture, military construction, and legislative agencies through most of 2026. It also reverses federal worker layoffs during the shutdown and ensures retroactive pay. Democrats are divided, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opposing the package. The deal also addresses potential government lawsuits over phone records of senators related to the January 6th investigation and includes provisions that could impact air travel disruptions, which have already led to significant flight cancellations.
