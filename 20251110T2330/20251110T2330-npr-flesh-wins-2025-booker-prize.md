## Article summary
David Szalay's novel 'Flesh' has won the 2025 Booker Prize, an award that celebrates the best English-language novels published in the U.K. The book, Szalay's sixth, follows the life of a Hungarian-British man from his teenage years into middle age, using spare and sparse language. The judges praised the novel for its unique use of white space, inviting readers to actively participate in creating the character. Szalay, who has previously been shortlisted for the Booker Prize, drew inspiration from his own experiences living between Hungary and England, aiming to explore life as a physical experience. 'Flesh' was selected from a shortlist of six books. The Booker Prize comes with a £50,000 award and typically boosts sales for the winning novel. Szalay's win highlights his distinct narrative style and his exploration of cultural and economic divides in contemporary Europe.
