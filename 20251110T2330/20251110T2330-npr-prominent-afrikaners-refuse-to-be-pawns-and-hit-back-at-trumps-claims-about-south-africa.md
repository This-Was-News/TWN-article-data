## Article summary
President Trump has announced that no U.S. officials will attend the G20 Summit hosted by South Africa, citing "human rights" concerns and falsely claiming that "white persecution" and land confiscation are occurring. Prominent Afrikaners, including writers, journalists, and clergy, have publicly rejected these claims, stating they are not victims and do not want to be used as "pawns" in American political agendas. These Afrikaners acknowledge their ancestors' role in past injustices but assert that post-apartheid South Africa is dedicated to building the country, with constitutional protections for all citizens. They emphasize that no white-owned land has been confiscated since 1994 and that statistics show Black South Africans are most affected by violent crime. Some Afrikaner agricultural organizations have also warned that U.S. sanctions would harm their businesses. While some Afrikaner groups support Trump's stance, the South African government has expressed that the U.S. absence will negatively impact the U.S. itself, not the G20 summit, which will proceed with leaders from Europe and China. The U.S. State Department has objected to the summit's theme of "solidarity, equality and sustainability."
