## Article summary
A new report from the National Association of Realtors highlights the growing difficulty for first-time homebuyers to enter the housing market. Only about one in five homes sold in the past year went to a first-time buyer, a record low. The average age of a first-time homebuyer has reached an all-time high of 40 years old. This trend is attributed to a combination of high home prices and elevated mortgage rates, making it challenging for younger individuals and couples to save for down payments and afford monthly payments. Many existing homeowners, benefiting from lower mortgage rates, are choosing to stay in their homes longer, further reducing the available inventory. This creates a "gridlock" in the market, as cited by Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist for the Realtors' association. The report also notes that potential buyers are burdened by other rising costs and existing debts, such as student and medical loans, which impede their ability to save. Consequently, many aspiring homeowners are delaying their plans, pushing back their expected home-buying timelines by several years. This situation is causing frustration and concern among those who hoped to achieve homeownership at a younger age, a milestone that was more attainable for previous generations.
