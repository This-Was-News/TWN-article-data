## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear a case brought by Kim Davis, a former Kentucky clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses. This challenge sought to revisit the court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized gay marriage nationwide. Davis, who was previously jailed for contempt of court and ordered to pay a significant sum to a couple she refused to marry, argued that her religious beliefs conflicted with the ruling. She petitioned the court, asserting her case was of exceptional importance as she was the first individual jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the traditional definition of marriage. Despite her arguments, the Supreme Court declined her petition without comment. This decision effectively reaffirms the constitutionality of same-sex marriage for the time being. However, the issue remains a point of contention, with at least nine states considering bills or resolutions critical of Obergefell this year. Furthermore, Justice Clarence Thomas has explicitly stated that the Supreme Court should reconsider its rulings on same-sex marriage. Even if Obergefell were overturned, same-sex marriages would still be protected federally by the Respect for Marriage Act, though individual states could potentially refuse recognition.
