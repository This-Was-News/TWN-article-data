## Article summary
Democratic unity has fractured following the party's recent election victories, primarily due to internal divisions over the age of its leaders and the strategy for confronting Republicans. The issue has been exacerbated by the decision of eight Democratic-aligned senators, with an average age of around 70, to vote with Republicans to end a 40-day government shutdown without securing key health care concessions. This move has ignited anger within the party, highlighting concerns about older politicians' decision-making and their connection to the party's base. The article points to Joe Biden's decision to seek re-election at 79 as a prominent example of age-related concerns. Furthermore, it notes that several of the senators who voted for the shutdown deal are nearing or have passed traditional retirement age, with two not seeking re-election. This situation underscores a growing tension between the party's established leadership and its more restless, liberal base, who are increasingly questioning the age and vigor of their representatives in Washington.
