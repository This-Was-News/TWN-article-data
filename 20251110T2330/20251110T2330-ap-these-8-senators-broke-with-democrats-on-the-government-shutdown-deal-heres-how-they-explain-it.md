## Article summary
Eight senators broke ranks with Democrats to vote for a compromise bill to reopen the government, facing immediate criticism from within their party. These senators, including several retiring members and former governors, explained their decision was driven by a desire to end the shutdown's impact on Americans. Key concerns addressed in the compromise included extending health insurance subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and fully funding the SNAP program, while also reversing mass firings of federal workers. Senators like Jeanne Shaheen and Dick Durbin highlighted the need to address these issues immediately, even if the bill wasn't perfect. Tim Kaine emphasized the importance of preventing further mass layoffs. Maggie Hassan and Angus King pointed to the urgent need to help families struggling with food insecurity and the ineffectiveness of using shutdowns as a negotiating tactic. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto underscored the detrimental economic effects on their home state of Nevada, particularly on travel and food assistance. John Fetterman also expressed regret over the situation, noting the unpaid federal workers and military.
