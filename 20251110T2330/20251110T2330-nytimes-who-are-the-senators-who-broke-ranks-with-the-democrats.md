## Article summary
Eight senators from the Democratic caucus broke ranks with their party to vote with Republicans on Sunday, advancing legislation aimed at ending the government shutdown. This compromise measure passed with a 60-to-40 vote, contingent on a pledge from Senate Majority Leader John Thune to allow a vote in December on extending expiring health care subsidies, a key Democratic demand. However, many Democrats expressed skepticism about this promise, deeming it insufficient to secure their votes, especially given the Republican-controlled Congress. Three senators—Angus King, John Fetterman, and Catherine Cortez Masto—had previously supported a Republican stopgap bill. Five others joined them on Sunday, drawing criticism from colleagues who felt the party should have maintained a firmer stance. The bill still requires approval in the Senate, passage in the House, and the President's signature to end the shutdown. Among the eight senators who voted for the measure, none face re-election in 2026, and two are retiring at the end of their terms. Senator Angus King highlighted the shutdown's impact as a driver for the compromise. Senator Tim Kaine supported the deal after securing provisions for furloughed workers. Senator Dick Durbin, who is retiring, noted the bill's inclusion of measures to reverse layoffs. Senator John Fetterman reiterated his consistent opposition to government shutdowns, apologizing for the unpaid workers. Senators Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen emphasized the need for bipartisan negotiations and saw the bill as a path to reopening the government. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, while defending their votes, also criticized Republicans for their tactics during the shutdown, citing issues like withheld food stamp benefits and flight reductions.
