## Article summary
The U.S. has agreed with Qatar to build a training facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, sparking controversy. The facility will support Qatari troops training on F-15QA jets purchased through a U.S. program. This agreement is part of common international training practices, with other countries like Singapore and Germany also using U.S. bases for training. The base, located near Boise, is ideal for fighter pilot training due to its spacious surroundings. Local workers will construct and support the new facilities, funded by Qatar. Security will remain under U.S. control. The base houses the 366th Fighter Wing and several squadrons, including a Singaporean unit. Qatar's decision to buy the jets in 2017 led to discussions about training. Environmental assessments were completed in 2022. Critics, like Laura Loomer, oppose foreign military presence on U.S. soil. Past incidents, such as a 2019 shooting by a Saudi trainee, have raised concerns. The U.S. uses defense sales as a foreign policy tool to enhance global security and support allied readiness.
