## Article summary
President Trump announced on Saturday that he had found funds to pay military troops on October 15, despite the government shutdown and Congress not approving new military funding. The White House budget office stated the funds would come from previously approved Pentagon research and development funds but provided no further details. Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use these funds to ensure troops are paid. Trump criticized Democrats for holding the military hostage with the government shutdown. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Typically, troops do not receive wages during a government shutdown, often prompting Congress to broker a spending deal. Trump's actions seem unorthodox but aim to prevent financial hardship for over 1 million active-duty service members. Republican leaders argued that passing the stopgap bill would fund the military, but Senate Democrats have not approved it. Without White House intervention, military personnel would have missed their October 15 paycheck.
