## Article summary
Federal judges have expressed concerns about the Supreme Court's emergency orders, which they believe are causing a 'judicial crisis' and damaging the judiciary's public image. Over three dozen judges shared their views with The New York Times, highlighting confusion and practical impacts of these orders. The orders, related to Trump administration policies, have allowed actions like deportations and military discharges. The critique reveals strains in the federal judicial system due to litigation over Trump's agenda. Sixty-five judges responded to a Times questionnaire, with 47 criticizing the Supreme Court's handling of its emergency docket. The judges spoke anonymously due to rules limiting their public statements.
