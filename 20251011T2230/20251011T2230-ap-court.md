## Article summary
A federal appeals court ruled that National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Trump can remain in the state but cannot be deployed for now. This decision follows a lower court's temporary block on their deployment, citing a lack of evidence of impending rebellion. The troops were sent as part of a broader political and legal dispute over Trump's efforts to deploy the National Guard to several U.S. cities, claiming rampant crime despite conflicting statistics. The judge noted that civil authorities have been effective in maintaining order and that military intervention is not warranted. The troops, primarily from Texas and Illinois, were stationed at a U.S. Army Reserve Center and an ICE facility. The case has seen multiple legal twists, with the appeals court pausing further action until more arguments can be heard.
