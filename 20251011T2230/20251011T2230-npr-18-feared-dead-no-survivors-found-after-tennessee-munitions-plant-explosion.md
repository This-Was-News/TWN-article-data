## Article summary
An explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) plant in Tennessee has left multiple people dead and missing. The blast occurred near the Hickman and Humphreys County line, and the cause is still under investigation. As of the latest update, 16 individuals are unaccounted for, and no survivors have been recovered. Over 300 people are involved in the search and rescue efforts, with the TBI using rapid DNA equipment to identify remains. Authorities are not ruling out foul play and are conducting controlled detonations to stabilize the site. AES is assisting the families of the workers, and community vigils are planned. The explosion was felt and heard by residents in nearby areas, causing significant shock and damage. AES processes explosives for military, commercial, and aerospace industries, handling large amounts of TNT and other explosive products. The company has had a significant contract relationship with the federal government since 2018. The community has faced multiple tragic disasters in recent years, including a gas pipeline explosion and a devastating flood.
