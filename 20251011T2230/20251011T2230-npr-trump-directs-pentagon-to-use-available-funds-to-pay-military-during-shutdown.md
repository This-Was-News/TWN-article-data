## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he has directed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to use available funds to ensure active military personnel receive their paychecks on October 15, despite the ongoing government shutdown. Trump stated that he is using his authority as Commander in Chief to allocate these funds, which are expected to come from research and development funding within the Defense Department. The move comes as Congress remains deadlocked over negotiations to reopen the federal government. Secretary Hegseth reposted Trump's announcement on X, emphasizing the President's commitment to the troops. A White House official confirmed that the Defense Department has the necessary funds available for two years but did not specify the exact amount. Trump had previously assured military personnel that they would be paid despite the shutdown, stating at a Navy event in Norfolk, Virginia, that service members would receive every last penny they are owed.
