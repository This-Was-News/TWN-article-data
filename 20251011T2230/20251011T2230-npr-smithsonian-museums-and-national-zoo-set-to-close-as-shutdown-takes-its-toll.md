## Article summary
The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are set to close starting October 12 due to the ongoing government shutdown. The closure affects all 21 Smithsonian museums, research centers, and the National Zoo. While the animals will continue to be cared for, the zoo's animal cams will be turned off. The Smithsonian, which relies on federal funding for about 62% of its budget, had initially stayed open using prior-year funds but has now exhausted those resources. The shutdown has also led to the closure of some national parks and the issuance of layoff notices to thousands of federal employees across various agencies.
