## Article summary
The federal government shutdown, now in its second week, is starting to impact various segments of Americans. Key medical services for Native American communities have been curtailed, veterans have lost access to career counseling, and taxpayers face delays in IRS services. Farmers are struggling to plan next year's crops due to uncertainty about federal assistance. Over 4,000 federal employees have been laid off, and about 600,000 workers are furloughed or working without pay. President Trump has intensified pressure on Democrats, threatening to withhold back pay from some federal workers. The shutdown has also affected construction projects, air traffic control, and nutrition programs for low-income families. The impasse in Congress shows no signs of resolution, deepening the strain on affected communities.
