## Article summary
Israeli fire in the West Bank has killed at least eighteen children under 15 this year, with many more killed in previous years. The killings have risen as Israeli military operations have increased since the outbreak of the war against Hamas in Gaza. Families of the victims have shared their stories, detailing the tragic circumstances of their children's deaths. Some children were killed during military raids, while others were shot in peaceful areas. The Israeli military maintains that it does not intentionally target civilians and has launched investigations into some cases. However, families have received little information about the incidents and doubt there will be any accountability. The stories highlight the devastating impact of the conflict on Palestinian families and the lack of transparency and justice in the aftermath of these tragedies.
