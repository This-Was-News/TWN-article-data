## Article summary
The Supreme Court is set to confront a series of cases central to President Trump's agenda as it returns to the bench. The court will hear arguments on the legality of Trump's sweeping tariffs, his efforts to control independent agencies, and his attempt to fire a Federal Reserve Board member. The term will also include cases on birthright citizenship, gender identity, and voting rights. The court's conservative majority has frequently sided with the Trump administration in emergency orders, but this term will see final judgments on the legality of his policies. The court will also address challenges to state laws affecting transgender rights and voting regulations. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. will preside over a term that could define his legacy, with the court's decisions having significant implications for presidential power and the nation's political landscape.
