## Article summary
Two years after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, a potential turning point in the war may be approaching. Hamas has partially agreed to a 20-point plan introduced by the White House to end the fighting in Gaza, while Israel has conditionally accepted the plan's first phase, tying a limited troop pullback to a hostage handover. Delegations from Israel, Hamas, the United States, and mediators from Egypt and Qatar are set to meet in Sharm El Sheikh to discuss the ceasefire. The White House's proposal aims to end the war immediately upon acceptance by both sides, with Israeli forces pulling back to allow for hostage transfers. All 48 hostages, living and deceased, are to be returned within 72 hours of the agreement, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. However, Hamas and Israeli officials have differing conditions and expectations, with Hamas pressing for adjustments and Israel demanding verifiable releases and security guarantees. The plan leaves several questions unanswered, including the full withdrawal of Israeli forces and the establishment of an international security force. Many Israelis support the ceasefire proposal, with families of hostages being among the most vocal advocates. Despite cautious optimism, there are doubts and fears that the war could resume under new conditions. If the talks succeed, the first hostages could be freed within days, potentially marking the beginning of the end of the war.
