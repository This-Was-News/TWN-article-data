## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court's new term, beginning Monday, will heavily focus on presidential powers. Key cases include challenges to the Voting Rights Act, campaign fundraising limits, Trump tariffs, and the firing of independent agency commissioners. The court's conservative majority has frequently granted Trump's emergency requests, often without explanation. Some cases are now back for full hearings, including those involving the structure of government and the firing of Federal Trade Commissioners. The court will also address Trump's tariffs and the firing of a Federal Reserve Governor. Other cases involve free speech rights and transgender students in school sports. The term is marked by tensions among justices and declining public approval ratings. The court's decisions will significantly impact the balance of power between the executive branch and other institutions.
