## Article summary
Women tend to live longer than men, with a gap that widened to 5.8 years in the U.S. in 2021. A study from the Max Planck Institute found that females live longer in 72% of 528 mammal species, including humans. Factors like genetics, risky behaviors, and caretaking responsibilities contribute to this gap. Females have two X chromosomes, providing a genetic advantage, while males engage in riskier behaviors that shorten their lifespan. Men are more likely to die from alcoholism, drug use, suicide, and homicide. They also have higher rates of heart disease and cancer due to smoking and less preventive care. Men's skin is more vulnerable to sun damage, and they are less likely to use sunscreen or screen for cancers. The study suggests that men can narrow the longevity gap by adopting healthier habits, such as regular doctor visits and better sun protection. Changing behaviors and norms can help reduce the gap, with both men and women benefiting from preventive care and healthier lifestyles.
