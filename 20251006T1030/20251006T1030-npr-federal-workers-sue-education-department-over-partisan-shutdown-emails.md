## Article summary
A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting partisan language into Department of Education employees' out-of-office email messages, blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. The lawsuit argues this violates the First Amendment by compelling speech. The messages were changed without employees' consent and differed from the department's initial guidance. The lawsuit names the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon as defendants. Government ethics experts suggest this may violate the Hatch Act, which limits political activity by civil servants. Rep. Robert Garcia has asked the Office of Special Counsel to investigate. Multiple federal workers have expressed concern about the politicized language in official communications. The Department of Veterans Affairs also sent a newsletter blaming Democrats for the shutdown, which some veterans found inappropriate. The Education Department defended the messages, while the VA press secretary called the newsletter's content factual.
