## Article summary
A federal judge in Oregon blocked the Trump administration from deploying out-of-state National Guard troops, even as President Trump sought troops from Texas to send to Democratic cities like Chicago and Portland. The judge, Karin Immergut, broadened her restraining order to cover any National Guard deployment in Oregon, accusing the administration of circumventing her initial order. The Trump administration had attempted to send California National Guard troops to Oregon and deployed Texas troops to multiple cities, drawing criticism from governors and legal challenges. Governors of California, Oregon, and Illinois condemned the deployments as abuses of power and illegal. The judge ruled that the protests in Portland were not significantly violent, and the Trump administration appealed. The president's actions have escalated tensions and drawn legal scrutiny, with critics arguing that the deployments are politically motivated and unlawful.
