## Article summary
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Oregon, following a rapid series of legal actions. Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by Trump, granted a restraining order after the administration attempted to send troops from California and Texas, just hours after her initial ruling. The judge questioned the administration's actions, suggesting they were circumventing her order. The protests in Portland, which have been small and sporadic, have been exaggerated by Trump, who described the city as a war zone. Local officials argue that the situation is not as dire as portrayed and that the city has seen improvements under new leadership. The administration's deployment of troops from other states was seen as an attempt to bypass the judge's initial order. The temporary order is set to expire in 14 days, with further hearings scheduled. Oregon's governor and California's attorney general criticized Trump's actions, calling them an overreach of presidential authority. Portland's mayor also condemned the federal agents' use of force during protests, describing it as unjustified and inflammatory.
