## Article summary
President Donald Trump's administration has directed the National Park Service to review and potentially alter historical interpretations at national parks, aiming to present a more positive narrative of American history. This directive has sparked concerns about historical revisionism, particularly regarding the portrayal of slavery and other difficult aspects of the nation's past. At Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, the complex history of slavery and abolitionist John Brown's raid is being carefully navigated. Descendants of those involved, like Brianna Wheeler, emphasize the importance of accurately portraying the past. While some changes have been noted, such as the removal of climate change references at Acadia National Park, the full extent of alterations remains unclear. The Smithsonian Institution has also faced pressure to modify its exhibits. The National Park Service maintains that its goal is accuracy and balance, not censorship. The debate highlights the tension between presenting a sanitized history and confronting the nation's challenging truths.
