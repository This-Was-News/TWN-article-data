## Article summary
Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois criticized federal immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago, particularly a late-night Border Patrol raid at an apartment building where residents were restrained with zip ties. He accused federal agents of creating a war zone by targeting people based on their race and not focusing on serious criminals as promised. Pritzker also mentioned reports of children, some nearly naked, and elderly people being detained, some of whom he believed were U.S. citizens. He directed state agencies to investigate the incident and questioned the Trump administration's plans to send 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, suggesting it was an attempt to escalate tensions. Additionally, Pritzker expressed concerns about a recent shooting involving a federal agent and a motorist, criticizing the lack of transparency in the incident.
