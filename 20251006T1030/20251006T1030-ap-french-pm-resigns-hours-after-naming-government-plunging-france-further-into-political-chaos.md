## Article summary
French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu resigned less than 24 hours after naming his government and after less than a month in office, causing a deep political crisis. President Emmanuel Macron accepted his resignation, making Lecornu the fourth prime minister in a year. Lecornu cited the inability to build a consensus as his reason for resigning, emphasizing the need for selflessness and humility. Political opponents, including the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed, called for Macron's resignation or new elections. The resignation caused market instability, with the CAC-40 index dropping nearly 2%. Lecornu's ministerial choices were criticized, particularly the reappointment of Bruno Le Maire. France faces a massive debt crisis, with public debt at 114% of GDP. Key cabinet positions remained unchanged from the previous government. French politics have been fragmented since Macron called snap elections last year, resulting in a divided legislature. Lecornu had sought consensus and promised not to use special constitutional powers to force budgets through Parliament.
