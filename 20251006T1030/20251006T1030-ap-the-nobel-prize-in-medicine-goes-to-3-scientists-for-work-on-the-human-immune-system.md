## Article summary
The Nobel Prize in medicine has been awarded to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their groundbreaking work on the human immune system, specifically peripheral immune tolerance. Their discoveries have paved the way for new treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and improved transplantation success. The laureates include Brunkow, a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology, Ramsdell, a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics, and Sakaguchi, a distinguished professor at Osaka University. Sakaguchi's 1995 discovery of regulatory T cells (T-regs) was a pivotal moment. Brunkow and Ramsdell later identified a crucial gene, Foxp3, linked to autoimmune diseases. Sakaguchi connected these findings, showing that Foxp3 controls the development of T-regs, which regulate other T cells to prevent overreactions. Their work has significantly advanced the understanding of the immune system and its role in preventing autoimmune diseases. The award, announced by the Karolinska Institute, includes a prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor. The Nobel announcements will continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, followed by chemistry, literature, the Nobel Peace Prize, and the economics prize. The award ceremony will be held on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.
