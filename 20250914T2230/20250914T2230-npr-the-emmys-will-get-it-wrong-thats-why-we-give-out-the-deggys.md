## Article summary
The Emmys, set to air on Sunday, celebrate television excellence, but critic Eric Deggans argues that the awards often miss the mark. He presents his own Deggy awards to honor shows and performances that he believes deserve recognition. Deggans highlights 'Andor' for its meticulously crafted drama and standout performances, 'The Residence' for its unique take on a White House murder mystery, and 'Adolescence' for its powerful exploration of teen issues. He also praises 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' for its quality satire and advocates for its continuation. Deggans questions the relevance of TV awards in today's world but believes ambitious and creative shows can still have a significant impact. He criticizes the Emmys for their confusing rules and predicts that 'The White Lotus' will win despite his preference for 'Andor'. Deggans also awards a special Deggy to Questlove for his remarkable musical direction in a documentary.
