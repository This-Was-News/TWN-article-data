## Article summary
Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, a prominent GOP foreign affairs hawk, announced his retirement while warning about the potential for World War III due to Russia's escalation in Ukraine. He discussed the recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace, which NATO intercepted, and expressed concern about the rising tensions. McCaul has long advocated for a tougher stance against Russia and believes President Vladimir Putin is not negotiating in good faith. He criticized President Donald Trump's praise for Putin and suggested that Putin is manipulating Trump. McCaul, a former anti-terrorism prosecutor and past chairman of the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committee, is part of an older generation of foreign policy hawks. He will finish his term but is seeking a new challenge in national security and foreign policy. McCaul is one of at least 10 House members retiring without seeking higher office, including fellow GOP hawk Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska.
