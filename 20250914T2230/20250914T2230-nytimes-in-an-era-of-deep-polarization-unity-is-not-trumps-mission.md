## Article summary
President Trump's response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk deviated from traditional presidential norms, blaming the left and vowing revenge. Unlike past presidents who sought to unite the nation in times of crisis, Trump escalated divisions, focusing on his base and portraying opponents as enemies. He has consistently governed as president of 'red America,' targeting Democrats, wayward Republicans, and other perceived adversaries. Trump's approach reflects his us-against-them worldview, prioritizing conflict over unity. While other presidents have aspired to transcend partisanship, Trump has embraced division as a defining characteristic of his presidency. His actions, such as withholding disaster relief from Democratic states and threatening to deploy troops in Democratic cities, underscore this strategy. Critics fear he will use Kirk's assassination to further target liberal institutions. Trump's rhetoric and policies have deepened polarization, with his supporters and opponents locked in a bitter struggle. His presidency marks a stark departure from traditional notions of presidential leadership, emphasizing division over unity.
