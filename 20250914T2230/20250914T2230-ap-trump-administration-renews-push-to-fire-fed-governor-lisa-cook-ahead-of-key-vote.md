## Article summary
The Trump administration is pushing to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ahead of a key interest rate vote. The administration filed a response to the U.S. Court of Appeals, arguing that Cook's legal arguments to remain in her position are meritless. Cook's lawyers contend that the administration has not shown sufficient cause for her removal and warn of potential economic risks. This is the first time in the Fed's history that a president has attempted to remove a governor. The dispute centers on allegations by Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee, who accused Cook of mortgage fraud. Cook referred to a property as a vacation home in a loan estimate, which could undermine the fraud claims. The Trump administration relies on these allegations to justify her removal. Cook sued to block her firing, and a federal judge ruled that her removal was illegal, reinstating her to the Fed's board. The administration appealed and requested an emergency ruling before the Fed's meeting to decide on interest rates, with most economists expecting a rate cut.
