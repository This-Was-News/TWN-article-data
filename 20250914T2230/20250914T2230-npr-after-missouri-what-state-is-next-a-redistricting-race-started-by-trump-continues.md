## Article summary
Missouri is the latest state to redraw its voting map to benefit Republicans, with the state Senate approving a plan requested by President Trump to help Republicans win a seat currently held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. The plan, expected to be signed by Republican Governor Mike Kehoe, has been criticized by Democrats for diluting the votes of Black voters, particularly in Kansas City. Two lawsuits have already been filed against the plan, and a voter petition drive is being organized to block it. Trump has initiated a nationwide redistricting race, urging other Republican-led states like Texas, Indiana, and Florida to redraw their maps to help Republicans maintain their majority in the U.S. House. This is crucial for Trump's agenda and to protect his administration from potential investigations by a Democratic-led House. California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has countered by proposing a map to help Democrats win five seats, which will go to voters for approval. Other states like Illinois, Maryland, and New York are also considering redistricting, while Ohio and Utah face court-ordered redraws due to legal issues with their current maps. Gerrymandering, the practice of drawing district lines to favor a party, is legal in many states but can lead to polarized and gridlocked Congresses. However, it is illegal to gerrymander to dilute the voting power of racial groups, a practice that could be reconsidered by the U.S. Supreme Court in an upcoming case.
