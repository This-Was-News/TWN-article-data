## Article summary
The Trump administration has requested $58 million in emergency funding from Congress to enhance security for the Supreme Court, citing increased threats against public officials following the killing of conservative activist Charles Kirk. The funds would be allocated to the U.S. Marshals Service for additional protective operations for the justices. The request highlights growing concerns about political violence and the safety of high-profile government figures. The administration also acknowledged potential threats to Congress and urged lawmakers to consider additional resources for the Capitol Police and other security measures. Security for lawmakers has seen significant changes since the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, but incidents of threats and violence persist. Lawmakers are expected to discuss increased security spending when they return to Washington. Speaker Mike Johnson has been approached by lawmakers from both parties about security concerns, which he partly attributes to heated political rhetoric. Both Democratic and Republican leaders have used the term 'fascist' to attack political opponents, contributing to the tense atmosphere. The administration supports increasing funding for security measures for the legislative branch and defers to Congress on the best approach to achieve this.
