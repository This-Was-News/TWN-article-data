## Article summary
Utah Governor Spencer Cox revealed that the suspect in the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Tyler Robinson, held leftist ideology and had been radicalized. Robinson, a 22-year-old who dropped out of college, was described as a normal young man who became radicalized after moving back to his hometown. Cox noted that Robinson spent much of his time online, immersed in gaming and message boards. The suspect's motive remains unclear, with intense debate and speculation surrounding his political views. Robinson's romantic partner, who is transitioning from male to female, is cooperating fully with investigators and was shocked by the shooting. The partner had no prior knowledge of the crime. Cox mentioned that investigators are examining a potential note left by Robinson and that formal charges are expected on Tuesday. Kirk, an outspoken conservative, was known for his controversial views on race, gun control, abortion, and transgender rights. He was fatally shot while answering a question about transgender people and mass shootings at Utah Valley University. Robinson's family, registered Republicans, expressed surprise at his political leanings, which differed from their conservative beliefs.
