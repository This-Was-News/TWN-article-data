## Article summary
Republican leaders in the House and Senate have rejected Democratic demands for an immediate extension of health care subsidies, challenging Democrats to vote against a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government open. Senate Majority Leader John Thune urged Democrats to work with Republicans or risk a government shutdown. Democratic leaders, however, have not backed down, arguing that Republicans must negotiate with them to pass the spending bill. Democrats warn that excluding them from the process is not acceptable and that a shutdown would have significant consequences for federal employees. House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized Democrats for trying to insert unrelated matters into the funding bill. The GOP bill includes increased security funding for lawmakers and other officials. Democrats have threatened to unveil an alternate proposal but have not done so yet. Former President Trump has dismissed Democratic threats, suggesting they would not vote for any agreement. Democrats argue that Trump's stance signals a desire for a shutdown, which they believe would be his responsibility.
