## Article summary
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point, with one governor advocating for a larger reduction. This marks the first rate cut since December, bringing the range to 4 to 4.25 percent. The decision was divisive, reflecting ongoing debates about balancing inflation and labor market risks. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a risk management strategy to support the economy amid rising labor market vulnerabilities. Job growth has slowed significantly, with monthly gains averaging just 29,000 in recent months. Powell acknowledged that immigration restrictions have contributed to labor market challenges. Projections indicate further rate cuts this year, with officials expecting rates to drop to a range of 3.5 to 3.75 percent by year-end. The Fed also anticipates economic growth of 1.6 percent this year and a slight rise in unemployment to 4.5 percent. Inflation is expected to decrease to 2.6 percent by the end of 2026, with a return to the 2 percent target by 2028. The Fed faces political pressures from President Trump, including attempts to remove a governor and influence rate decisions. Powell emphasized the Fed's commitment to independence and long-term economic stability.
