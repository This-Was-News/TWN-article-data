## Article summary
Senator Bill Cassidy, chairman of the Senate health committee, expressed skepticism about changes to childhood vaccine guidance by advisers appointed by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Cassidy doubted the public's confidence in any new recommendations from the panel, which was recently reconstituted by Kennedy. The panel, which advises on vaccine schedules, is meeting to discuss vaccines for Covid-19, hepatitis B, and measles. Cassidy emphasized the importance of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, noting its success in reducing cases from 20,000 to around 20 annually. He warned that removing the vaccine from the recommended schedule could create financial hardships for patients. Former CDC head Susan Monarez testified that Kennedy directed her to approve recommendations without considering scientific evidence and to dismiss scientists who opposed his views. She cautioned that weakening vaccine protections could lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases. The panel's decisions influence state mandates for school vaccinations and insurance coverage.
