## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed lawsuits against Oregon and Maine, seeking access to their voter registration lists, including sensitive personal information like partial Social Security numbers. The DOJ claims the states have not provided complete answers or sufficient evidence to determine compliance with federal laws on maintaining accurate voter lists. Oregon Secretary of State Tobias Read and Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, both Democrats, have criticized the DOJ's actions, citing concerns over privacy, constitutional issues, and political motivations. The DOJ's requests have raised alarms among election officials, who question the administration's intentions and the security of the data. The DOJ's demands follow a pattern of seeking more stringent voter list maintenance, a topic that has long been contentious, with some advocating for more aggressive list purging. The DOJ's actions have been met with resistance from multiple states, and it remains unclear whether further legal action will be taken against them. The DOJ's requests come amid concerns about the administration's use of voter data and its collaboration with other federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, which has been involved in citizenship verification efforts.
