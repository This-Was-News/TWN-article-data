## Article summary
A new study published in JAMA Dermatology found that Vitamin B3 supplements, specifically nicotinamide, can reduce the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer recurrences. The study involved nearly 34,000 veterans and showed a 54% reduced risk for those who took 500 mg twice daily for at least a month after their first skin cancer diagnosis. Overall, participants saw a 14% reduction in skin cancer risk, with the most significant reduction in squamous cell cancers. Doctors have been recommending B3 supplements since a 2015 Australian study showed similar benefits. Dermatologist Sarah Arron now strongly recommends nicotinamide for skin cancer patients, especially after their first diagnosis, due to its minimal adverse effects. The supplement is widely available over the counter, and Arron advises choosing the 'amide' form. While the study did not address melanoma risk or prevention for those without a skin cancer history, Arron suggests potential benefits for high-risk individuals. Topical B3 products may have aesthetic benefits but their role in cancer prevention is unclear. The best prevention strategy remains sunscreen use and protective clothing.
