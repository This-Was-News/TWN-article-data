## Article summary
San Francisco supervisor Joel Engardio was recalled after converting a coastal highway into a car-free park called Sunset Dunes, despite opposition from his constituents. Engardio, a crime victims advocate, became the fifth official to be ousted in a recall vote in four years. He conceded, standing by his decision, praising the park's environmental and economic benefits. The recall reflects San Francisco's changing dynamics and the electorate's dissatisfaction with certain policies. The Sunset neighborhood, with a high population of Chinese families, relies heavily on cars, leading to concerns about traffic safety and quality of life. Recall backers argued that Engardio ignored constituent concerns. The recall effort was supported by those who previously ousted three liberal school board members and District Attorney Chesa Boudin. Engardio had proposed a permanent car ban on the Great Highway, which passed citywide but failed in his district. Mayor Daniel Lurie, a moderate Democrat, will now appoint a replacement for Engardio, who was up for reelection next year.
