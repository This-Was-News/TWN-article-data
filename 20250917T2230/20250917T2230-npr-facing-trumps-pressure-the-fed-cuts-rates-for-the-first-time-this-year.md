## Article summary
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point to support the U.S. job market, which has shown signs of slowing down. This move comes amid pressure from President Trump, who has been advocating for lower interest rates and has taken steps to influence the Fed's composition. Trump recently appointed a White House economist to the Fed's governing board and attempted to remove another member, Fed Governor Lisa Cook, though her dismissal has been temporarily blocked. If Trump succeeds in replacing Cook, his appointees would hold a majority on the Fed's board, potentially compromising its independence. The Fed has been cautious about cutting rates due to concerns about inflation caused by Trump's tariffs, which have raised prices on various goods. However, recent data shows a significant slowdown in job growth, with only 22,000 jobs added in August and a revised loss of jobs in June. The unemployment rate remains relatively low at 4.3%, but this is partly due to immigration policies limiting the workforce. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has expressed concerns about rising downside risks to employment, warning that a sharp increase in layoffs and unemployment could occur quickly. On average, Fed officials project the unemployment rate to rise to 4.5% by the end of the year.
