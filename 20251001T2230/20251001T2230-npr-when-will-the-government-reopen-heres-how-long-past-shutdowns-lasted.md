## Article summary
The federal government has shut down for the first time since 2018 due to a standoff between Senate Republicans and Democrats over healthcare spending. Both parties are blaming each other, with more Americans holding Republicans responsible. The shutdown affects hundreds of thousands of federal employees and active-duty service members who will work without pay, and it may cause delays in services like Social Security benefits and passport applications. The longest shutdown in history lasted 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, costing the U.S. an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. Since 1976, there have been 20 funding gaps, with only a handful lasting more than two weeks. The 1995 shutdown, lasting 21 days, was due to disagreements between President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled House. The 2013 shutdown, lasting 16 days, was over the Affordable Care Act. A 2023 report found that the 2013 shutdown reduced GDP growth by $20 billion and cost the U.S. at least $2 billion in lost work hours. The appropriations process is complex, and funding gaps have become more common due to political divisions. The basis for government shutdowns was established in 1980 and 1981 by U.S. Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, who clarified the Antideficiency Act. Since then, there have been multiple shutdowns, with Civiletti expressing surprise at their frequency and political use.
