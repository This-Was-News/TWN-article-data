## Article summary
Hundreds of celebrities, led by Jane Fonda, have relaunched the Committee for the First Amendment to defend free speech and free expression. The group, which includes prominent figures like Spike Lee, John Legend, and Billie Eilish, aims to counter what they describe as a coordinated campaign by the federal government to silence critics. The original committee was formed during the McCarthy era to oppose the House Un-American Activities Committee, which targeted entertainers accused of being communists. The celebrities emphasize that defending free speech is not a partisan issue and urge solidarity in the face of repression. Jane Fonda, whose father was an early member, highlights the importance of standing together to protect constitutional rights.
