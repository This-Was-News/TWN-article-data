## Article summary
Activists on a flotilla heading to Gaza report that the Israeli navy has begun intercepting their vessels. The Global Sumud Flotilla, which includes notable figures like Greta Thunberg and Nelson Mandela's grandson, consists of nearly 50 boats carrying symbolic humanitarian aid. The flotilla aims to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. The Israeli navy has approached the flotilla, asking them to change course and warning them of an active combat zone. Italian and other European governments have urged the flotilla to turn back. Activists on board have reported intimidation tactics by Israeli warships, including jamming communications. Despite these challenges, the flotilla continues its journey, broadcasting live updates. The Israeli government has accused some flotilla members of links to Hamas, while activists deny these claims. The legality of Israel's blockade and the flotilla's actions remains a point of contention under international law. The flotilla argues that their mission is humanitarian and protected by international law.
