## Article summary
The Trump administration is leveraging the government shutdown to maximize political pain, halting funds for Democratic-led states and planning mass layoffs. White House budget director Russell T. Vought paused or canceled about $26 billion in approved funds, targeting programs like green energy initiatives and infrastructure projects in New York. The administration blamed Democrats for the shutdown and used it as an opportunity to cut federal agencies and programs. Federal employees are furloughed, and critical services are halted. Democratic leaders denounced the administration's actions, calling them a political game. The White House also suspended Voice of America broadcasts and laid the groundwork for more layoffs. Unions sued the administration, claiming it lacked authority for mass layoffs. The government is expected to employ 300,000 fewer workers by December. The shutdown's consequences are severe, with both parties acknowledging the financial harm to American families and businesses.
