## Article summary
An explosion at a New York City apartment building in the Bronx blew off a massive chimney, leaving a 20-story gash in the building's side. No injuries or deaths were reported, but the blast caused significant damage, including a plume of dust and a pile of bricks around the building and a nearby playground. Investigators are determining if a gas leak or another cause triggered the explosion. Residents reported hearing the blast just after 8 a.m. While apartments were not seriously damaged, some were evacuated as a precaution. The building is part of New York City's aging public housing system, which has faced chronic issues like mold, heat outages, and infrastructure needs. The city is investigating the cause and working to restore services and repair the building. A reception center was opened for impacted residents to receive resources.
