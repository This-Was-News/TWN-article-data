## Article summary
President Donald Trump signed an executive order pledging to defend Qatar with all measures, including military action, following Israel's strike on the country. The order, dated Monday but released Wednesday, aims to reassure Qatar amid its negotiations with Israel over a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The order cites the close cooperation and shared interests between the U.S. and Qatar, vowing to protect Qatar's security and territorial integrity. The U.S. will consider any attack on Qatar as a threat to its own peace and security, and will take appropriate measures, including military action if necessary. The order was signed during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington, where he expressed regret over the strike that killed six people, including a Qatari security member. The scope and legal weight of the pledge remain uncertain, as it is not a legally binding treaty. Qatar is a key U.S. military partner, hosting the Al Udeid Air Base, and was named a major non-NATO ally by President Joe Biden in 2022. The order comes amid regional tensions, with Saudi Arabia entering a mutual defense agreement with Pakistan. Experts suggest that the Gulf's importance to the U.S. warrants specific guarantees beyond Trump's assurances.
