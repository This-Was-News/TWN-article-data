## Article summary
Jane Goodall, a renowned British primatologist and conservationist, has passed away at the age of 91. Her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in the wild transformed perceptions of the relationship between humans and animals. Goodall's studies revealed that chimpanzees exhibit behaviors such as kissing, embracing, and showing love and compassion, as well as violence and warfare, highlighting their similarities to humans. Born in London in 1934, Goodall's early fascination with animals led her to pursue a career in primatology. She met paleontologist Louis Leakey, who hired her to study chimpanzees in what is now Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania. Despite initial challenges, Goodall's patience and respectful approach allowed her to gain the chimpanzees' trust. Her discovery that chimpanzees could make and use tools challenged scientific beliefs and redefined the understanding of tool use and intelligence. Goodall's work also highlighted the dark side of chimpanzee behavior, including brutal assaults and cannibalism. She became a global icon, appearing on the cover of National Geographic and in numerous documentaries. In 1977, she founded the Jane Goodall Institute to promote the protection of chimpanzees and the environment. Later, she became an activist, traveling extensively to raise awareness about the threats facing chimpanzees and the importance of conservation. Goodall's legacy includes her profound empathy for animals and her unwavering commitment to their protection.
