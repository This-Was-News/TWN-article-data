## Article summary
The first day of the federal government shutdown saw Republicans and Democrats blaming each other, with iconic sites like the Liberty Bell and Pearl Harbor closed. The Trump administration falsely claimed Democrats refused to fund the government to extend health coverage to illegal immigrants, while Democrats argued they wanted to renew Affordable Care Act subsidies to prevent insurance premium spikes. Neither side showed willingness to compromise, increasing the risk of economic pain and job losses. The White House used a controversial deepfake video of House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, which he described as bigoted, while Jeffries responded with a meme of his own. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of using the shutdown as blackmail. About 750,000 federal workers were expected to be furloughed, with some potentially fired. The White House targeted funding projects in Democratic states, withholding billions for New York's Hudson Rail Tunnel and green energy projects in 16 states. The last government shutdown in 2018-2019 lasted over 30 days and was largely blamed on Trump. Polls showed mixed blame for the current shutdown, with many voters blaming both sides equally. Essential services like federal courts and weather forecasting remained operational, but popular tourist sites were closed, frustrating visitors.
