## Article summary
The Supreme Court has allowed Lisa Cook to remain as a Federal Reserve governor for now, declining to act on the Trump administration's effort to immediately remove her. The court will hear arguments in January over Trump's attempt to force Cook off the Fed board, considering whether to block a lower-court ruling in her favor. Cook will participate in the remaining two Fed meetings in 2025, including the next interest rate-setting committee meeting in late October. The case is part of a broader legal fight over Trump's actions to fire members of independent federal agencies. The court's decision is seen as a rare instance of Trump not quickly getting everything he wants from the justices in an emergency appeal. Cook, appointed by President Joe Biden, has stated she will not leave her job and won't be bullied by Trump. The White House has accused Cook of mortgage fraud, but she has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. A district judge ruled that the administration had not satisfied the legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired for cause. The appeals court rejected the administration's request to let Cook's firing proceed. The Supreme Court's decision is seen as a demonstration of the distinction it makes between the Fed and other independent agencies, steering a course that favors Fed independence.
