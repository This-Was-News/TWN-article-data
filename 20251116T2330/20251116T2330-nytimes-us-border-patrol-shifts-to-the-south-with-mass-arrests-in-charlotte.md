## Article summary
U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted an operation in Charlotte, North Carolina, arresting 81 individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. This operation, dubbed "Charlottes Web," is reportedly the largest number of immigrant arrests in recent history for the state. The presence of agents, led by Gregory Bovino, disrupted local businesses and community events, with some establishments canceling operations and employees calling out of work due to fear and intimidation. Immigrant rights groups have criticized the operation's aggressive tactics, citing instances of individuals being approached or arrested during routine activities. Local officials, including Governor Josh Stein, have expressed concern and advised residents to record any inappropriate behavior by agents. The legality of the operation in Charlotte, which is over 100 miles from the nearest border or coastline, has been questioned. The Trump administration has defended such enforcement efforts, viewing anyone without legal status as a criminal. It remains unclear how long the operation will last, with agents expected to move to New Orleans next, and other cities like Asheville potentially facing similar operations.
