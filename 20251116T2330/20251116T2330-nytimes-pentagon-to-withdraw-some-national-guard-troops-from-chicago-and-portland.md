## Article summary
The Pentagon is withdrawing hundreds of National Guard soldiers from Chicago and Portland, Oregon, following President Trump's deployment orders, which faced significant opposition from state and local leaders. Approximately 200 California National Guard troops sent to Portland and 200 Texas National Guard members sent to Chicago will return home soon. These federalized Guard troops arrived in early October but were never deployed to assist federal law enforcement due to ongoing legal challenges. With holidays approaching and court orders halting operational deployment, Pentagon officials decided to withdraw the out-of-state soldiers to avoid prolonged, costly inactivity and separation from families. While some out-of-state troops are leaving, about 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain activated in Chicago, and around 100 Oregon National Guard soldiers will stay in Portland. The Northern Command indicated changes to the federalized troop mission were imminent, aiming for a "constant, enduring, and long-term presence." Federal judges had previously issued blocks on troop deployments in both Portland and Illinois in response to demonstrations and state sovereignty concerns. California officials applauded the decision to bring their troops home, condemning the initial deployment as illegal.
