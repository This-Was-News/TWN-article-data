## Article summary
U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents launched an operation named 'Charlotte's Web,' leading to the arrest of 81 individuals, many with criminal histories, across Charlotte, North Carolina. The operation, which targeted areas with large immigrant populations like Central Avenue and South Boulevard, began on Saturday and was met with protests from hundreds condemning the crackdown. Federal authorities stated the operation was initiated because local law enforcement was not detaining individuals charged with serious crimes, aiming to remove 'violent criminal illegal aliens' and ensure public safety. However, the arrests have instilled fear within the immigrant community, with business owners reporting that agents appeared to be targeting individuals of Latino appearance. Some business owners expressed concerns about the impact on their operations, with one owner stating the arrest of her lead mechanic would force her to close her shop temporarily. Local officials urged peaceful protest, acknowledging the fear and uncertainty the operation caused, while Republican leaders expressed confidence in federal law enforcement and criticized Democratic officials for prioritizing political theater over public safety. The scope and duration of the 'Charlotte's Web' operation remain unclear, with agents reportedly moving to New Orleans next.
