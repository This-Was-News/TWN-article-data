## Article summary
A New York Times investigation reveals that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has significantly shifted its focus from its core public safety missions to prioritize the arrest and deportation of undocumented immigrants, under pressure from President Trump. Thousands of federal agents have been reassigned from their regular duties, impacting critical investigations. For example, agents investigating child sexual abuse crimes have been temporarily diverted to immigration enforcement, hindering efforts to pursue child predators. A national security investigation into the black market for Iranian oil, intended to disrupt terrorist financing, has been stalled for months, allowing illicit activities to continue. Federal efforts to combat human smuggling and sex trafficking have also suffered as investigators are reassigned to assist with deportation operations. The impact extends to the Coast Guard, which has diverted aircraft for transporting immigrants, and the department's law enforcement academy, which has delayed training for various agencies to accommodate new immigration officers. This redirection of resources, based on internal documents and interviews with over 65 officials, suggests a compromise of the agency's broader mandate to ensure national security and public safety in favor of an intensified immigration crackdown.
