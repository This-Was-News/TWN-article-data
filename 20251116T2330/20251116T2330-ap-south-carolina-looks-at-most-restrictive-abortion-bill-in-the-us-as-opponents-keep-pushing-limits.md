## Article summary
South Carolina is considering the nation's most restrictive abortion bill, which proposes decades-long prison sentences for women and anyone assisting them, and would ban IUDs and potentially limit IVF. The bill, which eliminates exceptions for rape and incest, goes further than any other U.S. state's proposed legislation since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Doctors express concern that the bill would create a legal minefield, making it difficult to provide even basic healthcare advice. The proposal has divided anti-abortion groups, with some, like South Carolina Citizens for Life, opposing the punishment of women. Other groups, such as Equal Protection South Carolina, advocate for treating abortion as murder. Experts note that a faction of anti-abortion advocates, termed 'abolitionists,' are increasingly influential in pushing for more extreme measures. While a similar bill stalled last year, the political landscape in the South Carolina Senate has shifted, potentially giving the bill a clearer path. However, Senate leaders have not guaranteed that the bill will advance even if it passes the subcommittee. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Richard Cash, has acknowledged potential issues with banning contraception and restricting medical advice but has not detailed possible amendments.
