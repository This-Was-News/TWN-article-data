## Article summary
The world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, has entered the Caribbean Sea, signaling a potential escalation in U.S. military action against Venezuela. The carrier, carrying over 4,000 sailors and numerous aircraft, joins 15,000 other service members already in the region. Admiral Alvin Holsey of U.S. Southern Command stated the deployment reinforces the U.S. resolve to protect the Western Hemisphere. A U.S. military official indicated that preparations are being made for possible military action. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced "Operation Southern Spear" to combat narco-terrorists and secure the homeland from drug trafficking. While President Trump has suggested he has made a decision regarding military action, it remains unclear if he will proceed. The U.S. has conducted numerous strikes on boats suspected of drug trafficking from Venezuela, and has offered a $50 million reward for the arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. However, some officials believe the deployment of the USS Gerald Ford may be a pressure tactic. The increased military activity follows the resignation of Admiral Alvin Holsey, who reportedly objected to the strikes on alleged drug boats, some of which have resulted in fatalities and appeared non-hostile.
