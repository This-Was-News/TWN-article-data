## Article summary
The traditional image of gun ownership in America, characterized by white, rural, and Republican individuals, is evolving. An increasing number of liberals, people of color, and LGBTQ Americans are purchasing firearms, particularly following the 2024 election. Many cite fear and a desire for self-protection as primary motivations, influenced by the rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration. Organizations like the Liberal Gun Club have seen a significant surge in membership and training requests from these demographics. Individuals interviewed expressed concerns about potential civil unrest and the emboldening of right-wing extremists. While the White House dismisses these claims, blaming Democrats for inciting violence, anecdotal evidence and Google Trends data suggest a correlation between political events and increased gun purchases. Studies also indicate a rise in gun ownership among Democrats and minority groups in recent years. The new gun owners emphasize that their intent is solely for self-defense, not aggression. Despite the concerning reasons behind this trend, Second Amendment advocates acknowledge the right to self-defense.
