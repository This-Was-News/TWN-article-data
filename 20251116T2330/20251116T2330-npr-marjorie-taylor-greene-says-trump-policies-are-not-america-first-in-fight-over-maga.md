## Article summary
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly criticized President Trump's policies, stating they are "not America first" positions. This public rift follows Trump's withdrawal of his endorsement for Greene and his labeling her a "traitor." Greene expressed concern that Trump's words could "put my life in danger." She specifically took issue with Trump's defense of the H-1B visa program and his frequent international travel, arguing that Air Force One should "stay home." Greene also apologized for her past participation in "toxic politics." Despite the conflict with Trump, local GOP leadership in Georgia's 14th Congressional District have affirmed their support for Greene. The break between Greene and Trump appears to be linked to the ongoing debate over the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. Greene stated she does not believe Trump is implicated in these files. Meanwhile, Representative Thomas Massie warned Republicans that voting against the release of the Epstein documents could harm their political futures, regardless of Trump's immediate reactions.
