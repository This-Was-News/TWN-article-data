## Article summary
A top Border Patrol commander, Gregory Bovino, highlighted numerous arrests in Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of an immigration enforcement surge by the Trump administration. Despite claims of combating crime, local leaders and residents have voiced strong objections, particularly as crime rates in the city are reportedly declining. Bovino stated that over 80 arrests were made, focusing on individuals with alleged criminal records, including one with prior drunk driving convictions. This operation, dubbed "Operation Charlottes Web," has caused fear and uncertainty among residents, with reports of U.S. citizens being detained and a local nonprofit noting significant fear preventing people from attending essential appointments. Bovino's previous operations in Chicago and Los Angeles faced criticism and lawsuits over tactics, including the use of chemical agents and fatal shootings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claims the surge in Charlotte is a response to "sanctuary policies" that limit local cooperation with immigration agents, alleging that numerous detainers have gone unhonored, putting the public at risk. Federal agents have been observed near churches and apartment complexes, leading to concerns about the violation of people's right to worship and seek sanctuary. Protests against the federal enforcement have also occurred, resulting in arrests.
