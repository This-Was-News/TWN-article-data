## Article summary
New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to federal mortgage fraud charges in Virginia, accusing the Trump administration of using the justice system for political revenge. James is alleged to have misrepresented her use of a Norfolk home on mortgage documents to secure favorable loan terms, claiming it was a second residence when she rented it out. This case follows a civil fraud lawsuit James brought against former President Trump and his companies, in which she secured a significant judgment. James's court appearance is part of a pattern where Trump adversaries have faced federal charges after the president publicly called for their prosecution. Her legal team plans to argue that the prosecution is vindictive and initiated at the president's direction. The judge has set a trial date for January 26th. The indictment came after the federal prosecutor overseeing the investigation was reportedly pushed out and replaced by a former Trump lawyer. This situation has amplified concerns about the weaponization of the justice system. James expressed confidence in the rule of law and her belief in America, stating she felt no fear. Other Trump opponents, including former FBI Director James Comey and former national security adviser John Bolton, have also recently pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges.
