## Article summary
The U.S. State Department has issued a directive instructing staff to deny visas to individuals involved in fact-checking, content moderation, or other activities deemed 'censorship' by the Trump administration. This policy primarily targets H-1B visa applicants, commonly used by the tech industry. The memo states that any evidence of an applicant being responsible for or complicit in censorship of protected expression in the U.S. should lead to visa ineligibility. This directive stems from the administration's criticism of tech companies' content policies and the broader trust and safety field. President Trump's past experiences with social media bans are cited as a reason for this focus. Consular officers are instructed to scrutinize applicants' resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and media appearances for activities such as combating misinformation, fact-checking, and content moderation. Experts argue that trust and safety work is vital for protecting users and preventing harm, not censorship. A State Department spokesperson stated the administration defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreign censors. First Amendment experts have criticized the memo, calling the policy incoherent and unconstitutional, as it may infringe on free speech rights. This development follows the State Department's recent announcement requiring H-1B visa applicants to make their social media profiles public for review.
