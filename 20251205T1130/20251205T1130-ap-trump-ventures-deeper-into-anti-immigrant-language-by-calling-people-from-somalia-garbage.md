## Article summary
President Donald Trump has intensified his anti-immigrant rhetoric, recently referring to Somali immigrants in the U.S. as "garbage." This statement is part of a pattern of increasingly harsh language, including comparisons to Adolf Hitler's rhetoric and calling African nations "s-hole countries." Trump explicitly stated he does not want these immigrants in the country and urged them to "fix it" where they came from, receiving applause from his cabinet. Historians note that Trump has legitimized this type of language, bringing it into everyday conversation. His administration has pursued a broad agenda to limit immigration, including efforts to end birthright citizenship and drastically reduce refugee admissions. Studies suggest Trump uses more negative sentiment towards immigration than the average member of his own party. His remarks have drawn condemnation internationally and from figures like Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called his obsession "creepy and unhealthy." Trump's influence on immigration discourse is potent, pushing boundaries and impacting global conversations on the issue. While some countries have laws against hate speech, heads of state may have immunity, raising concerns about normalization of such language. Trump, however, remains unconcerned about political correctness, stating, "I don't care. I don't want them."
