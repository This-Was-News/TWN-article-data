## Article summary
A federal appeals court has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to halt grants for school mental health workers. These grants, established after the Uvalde, Texas school shooting, aim to increase the number of counselors, psychologists, and social workers in schools, particularly in rural and underserved areas. The Trump administration had opposed aspects of the grant programs related to race, deeming them harmful and limiting funding past December 2025. A U.S. District Judge previously ruled that the administration's move to cancel these grants was arbitrary and capricious. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the government's request for an emergency stay, stating they were unlikely to succeed on their claims of jurisdiction and irreparable injury. The grants were initially awarded under the Biden administration, with a focus on increasing the diversity of mental health professionals and serving communities directly. The Trump administration had argued that the grants promoted divisive ideologies based on race and sex. This preliminary ruling restores significant funding to some grantees in states that challenged the Education Department's decision, such as Madera County and Marin County in California.
