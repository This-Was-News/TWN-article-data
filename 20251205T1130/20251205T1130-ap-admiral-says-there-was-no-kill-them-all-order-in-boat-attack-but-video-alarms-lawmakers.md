## Article summary
Admiral Frank Mitch Bradley stated there was no "kill them all" order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth regarding a U.S. military strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean. However, a video of the attack showing the deaths of two survivors has raised serious concerns among lawmakers. While some Republicans, like Senator Tom Cotton, defended the operation, Democrats, including Representative Adam Smith, described the video as deeply troubling, showing two individuals in distress killed by U.S. forces. Smith questioned the administration's rationale, stating the order was to "destroy the drugs, kill the 11 people on the boat." Legal experts suggest such an action could violate the laws of military warfare. Congress is conducting an investigation into the campaign, which has resulted in over 80 deaths in approximately 20 strikes. Lawmakers are demanding the release of full video footage and written orders, which the Trump administration has largely denied. The administration's justification for these strikes is based on the argument that drug cartels pose a threat to American lives. Despite ongoing scrutiny, Hegseth has vowed the campaign will continue, leading some Democrats to call for his resignation. The U.S. Southern Command announced another strike in the eastern Pacific Ocean following a pause, resulting in four casualties.
