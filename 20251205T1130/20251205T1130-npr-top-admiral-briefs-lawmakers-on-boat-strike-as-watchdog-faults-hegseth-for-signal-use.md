## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for two separate incidents: a September boat strike in the Caribbean and his use of the Signal messaging app. Lawmakers were briefed on the boat strike, with some Democrats expressing shock and calling it a potential war crime, while a Republican senator defended it as lawful. The strike involved U.S. forces allegedly attacking survivors on a drug boat, with differing accounts of the events. Separately, a Pentagon watchdog report found that Hegseth violated policy by using Signal to discuss U.S. airstrikes in Yemen, potentially jeopardizing servicemembers and missions. The report concluded that sharing sensitive military plans on an unapproved, unsecure network risked compromising information. Hegseth, who declined to be interviewed for the investigation, stated the information shared did not require classification. The Pentagon spokesman, however, declared the report a "TOTAL exoneration" and stated the matter is resolved.
