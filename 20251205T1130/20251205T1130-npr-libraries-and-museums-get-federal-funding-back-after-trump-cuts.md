## Article summary
The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is reinstating all federal grants that were previously terminated by the Trump administration. This action supersedes any prior notices of grant termination received by institutions. The IMLS is the independent agency responsible for awarding federal grant funding to libraries and museums nationwide. Earlier this year, an executive order from President Trump led to the termination of these grants, which particularly impacted small and rural libraries with limited alternative funding sources. In response, attorneys general from 21 states filed a lawsuit, and a Rhode Island District Court judge ruled the administration's actions unlawful. Consequently, libraries and museums will regain access to funds that had been in limbo for months. The American Library Association hailed the reinstatement as a significant victory, emphasizing the ongoing need to advocate for continued and increased library resources. While federal funding typically constitutes a small portion of library budgets, it is crucial for supporting workforce training, pilot programs, and essential services like internet access in rural areas. In 2024, the IMLS awarded $266 million in grants to museums and libraries.
