## Article summary
A video shown to key lawmakers depicted the first strike on a boat in the Caribbean Sea on September 2, resulting in a fiery explosion that destroyed most of the vessel. After the smoke cleared, two survivors were seen clinging to the overturned hull, attempting to right it before climbing on top and slipping back into the water repeatedly. Admiral Frank M. Bradley then ordered a follow-up strike, after which the survivors disappeared from view. Military officials reportedly told lawmakers they believed the hull remained afloat due to remaining cocaine, speculating that the survivors might try to float back to Venezuela or be rescued by another boat to recover the drugs. However, the video did not show any communication devices, and a surveillance plane did not spot any nearby vessels. Despite prior information from U.S. officials suggesting one survivor had radioed for help, Admiral Bradley's remarks about communications were purely speculative, with the reason for this discrepancy unclear.
