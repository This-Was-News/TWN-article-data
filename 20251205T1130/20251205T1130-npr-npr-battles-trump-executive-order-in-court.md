## Article summary
NPR is in court arguing that President Trump's executive order to end federal subsidies for public media is illegal and violates the First Amendment. The administration claims the order is to stop funding biased media, a charge NPR denies. Theodore J. Boutrous, NPR's attorney, argued that the executive order, titled "Ending Taxpayer Subsidy of Biased Media," clearly shows the president's intent to discriminate based on viewpoint. The Justice Department, representing the Trump administration, did not dispute that the president acted due to perceived bias but argued NPR had not suffered true damage. Trump had previously succeeded in halting future federal funding to public media, leading to layoffs and programming cuts at some stations. Judge Randolph D. Moss expressed skepticism towards the government's arguments, noting that the National Endowment for the Arts canceled a grant for NPR to align with the decree. The case also involves a previous settlement where CPB agreed to pay NPR $35.9 million after NPR sued over a canceled contract, and CPB agreed not to enforce Trump's order. Judge Moss seemed to suggest a path for the government to avoid ruling the executive order illegal by formally agreeing to be bound by the CPB settlement. However, the Justice Department attorney was not prepared to accept this resolution, defending the president's power to cut funding based on content. A ruling from Judge Moss is expected soon.
