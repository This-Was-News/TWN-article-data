## Article summary
Despite receiving billions in aid from Western allies to support its war effort, Ukraine's government under President Volodymyr Zelensky has systematically undermined oversight mechanisms designed to prevent corruption. These mechanisms, primarily supervisory boards composed of independent experts, were intended to monitor spending, appoint executives, and curb graft in vital state-owned companies. However, the Zelensky administration has been found to stack these boards with loyalists, leave seats vacant, or delay their formation, effectively neutralizing their oversight function. This has allowed hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent without external scrutiny. A New York Times investigation revealed political interference not only at the nuclear power company Energoatom, where $100 million is allegedly siphoned off, but also at the electricity company Ukrenergo and the Defense Procurement Agency. While European leaders have privately criticized this corruption, they have largely tolerated it, prioritizing Ukraine's defense against Russia. Zelensky, who was elected on an anti-corruption platform, has also relaxed rules and worked with figures previously deemed corrupt in the name of wartime expediency. This ongoing corruption poses a significant risk to Ukraine's future, potentially jeopardizing crucial post-war reconstruction funds and its aspirations to join the European Union and NATO.
