## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in New Delhi to expand trade ties, aiming to reach $100 billion annually by 2030. This summit occurs amidst U.S. pressure on India to re-evaluate its long-standing partnership with Russia. The leaders agreed on an economic cooperation program until 2030 and emphasized strong energy ties, with Russia reaffirming its role as a reliable energy supplier to India. Discussions also included progress on a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union and India's plan to issue electronic visas for Russian tourists. While India seeks to balance its relationships with Moscow and Washington, this visit could impact trade negotiations with the EU and U.S., particularly given India's significant imports of Russian oil. The two nations also aim to finalize agreements on military cooperation, including faster delivery of S-400 missile systems and upgrades for fighter jets, alongside collaboration in areas like pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and labor mobility.
