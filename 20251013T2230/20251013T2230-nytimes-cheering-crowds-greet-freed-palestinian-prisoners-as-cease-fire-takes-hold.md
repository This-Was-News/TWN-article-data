## Article summary
Cheering crowds greeted Palestinian prisoners released by Israel under a new cease-fire deal. Families in Ramallah eagerly awaited the arrival of buses carrying nearly 2,000 released prisoners and detainees, many of whom looked exhausted. Nasser Shehadeh, released after three years, expressed his indescribable joy and exhaustion. The Israeli prison service confirmed the release of 1,968 Palestinians, including 250 convicted of terrorism offenses and 1,700 detained without charge. Some prisoners were sent into exile, and several required medical attention. Families expressed mixed emotions, with some overjoyed but alarmed by the health conditions of their released loved ones. The Israel Prison Service denied claims of mistreatment. The release of prisoners in exchange for hostages has historical precedents, with mixed reactions from Israelis. Some families in Ramallah left despondent after learning their relatives were not among those released. Most of the released prisoners were residents of Gaza, detained during the war, and were brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where large crowds gathered to welcome them.
