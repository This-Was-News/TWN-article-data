## Article summary
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has begun, with Israel withdrawing its forces and Palestinians returning to their devastated homes. Key figures related to the Gaza war include approximately 1,200 people killed in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and at least 67,869 Palestinians killed in Gaza since then. Among the Palestinian casualties, 20,179 were children. The conflict resulted in 251 hostages taken from Israel, with 20 living hostages released under the current ceasefire agreement and 28 deceased hostages to be released. Israel has freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The war has also caused at least 170,105 Palestinian injuries, with 2,615 killed while seeking food aid. Additionally, 468 Israeli soldiers, 565 aid workers, and 197 media workers in Gaza have been killed. The U.S. has spent $21.7 billion on military aid to Israel from October 2023 to September 2025. The conflict has damaged or destroyed 78% of structures in Gaza, affected 114 heritage sites, and left only 1.5% of cropland available for cultivation. Currently, 14 of 36 hospitals in Gaza are still functioning or partially functioning. This is the third ceasefire between Israel and Hamas since the conflict began on October 7, 2023.
