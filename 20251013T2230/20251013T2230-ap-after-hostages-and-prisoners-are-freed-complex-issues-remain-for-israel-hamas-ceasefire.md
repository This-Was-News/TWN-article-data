## Article summary
Israel and Hamas have taken a significant step in their ceasefire agreement by releasing hostages and prisoners, raising hopes for a permanent end to the two-year war in Gaza. However, complex issues such as Hamas's disarmament, governance of Gaza, and Palestinian statehood remain unresolved, highlighting the agreement's fragility. The release of the remaining living hostages brought joy to Israelis, but the urgency to end the war may diminish, easing pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Gaza faces severe destruction, with unclear plans for reconstruction. U.S. President Donald Trump visited the region to celebrate the deal and urged broader peace. Netanyahu committed to the agreement, stating it achieves all of Israel's objectives, while critics accused him of prolonging the war for political reasons. The war began with Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack, resulting in significant casualties on both sides. The conflict has spread across the Middle East, involving various groups. The fate of the hostages was a central driver for ending the war, with widespread support in Israel. The prisoners released include those serving life sentences and those seized during the war. The future governance of Gaza is uncertain, with Israel insisting on Hamas's disarmament and Hamas refusing. The U.S. plan envisions an international body governing Gaza, with eventual involvement from Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's authority. The plan also mentions a future Palestinian state, opposed by Netanyahu.
