## Article summary
President Donald Trump and Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi signed a peace deal to end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. As part of the agreement, Hamas released the last 20 living Israeli hostages, while Israel freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The ceasefire, which has been holding since Friday, is seen as a significant step towards peace in the region. Trump received a standing ovation in Israel's parliament and at the signing ceremony in Egypt for his role in brokering the deal. The hostages were reunited with their families, sparking celebrations across Israel. The agreement also includes the handover of the bodies of deceased hostages. However, many challenges remain, including the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas. The ceasefire calls for a group of Palestinian technocrats to temporarily govern Gaza, but their authority and identity are unclear. Despite these obstacles, the agreement is seen as a historic moment that could lead to a new era of peace in the Middle East.
