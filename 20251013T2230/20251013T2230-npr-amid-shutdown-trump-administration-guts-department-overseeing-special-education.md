## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced sweeping layoffs at the U.S. Department of Education, significantly impacting the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). The reduction-in-force (RIF) affects dozens of staff responsible for overseeing $15 billion in special education funding and ensuring states comply with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The layoffs, totaling 466 across the department, were part of broader cuts affecting 4,200 jobs. Employees fear the cuts will undermine the rights of 7.5 million children with disabilities, as OSERS staff are crucial for monitoring states and providing guidance to families. The federal law IDEA, which guarantees a free and appropriate public education for children with disabilities, relies on OSERS staff to review state plans and initiate investigations if necessary. Without these staff, there is concern that oversight will be lacking, and calls from parents seeking help will go unanswered. President Trump's plan to return education to the states has raised concerns about potential inconsistencies in how special education laws are interpreted and enforced across different states. The legality of the cuts to OSERS has also been questioned, as federal law requires the office to manage special education funding and programs. The layoffs have left employees and state officials worried about the future of special education oversight and support.
