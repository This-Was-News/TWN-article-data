## Article summary
Americans celebrated Indigenous Peoples Day with events honoring Native American culture and history, while also recognizing Columbus Day. President Biden acknowledged both days, but President Trump's proclamation focusing solely on Columbus drew criticism. Montana recognized Indigenous Peoples Day for the first time, with advocates emphasizing inclusivity and healing. Protests over historical narratives and racial injustices have led to a reevaluation of Columbus's legacy. Trump's proclamation criticized efforts to vilify Columbus, while Native American advocates called for a balanced view of history. The Wounded Knee Massacre medals controversy reignited calls for their rescission. Trump's Education Department redirected funds to tribal colleges, benefiting Native American education. The National Congress of American Indians praised the funding but noted challenges for non-TCU schools. Bipartisan support is crucial for addressing Native American issues and fulfilling federal obligations.
