## Article summary
North Carolina Republican legislative leaders plan to vote next week on redrawing the state's U.S. House district map, aiming to secure more GOP seats nationwide. This move follows President Donald Trump's call to resist Democratic redistricting efforts. The current map, created in 2023, resulted in Republicans winning 10 of the state's 14 House seats in 2024. The GOP may target the 1st District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis, to gain an 11th seat. House Speaker Destin Hal stated that the action is in response to Trump's mandate. Democrats criticize the move as an attempt to avoid accountability. The redistricting battle is part of a national trend, with states like Texas, California, and Missouri also adjusting their maps. North Carolina's plan is subject to pending litigation challenging current districts for racial discrimination. The outcome may depend on the litigation and the state's upcoming legislative session.
