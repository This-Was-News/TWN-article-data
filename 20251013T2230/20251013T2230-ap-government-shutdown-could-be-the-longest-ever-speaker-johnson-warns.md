## Article summary
Speaker Mike Johnson warns that the government shutdown could become the longest in history, with no negotiations until Democrats pause health care demands. The shutdown has led to mass layoffs, disrupted government operations, and caused flight delays. The House is not in session, while the Senate is stuck in a stalemate over health care subsidies. President Trump has ensured military personnel are paid, removing a key pressure point. The shutdown centers on Affordable Care Act subsidies, with Democrats demanding extensions and Republicans arguing it can be dealt with later. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries states no real negotiations are underway. The next potential deadline is November 1, when open enrollment begins and government workers on monthly pay schedules will go without paychecks. The health care debate has been ongoing since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010. Republicans are unlikely to repeal and replace Obamacare again, with 24 million now enrolled. The Trump administration is using various funding sources to pay military personnel and other priorities, while other departments face disruptions.
