## Article summary
The return of Israel's living hostages from Gaza marks a significant moment of national unity and redemption for Israelis after months of a polarizing war. The 20 living hostages, along with the remains of 28 deceased ones, were released as part of a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Many of the hostages had become well-known figures, their faces familiar from posters across the country. The release was met with joy and relief, as Israelis gathered to welcome them home. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump addressed the nation, emphasizing the need for healing and peace. The hostages were exchanged for nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The return of the hostages allows for a degree of closure, as there are no longer any living hostages left in Gaza. The deal, brokered by the Trump administration, signals the end of the war. The hostages returned in better condition than many had feared, and there were no humiliating handover ceremonies. The release process involved the Red Cross and Israeli forces, with the hostages being taken to hospitals for medical checks and reunions with family. The event was a moment of hope and healing for Israel, as the country looks forward to a time of peace.
