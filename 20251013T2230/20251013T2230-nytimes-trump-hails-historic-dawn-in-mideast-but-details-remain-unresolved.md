## Article summary
President Trump celebrated the end of the war in Gaza, marking a historic moment with a hostage-prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas. The swap, part of Trump's peace plan, saw 20 hostages released in exchange for 1,968 Palestinian prisoners. Trump's Middle East tour included a speech to the Israeli Parliament and a summit in Egypt, where world leaders praised his role in the cease-fire. However, the future of Gaza and the durability of the peace remain uncertain. The exchange was met with relief and hope among Israelis and Palestinians, though some Gazans expressed grief and despair. Trump's speech in Israel included political digressions and controversial remarks. The logistics of the deal involved Israeli forces withdrawing to a defensive line in Gaza. Hamas agreed to release the bodies of deceased hostages, but challenges in meeting the cease-fire's timeline were noted. Meanwhile, aid deliveries to Gaza showed progress, with some areas facing famine conditions.
