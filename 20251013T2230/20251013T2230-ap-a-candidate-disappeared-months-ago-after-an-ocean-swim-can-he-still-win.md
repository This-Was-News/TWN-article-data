## Article summary
A political candidate, Petros Krommidas, disappeared after a night swim in the Atlantic Ocean, leaving behind his belongings on Long Beach, Long Island. As Election Day approaches, voters face a unique choice: reelect the Republican incumbent or the missing Democrat. Local Democrats attempted to replace Krommidas, but a court ruled his name must remain on the ballot as he is legally considered missing, not deceased. Some Democrats, like James Hodge, urge voters to cast ballots for Krommidas to trigger a special election. Republicans argue that Democrats cannot claim Krommidas is dead, and a judge agreed, citing similar past cases. Krommidas' family, who declined to comment, shared posts honoring him and urging residents to vote for him. The situation has caused emotional strain for Krommidas' family and friends, who argue that politics should not overshadow human decency. Meanwhile, campaign signs for the Republican opponent are prominently displayed, and residents express mixed feelings about the unusual election scenario.
