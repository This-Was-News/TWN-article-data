## Article summary
The article discusses concerns about the increasing use of violent tactics by ICE officers, with numerous incidents captured on video. These include officers pinning individuals to the ground, drawing weapons, and using pepper balls against protesters and bystanders. Critics argue that these actions escalate tensions rather than de-escalate them. Recent incidents in Chicago, such as a massive apartment raid and the shooting of a woman, have raised further alarm. The ACLU of Illinois has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for violating protesters' constitutional rights. ICE officials maintain that their officers are highly trained and act within the law, but critics dispute this claim. Former officials and legal experts argue that federal immigration officers lack the training for urban policing and that their tactics are unnecessary and excessive. The article also highlights the importance of bystanders documenting these incidents to ensure accountability.
