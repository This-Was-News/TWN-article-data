## Article summary
The web page discusses a method to make white rice and pasta healthier by cooling them down. Nutritionist Mindy Patterson explains that white rice and pasta cause rapid blood sugar spikes, which can lead to inflammation, insulin resistance, and fatigue. However, cooling these foods for several hours or overnight transforms some of their carbohydrates into resistant starch, a type of fiber that is harder to digest. This process reduces blood sugar spikes and offers health benefits such as improved gut health and reduced inflammation. Microbiologist Maria Marco explains that cooling causes carbohydrates to tangle and form resistant starch. Gut microbiologist Ravinder Nagpal adds that resistant starch feeds beneficial gut microbes. The page advises reheating the food gently to preserve these benefits, as overcooking can destroy the resistant starch.
