## Article summary
Conservative activist Laura Loomer, an ally of President Trump, has announced she has obtained a press credential for the Pentagon. This development comes as many mainstream reporters have left the Pentagon press room due to a new policy they claim restricts their reporting. Loomer, known for her social media influence and for advocating for the dismissal of officials she deems disloyal to Trump, stated she is eager to cover the Pentagon and expose what she calls "deceptive and disloyal bad actors." She has previously criticized military officials and influenced personnel decisions within the Trump administration. While Trump has at times downplayed her influence, he previously fired National Security Council officials after Loomer presented him with evidence of their alleged disloyalty. Loomer has also been a controversial figure, facing criticism for promoting conspiracy theories and making inflammatory posts. The new Pentagon policy, which Loomer is now operating under, allows for access revocation if reporters seek unauthorized information. Loomer has invited tips for her investigations via a "Loomered Tip Line."
