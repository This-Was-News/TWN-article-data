## Article summary
Talks to end the government shutdown are intensifying as the federal closure nears becoming the longest in history, impacting millions of Americans. Senators from both parties are engaged in quiet negotiations to reopen the government, restore normal funding processes, and address expiring health insurance subsidies. The shutdown, now on day 35, has interrupted SNAP benefits and left hundreds of thousands of federal employees working without pay. Transportation officials warn of potential chaos in the skies if air traffic controllers miss another paycheck. President Trump has largely remained on the sidelines but threatened to halt food aid unless Democrats agree to reopen the government, a move Democrats argue defies court orders. Attention has shifted to the Senate, where a group of centrist dealmakers from both parties are working behind the scenes. Key goals include ensuring the normal government funding process resumes and guaranteeing votes on bipartisan agreements for certain government programs. A more difficult issue is resolving the standoff over funding for Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at year's end, leading to skyrocketing insurance premiums. While Republicans are reluctant to fund the program, a vote on a proposal is promised as part of any deal. The Senate has repeatedly failed to advance House-passed funding bills, and a new temporary measure is needed to keep the government running into the new year.
