## Article summary
Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander leading a Chicago immigration crackdown, has defended his agents' aggressive tactics, including the use of chemical agents and a helicopter raid, stating they are necessary due to threats faced by his agents. The operation, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," has resulted in over 3,200 arrests since September as part of the Trump administration's effort to target sanctuary cities. Bovino views his agents as "sanctuary busters," asserting that "there will be no sanctuaries." His presence in Chicago, away from the U.S.-Mexico border, has startled residents and drawn backlash from activists and local officials, including Governor JB Pritzker, who has called for investigations into the tactics. Despite criticism and lawsuits, Bovino maintains that his agents use the "least amount of force necessary" and claims some residents have thanked him. He defended a controversial raid on an apartment building, citing intelligence about threats, and denied that children were harmed, despite conflicting accounts. President Trump has endorsed the use of such tactics, while Pritzker's office accuses the federal government of diverting resources for "publicity stunts." Bovino indicated the Chicago operation would continue for an extended period, keeping future targets undisclosed.
