## Article summary
Dick Cheney, a formidable and divisive figure who served as Vice President under George W. Bush, has died at the age of 84. His tenure in office transformed the vice presidency into a significant hub of power and influence, far beyond its traditional role. Following the September 11th attacks, Cheney operated with a sense of urgency and conviction, becoming a key architect of the administration's response to terrorism, including the invasion of Iraq. He was known for his strategic mind and his willingness to exercise power assertively, often from behind the scenes. Cheney also served as Secretary of Defense under President George H.W. Bush, leading the Pentagon during the Persian Gulf War. Despite decades of heart disease, he remained a powerful force in policy decisions. In his later years, Cheney became a vocal critic of Donald Trump, even endorsing the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in 2024. He was also a supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, notably his daughter Mary Cheney. While some viewed him as a "Darth Vader" figure, others saw him as a steadfast public servant. His legacy is deeply intertwined with the post-9/11 era and the controversial decisions made during the Bush administration, particularly regarding the Iraq War.
