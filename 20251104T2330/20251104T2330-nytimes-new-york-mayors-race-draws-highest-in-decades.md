## Article summary
New York City is holding a closely watched mayoral election, with high voter turnout exceeding that of recent decades. The main contenders are Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and front-runner, former Governor Andrew M. Cuomo running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, aims to tax the wealthy to fund social programs and would be the city's first Muslim and South Asian mayor. His candidacy has faced criticism, particularly regarding his support for Palestinian rights, which opponents claim could endanger the Jewish community. Mamdani has denounced these criticisms as bigotry and Islamophobia, asserting his commitment to protecting all New Yorkers. Cuomo, a former three-term governor, was defeated by Mamdani in the Democratic primary and subsequently launched an independent bid. Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, is the Republican candidate. Former President Trump has endorsed Cuomo and threatened to withhold federal funds if Mamdani is elected. Voters are also deciding on housing proposals on the ballot. Polls remain open until 9 p.m. on election day.
