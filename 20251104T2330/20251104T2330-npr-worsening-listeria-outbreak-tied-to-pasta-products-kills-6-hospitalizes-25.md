## Article summary
A severe listeria outbreak linked to prepared pasta products has resulted in six deaths and 27 hospitalizations across 18 states. The outbreak, which began in June, initially prompted recalls of ready-to-eat chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals made by FreshRealm Inc. Further testing revealed the same listeria strain in pasta samples from Nate's Fine Foods, a supplier for FreshRealm and other companies. This led to expanded recalls of various pasta dishes sold at major grocery chains like Walmart, Kroger, and Trader Joe's. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal issues, with severe cases leading to confusion, stiff neck, and even death. Pregnant individuals, newborns, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable. The CDC and FDA are investigating the source and advising consumers to discard recalled products and clean contaminated surfaces. This outbreak follows other listeria incidents in the past year, including those linked to deli meats, baked goods, and frozen shakes.
