## Article summary
Two Massachusetts men, Logan David Patterson, 18, and Dominick Frank Cardoza, 20, have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive in connection with a weekend explosion at Harvard Medical School. The incident occurred early Saturday on the fourth floor of the Goldenson Building, which houses neurobiology labs and offices, but no one was injured. The explosion caused no structural damage to the building or its equipment. Authorities stated that the investigation is ongoing but there is no further threat to the university. Witnesses reported that Patterson and Cardoza were visiting Wentworth College for Halloween activities and were seen walking toward Harvard's medical school on the day of the blast. They allegedly entered the building through the roof, believing it to be abandoned. The charging document indicates they lit a roman candle outside and placed a cherry bomb inside a locker, which then exploded. The FBI and U.S. Attorney's office emphasized that this was not a harmless prank but a serious federal crime. The motive behind the incident remains unclear.
