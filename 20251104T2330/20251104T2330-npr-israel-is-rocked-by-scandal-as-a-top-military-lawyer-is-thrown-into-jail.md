## Article summary
A major scandal has erupted in Israel following the arrest of Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, the army's former top lawyer. Tomer-Yerushalmi is accused of fraud, breach of trust, and obstruction of justice in connection with the leak of a surveillance video. The video allegedly shows Israeli soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman military prison in July 2024. Tomer-Yerushalmi had approved the leak to highlight the seriousness of the abuse allegations, but this action drew sharp criticism from hard-line politicians. After resigning under pressure, she disappeared briefly, leaving a note for her family, which prompted a search and fears for her safety. She was found on a Tel Aviv beach and subsequently arrested. The incident has intensified political polarization in Israel, distracting from the core allegations of abuse. The case involves multiple legal issues: the alleged abuse of detainees, attempts to disrupt the investigation, and the circumstances surrounding the video leak. This saga highlights the deep divisions within Israeli society, even two years into a devastating war, and raises concerns about a return to the intense incitement seen before the October 7th attack.
