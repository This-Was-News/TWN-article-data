## Article summary
Japan has issued a megaquake advisory for its northern coast after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, near Hokkaido. While the recent quake caused only minor damage, officials are urging preparedness for a potentially larger, magnitude 8 or greater earthquake, which has an estimated 1% probability within the next week. This advisory is intended as a wake-up call, referencing the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The Japan Meteorological Agency explained that the recent quake temporarily increased seismic risks in the Hokkaido and Sanriku coast regions due to tectonic plate activity. Experts note the 2011 disaster originated from the Japan Trench, and a similar event today could trigger a tsunami up to 98 feet, potentially killing nearly 200,000 people and causing widespread destruction. Officials emphasize that the advisory is not a prediction but a call for caution, urging residents to prepare emergency kits, discuss evacuation plans, and secure their homes. This differs from a previous, more ambiguous advisory issued in 2024 for the Nankai Trough, which caused public panic and disruptions. The current advisory covers 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba Prefecture, with local governments actively inspecting relief supplies and disseminating information to residents.
