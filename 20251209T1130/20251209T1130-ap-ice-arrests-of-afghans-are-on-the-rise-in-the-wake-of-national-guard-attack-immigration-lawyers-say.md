## Article summary
Immigration lawyers report a surge in arrests of Afghan nationals in the U.S. following a National Guard shooting by an Afghan suspect. These arrests, primarily in Northern California, have impacted individuals who reported for check-ins with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), even those following legal procedures and seeking asylum. Many detained Afghans arrived in the U.S. within the last two years, some under Operation Allies Welcome. The White House stated that all Afghan nationals who entered during the Biden administration are being reexamined. While the Department of Homeland Security cited efforts to arrest criminals and suspected terrorists, advocates argue these actions amount to collective punishment. Some individuals detained had no criminal records, and their asylum interviews were reportedly canceled. The increased scrutiny has caused fear and anxiety within the Afghan community, with volunteers attempting to monitor ICE activities and support affected families.
