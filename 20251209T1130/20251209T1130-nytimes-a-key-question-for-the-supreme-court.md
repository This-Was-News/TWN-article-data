## Article summary
The Supreme Court is hearing a case regarding the President's power to fire officials in independent agencies, specifically concerning Rebecca Kelly Slaughter of the Federal Trade Commission. The Trump administration argued for a broad interpretation of presidential power, allowing removal without cause. However, the justices seemed concerned about the implications for the Federal Reserve's independence. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh questioned how the administration's argument could be applied to the Fed without jeopardizing its economic stability. The administration's lawyer struggled to provide a clear distinction between the FTC and the Fed. The outcome of this case could significantly impact the insulation of various agencies from political interference. A related case involving Fed Governor Lisa D. Cook is also pending.
