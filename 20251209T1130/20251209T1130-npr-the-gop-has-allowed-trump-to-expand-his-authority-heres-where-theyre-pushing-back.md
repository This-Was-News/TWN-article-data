## Article summary
Republicans in Congress have demonstrated a limited willingness to challenge President Trump, though some lawmakers are beginning to assert their independence. Recent actions, such as a Pentagon strike in the Caribbean and Trump's tariffs, have prompted criticism from a handful of Republican senators. Senators have also voiced concerns about healthcare subsidies and Trump's approach to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Additionally, some Republicans have opposed Trump's suggestions to abolish the filibuster, and one representative broke with the president over the release of Jeffrey Epstein investigation files. This pushback is seen by some as an acceleration of a trend, possibly influenced by Trump's declining approval ratings and the party's recent electoral performance. However, this is not the first time observers have predicted a shift in Congressional Republicans' stance towards Trump. Many of the Republicans currently vocalizing disagreements either are retiring, represent competitive districts, or are known centrists. While some argue that Congress has been ceding power to the executive branch for decades, Trump's presidency has escalated this trend. Experts note that while there are historical precedents for Congress reasserting its power, the current polarized political climate presents challenges to such institutional action.
