## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any land concessions to Russia, despite pressure from the U.S. for a compromise. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's laws and moral principles prohibit ceding territory, stating that his country is fighting to protect its land. He met with Pope Francis, reiterating his stance and seeking continued European support for Ukraine. The Vatican expressed a desire for a just and lasting peace through diplomatic initiatives. Zelenskyy also held discussions in London with leaders from the UK, France, and Germany to strengthen Ukraine's position amidst growing impatience from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly urged Ukraine to cede territory to end the conflict, a suggestion met with resistance from Ukraine and its European allies. Zelenskyy acknowledged Trump's desire to end the war but stressed the importance of understanding the situation from a Ukrainian perspective. European leaders are working to secure the peace process with robust security guarantees, as Russia continues its attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukraine has responded with its own drone attacks on Russian targets, including an LPG terminal.
