## Article summary
The Supreme Court is considering a case that could significantly expand presidential powers by potentially overturning a 90-year-old precedent. The case centers on President Trump's removal of Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic appointee to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The 1935 precedent, Humphrey's Executor, established that presidents cannot fire members of independent agencies like the FTC at will, requiring cause such as "inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office." During oral arguments, conservative justices appeared open to reconsidering this precedent, questioning its relevance to modern agencies like the FTC, which they noted wield more executive power today. Conversely, liberal justices expressed concern that overturning the precedent would undermine Congress's ability to create independent agencies and disrupt the balance of power within the government. The Trump administration argues that the Humphrey's Executor decision was flawed and that allowing at-will removal would increase accountability to the public. This case follows previous Supreme Court decisions that have chipped away at the Humphrey's Executor precedent, particularly in cases involving single-director agencies. The court is also set to hear another case involving the attempted firing of a Federal Reserve Governor, indicating a broader examination of presidential removal powers over independent agency officials.
