## Article summary
President Donald Trump stated that survivors of a U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean were attempting to right the vessel before a second missile was fired, claiming they were trying to prevent the drugs on board from being lost. This statement comes amidst calls from Democratic lawmakers to release footage of the Sept. 2 operation, which resulted in the deaths of eleven people. Trump initially suggested he was open to releasing the video but later deferred the decision to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, contradicting his earlier comments and attacking a reporter who questioned him. The U.S. administration has conducted numerous strikes on vessels targeting drug smugglers, with Trump justifying the campaign as necessary to combat drug flow into the U.S. Defense Secretary Hegseth indicated the video was under review but stressed the need for responsible release. Meanwhile, lawmakers are demanding the Pentagon provide unedited video footage, threatening to withhold travel funds from Hegseth's budget. While some lawmakers, like Senator Tom Cotton, do not oppose the footage's release, others, including Representatives Jim Himes and Adam Smith, found the video disturbing and questioned the legality of the second strike, suggesting the survivors were not in a position to continue fighting. Legal experts have noted that killing survivors at sea could violate the laws of military warfare.
