## Article summary
North Texas U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett has officially announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate in Texas, aiming to unseat Republican incumbent John Cornyn. Crockett, a two-term Congresswoman, framed her decision as a critical, "now or never" moment for the state, emphasizing her commitment to fighting for the middle class. She believes her outspoken criticism of former President Donald Trump and alignment with voters who have shown a recent lean away from "MAGA extremism" could benefit her campaign. Crockett characterized Cornyn as an establishment politician influenced by Trump, contrasting herself as a fighter for Texans facing issues like high grocery prices and housing costs. Cornyn's campaign, in turn, has sought to link Crockett to progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Before facing Cornyn in the general election, Crockett must first win the Democratic primary, potentially against state Rep. James Talarico, as former challenger Colin Allred has shifted his focus to a House seat. Cornyn also faces a primary challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton. Despite the historical difficulty for Democrats in winning statewide Texas contests, Crockett urged supporters to maintain faith. Her campaign priorities include addressing healthcare and affordability. Recent polling suggests Crockett holds an advantage over her Democratic primary opponents. If elected, Crockett would make history as the first Black woman to win a statewide office in Texas. She is vacating her House seat to pursue this Senate bid.
