## Article summary
The Supreme Court is considering a Republican-led effort to eliminate spending limits for political parties when they coordinate with candidates in federal elections. This case challenges a 2001 decision that upheld a long-standing provision of federal election law designed to prevent large donors from indirectly influencing candidates through unlimited party contributions. Democrats are urging the court to uphold the existing law. The Federal Election Commission and Republican committees argue that the court should reconsider these limits, aligning with recent decisions that have reduced restrictions on campaign finance. The Trump administration supported the Republican challenge. However, the court has appointed an independent lawyer to defend the law, who has suggested the case might be moot because the FEC now agrees with the Republicans that the law is unconstitutional. The lawsuit was initiated by Republican committees for House and Senate candidates. If the limits are removed, coordinated party spending for Senate races in 2025 could range from over $127,000 to nearly $4 million, while House race limits would be around $127,000 or $63,600 depending on the state.
