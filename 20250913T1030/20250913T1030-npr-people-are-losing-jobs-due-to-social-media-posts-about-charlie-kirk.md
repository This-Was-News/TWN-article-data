## Article summary
Over thirty people across the U.S. have lost their jobs, been placed on leave, or are under investigation due to social media posts criticizing or expressing schadenfreude about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of Turning Point USA. Conservatives are actively collecting and publicizing these posts, calling for the individuals to face consequences. Among those affected are public school teachers, military members, a sports reporter, and a city council official. MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd was one of the earliest and most prominent figures to face backlash for his live television comments about Kirk's shooting. Kirk's rhetoric was often incendiary, targeting various groups. The online campaign against those who criticized Kirk is more intense than in previous cases, partly due to a website called 'Expose Charlie's Murderers,' which lists individuals deemed to have celebrated Kirk's death. Some listed individuals have received death threats. Republican lawmakers and officials are signaling their readiness to punish people for their speech, with some calling for severe consequences, including job loss and revocation of visas for foreign nationals. Critics warn that this situation is being used to suppress free speech and further divide the country.
