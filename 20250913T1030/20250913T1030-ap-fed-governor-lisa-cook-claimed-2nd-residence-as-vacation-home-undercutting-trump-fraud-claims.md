## Article summary
Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook referred to a condominium she bought in June 2021 as a 'vacation home' on a loan estimate, which could undermine claims by the Trump administration that she committed mortgage fraud. President Donald Trump has sought to fire Cook, alleging she claimed both the condo and another property as primary residences simultaneously. Documents obtained by The Associated Press showed Cook described the property as a second home on a security clearance form. Cook sued the Trump administration to block her removal, securing an injunction allowing her to remain as a Fed governor. The administration has appealed the ruling and requested an emergency ruling before the Fed's meeting to decide on interest rates. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee, accused Cook of signing documents claiming both properties as primary residences, leading to a Justice Department investigation. Claiming a home as a primary residence can result in better mortgage terms. Fulton County tax records show Cook has never claimed a homestead exemption on the condo, which reduces property taxes for primary residences.
