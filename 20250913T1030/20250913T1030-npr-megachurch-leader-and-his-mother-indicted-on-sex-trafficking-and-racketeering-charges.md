## Article summary
Naasón Joaquín García, the leader of the La Luz del Mundo megachurch, and five other individuals, including his mother, have been indicted on federal charges of racketeering, child pornography, and sex trafficking. The charges carry penalties up to life in prison. García, who is already serving a 16-year sentence for state sex abuse charges, was moved to federal custody as the indictment was unsealed. Prosecutors allege that García and his family systematically abused followers over generations, with some victims as young as 13. The indictment also claims that the church leaders trafficked victims internationally and used them to smuggle money. Law enforcement officers found over $1 million in cash, gold bars, and other valuables in searches of the defendants' homes. García's defense attorney denies the charges, calling them part of a reckless campaign of government overreach. The case is ongoing, with prosecutors seeking the forfeiture of multiple properties owned by the church. The La Luz del Mundo church, based in Guadalajara, Mexico, has substantial operations in the U.S. and claims over 6 million followers worldwide.
