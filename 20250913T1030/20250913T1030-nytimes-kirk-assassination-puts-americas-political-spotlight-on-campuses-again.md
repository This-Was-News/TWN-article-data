## Article summary
The assassination of Charles Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought national attention to the role of colleges in America's political landscape. Kirk, known for his conservative work on campuses, founded Turning Point USA in 2012 to highlight what he perceived as rampant leftism in higher education. His influence coincided with a decline in public confidence in American universities. Colleges have historically been settings for cultural and political debates, from communism and racism to the Vietnam War and the Israel-Palestine conflict. Kirk's efforts, along with books like 'The Coddling of the American Mind,' contributed to a broader critique of liberal dominance on campuses. This critique gained traction beyond conservative circles, with moderate professors also denouncing liberal groupthink. The modern conservative movement, inspired by figures like William F. Buckley Jr., has long targeted perceived liberal biases in academia. Kirk's work amplified this sentiment, making colleges a focal point in America's political divisions.
