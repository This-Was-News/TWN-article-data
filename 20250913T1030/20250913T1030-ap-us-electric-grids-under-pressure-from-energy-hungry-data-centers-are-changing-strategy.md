## Article summary
U.S. electric grids are struggling to meet the growing demand from energy-intensive data centers, prompting policymakers to consider tough measures. Texas has already implemented a law to disconnect data centers during power emergencies to prevent blackouts, like the deadly one in 2021. This issue is spreading to other regions, including the mid-Atlantic grid, as data centers are being built faster than power plants can be constructed. Big Tech companies, which rely on a steady power supply, are pushing back against these measures. Analysts predict that similar strategies will emerge nationwide due to the increasing demand for AI products that require significant computing power. Grid operators project a spike in electricity demand in the coming years, largely driven by data centers. Proposals to manage this demand include mandating backup power supplies and offering financial incentives for voluntary shutdowns during emergencies. However, these measures have sparked controversy, with some arguing they could destabilize energy markets and deter investment. Consumer advocates suggest that data centers should build their own power sources to alleviate the strain on the grid. Google has taken a voluntary approach in Indiana, agreeing to reduce electricity use during peak demand periods. The debate continues over whether disconnecting data centers during emergencies is a viable long-term solution.
