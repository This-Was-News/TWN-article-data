## Article summary
A 22-year-old man, Tyler James Robinson, was arrested for the shooting of Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative figure. Robinson, who had no prior criminal history, was described by family members as having become more politically engaged and viewing Kirk as a spreader of hate. He was charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice. Robinson was held without bail. He was registered to vote but not affiliated with a political party and had not voted in recent elections. He lived with his parents in a suburb of St. George, Utah. Authorities believe Robinson acted alone, motivated by political views discussed during a family dinner. The case broke when a family member reported Robinson's confession to a friend. Social media posts revealed the family's active lifestyle, including target shooting and visits to military facilities. Robinson was a former honor roll student and currently a student in an electrical apprenticeship program.
