## Article summary
Parents should start talking to their children about AI as early as elementary school to ensure they understand the technology before encountering it through peers. Experts like Marc Watkins emphasize the importance of discussing ethical and responsible AI use. Many teens use AI tools like ChatGPT for homework and mental health support, often without adult guidance. While AI can bolster learning, there are significant risks, including unsafe responses to mental health queries. Experts recommend parents engage in weekly AI learning sessions, use tools like Google's Quick, Draw! to explain AI, and reinforce fact-checking. Parents should co-create AI rules with their kids, set limits, and prioritize real-life interactions. Conversations about AI can have a lasting impact on children, providing them with the guidance they need to navigate this evolving technology safely and responsibly.
