## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent attempt to assassinate Hamas leaders in Qatar appears to have backfired. The strike, which killed five low-level Hamas members and a Qatari security guard, failed to eliminate the intended senior leaders, who Hamas claims survived. This has damaged Netanyahu's global standing and strained relations with Qatar, a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas war, as well as with the White House. The attack has enraged Qatar and drawn criticism across the Arab world, potentially endangering the 20 hostages still believed to be alive in Gaza. Despite the setback, Netanyahu shows no signs of backing down, supported by his hard-line coalition. The strike has also thrown hopes of reaching a ceasefire into disarray. Netanyahu's goal of total victory over Hamas is increasingly unlikely, making it harder for him to push a ceasefire through his coalition. The attack has been criticized for abandoning negotiations and jeopardizing the release of remaining hostages. Qatar's Prime Minister has indicated that current talks are no longer valid, though he has not ruled out resuming mediation. Netanyahu's future depends on his governing coalition, which supports his hard-line approach, rather than public opinion, which largely favors an end to the war.
