## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, citing its strategic importance for Arctic security. Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark, is rich in rare earth minerals crucial for modern technology and is positioned to guard Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America. Its location above the Arctic Circle has made it vital for continental defense since World War II. The thawing Arctic ice due to climate change is opening new trade routes and intensifying competition for resources among nations like Russia and China. China's declaration as a "near-Arctic state" and its "Polar Silk Road" initiative have raised concerns for the U.S. regarding potential militarization. Russia is also increasing its military presence and restoring infrastructure in the Arctic. The U.S. operates the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, supporting missile warning and space surveillance for NATO. Denmark is enhancing its military capabilities in Greenland to assert sovereignty and monitor the region. Despite these geopolitical interests, Greenland's government and Denmark have rejected Trump's overtures, emphasizing the right of Greenlanders to decide their own future.
