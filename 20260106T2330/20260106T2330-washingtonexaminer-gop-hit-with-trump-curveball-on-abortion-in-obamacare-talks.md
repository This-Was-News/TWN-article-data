## Article summary
Former President Donald Trump has urged Republicans to be flexible on the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions, as a means to pass a healthcare deal. This directive came as Republicans and Democrats are in negotiations over enhanced Obamacare tax credits that expired. Senator James Lankford, an anti-abortion advocate, expressed strong opposition to any flexibility on the Hyde Amendment, stating that he does not believe some children are disposable. Senate Majority Leader John Thune acknowledged the difficulty in reaching an agreement due to the Hyde Amendment language. Democrats argue that existing safeguards prevent federal funding of abortions and that Republicans are attempting a backdoor ban. Anti-abortion groups have criticized Trump's suggestion, warning of electoral consequences if Republicans compromise on Hyde. However, Democrats view Trump's remarks as a potential opening to break the legislative deadlock. Negotiations are also complicated by Trump's insistence that individuals' health savings accounts be funded directly rather than subsidizing insurance companies. The House is expected to pass a three-year subsidy extension, but it faces an uphill battle in the Senate.
