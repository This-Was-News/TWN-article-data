## Article summary
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit has upheld a lower court's decision, permanently blocking the Trump administration from cutting funding for medical and public health research. This decision came after a lawsuit was filed by 22 attorneys general, including California's Rob Bonta, against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health. The Trump administration had announced a 15% indirect cost cut, which would have significantly impacted institutions like the University of California and California State University, which rely heavily on NIH grant funding. The court found the administration's action unlawful, violating a statute and regulations. Attorney General Rob Bonta expressed satisfaction with the ruling, calling it an important victory against the Trump Administration. The appellate court's decision confirms that the NIH-funded research is essential and that the attempted funding cuts were illegal. The lawsuit was joined by a coalition of attorneys general from various states across the U.S.
