## Article summary
On January 6, 2021, 140 police officers were injured defending the U.S. Capitol. Five years later, many still suffer from the physical and psychological effects of that day. NPR Investigations correspondent Tom Dreisbach reviewed body camera footage with two officers, Michael Fanone and Daniel Hodges, who defended the Capitol. Both officers experienced extreme violence in a tunnel, where they were outnumbered by rioters. These rioters were armed with various objects, including flagpoles, stun guns, crutches, stolen police shields, and chemical sprays. Fanone and Hodges, along with other officers, feel that Trump's mass pardon of January 6 rioters has worsened their trauma. Both officers have faced death threats and accusations of being "crisis actors." However, the body camera footage provides a stark visual record of their experiences. This footage is part of NPR's January 6 archive, a public database that documents arrests, charges, verdicts, and sentences related to the attack. The archive, expanded in December 2025, now includes police body-camera footage, surveillance video, and courtroom evidence, accessible for public examination on npr.org/j6archive.
