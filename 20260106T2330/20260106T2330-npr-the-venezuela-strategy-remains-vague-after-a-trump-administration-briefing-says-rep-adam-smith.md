## Article summary
Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, has described the Trump administration's long-term strategy for Venezuela as "vague." Following a briefing with administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, Smith stated that while lawmakers learned more about the operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro, the details about future plans were unclear. Smith expressed concern that the economic chaos in Venezuela could devolve into widespread gang violence, potentially exacerbating the very problems the intervention was intended to solve. He noted that the administration spoke of working with the interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, but provided no concrete specifics. Smith shared these insights during an interview with NPR's Leila Fadel, where he also discussed the legality of the operation and ongoing U.S. involvement in Venezuela.
