## Article summary
Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, was expected to appeal to white working-class voters but ultimately failed to do so. Despite his image as a "dads dad" and a "fixer of trucks," Walz was perceived by many voters as "weird" and underperformed in crucial Rust Belt states. His performance in the vice presidential debate was widely criticized, with some suggesting that former Vice President Kamala Harris regretted her choice of running mate. Harris reportedly would have preferred Pete Buttigieg but felt Walz was a less threatening option. Walz was intended to be a more moderate alternative to Donald Trump, similar to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, but failed to win over key demographics. He also expressed a dismissive view of "MAGA populists" during a podcast appearance with Gavin Newsom. Walz's political failure suggests that a combination of populism and cultural liberalism may not resonate with rural and working-class voters. Minnesota, a state that has historically leaned Democratic in presidential elections, saw Harris receive only 50.92% of the vote with Walz as her running mate. This performance preceded a day care fraud scandal that has potentially ended Walz's political career. The article suggests that while this may not impact midterm elections, Walz-style Democrats could face challenges in future presidential races.
