## Article summary
Despite possessing the world's largest untapped oil reserves, Venezuela's influence on global energy markets has significantly diminished due to political instability, economic challenges, and U.S. sanctions. However, a modest revival in its oil industry could have a substantial impact on global supply and potentially lower gasoline prices, particularly in the United States. Analysts suggest that if U.S. sanctions are eased, Venezuela's oil production could increase by up to 300,000 barrels per day in the near future. While reaching previous production levels of two million barrels per day is a distant prospect, even a moderate increase in output of extra-heavy crude could be significant. This type of oil requires specialized refining equipment, and U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast, already equipped to handle it, could benefit greatly. These refineries might be able to process Venezuelan crude at a significantly lower cost compared to other international buyers, potentially leading to price reductions at the pump for consumers. The market currently shows little concern about Venezuela's production, with analysts predicting an oversupply of oil in the early part of the year, which could drive prices down further. The long-term potential for Venezuela to become a major oil player again hinges on attracting investment and overcoming its domestic challenges.
