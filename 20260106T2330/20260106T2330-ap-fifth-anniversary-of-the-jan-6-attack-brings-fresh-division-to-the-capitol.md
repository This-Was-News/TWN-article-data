## Article summary
Five years after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, fresh divisions mark the anniversary, with no official event to memorialize the day due to political disagreements. Former President Donald Trump, speaking to House Republicans, shifted blame for the riot to the participants, stating he only intended for a peaceful protest. Democrats, meanwhile, held an unofficial hearing, with members of the Jan. 6 committee emphasizing the importance of remembering the events to prevent future occurrences. Enrique Tarrio, former leader of the Proud Boys, led a march to honor Ashli Babbitt and others who died, calling for the prosecution of officials involved in investigating the rioters. The White House released a report reframing the events and blaming Democrats for certifying the election. The anniversary also coincides with other major news, such as the capture of Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, and discussions of American expansionism. Democrats revived a committee to discuss the events, hearing testimony from a former Capitol Police officer and a rioter who apologized for her actions. Republicans, led by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, are forming a new committee to investigate security lapses and what they describe as a partisan investigation. The aftermath of Jan. 6 includes multiple deaths, indictments against Trump, and ongoing legal and political debates about presidential immunity and accountability.
