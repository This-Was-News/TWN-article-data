## Article summary
President Trump claims his voters are thrilled about the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and interviews with Trump supporters across the country reveal a mix of approval and caution. While many applaud the swift military operation and Maduro's capture, some express concern about potential U.S. entanglement in foreign conflicts, a departure from Trump's "America First" campaign promises. Supporters in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Indiana, and Michigan generally view the raid positively, seeing it as a decisive action against a dictator and a demonstration of Trump's strength. However, nuances emerge, with some voters like Chase Lewis in Mississippi questioning the cost and potential for war, and others like Patrick McCans in Colorado preferring diplomatic solutions. Despite the varied reactions, the operation has, for now, garnered significant support from Trump's base, with some seeing it as a successful display of American power. The long-term implications and potential for further intervention remain subjects of debate among these voters, highlighting a complex relationship between Trump's actions and his supporters' expectations.
