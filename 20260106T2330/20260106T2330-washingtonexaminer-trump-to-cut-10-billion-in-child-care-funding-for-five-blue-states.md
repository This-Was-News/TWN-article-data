## Article summary
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is cutting $10 billion in child care and social services funding for five Democrat-led states: California, New York, Illinois, Colorado, and Minnesota. This action is based on allegations of welfare fraud, with the Trump administration specifically cracking down on such fraud after a YouTube video exposed issues in Minnesota. The funding freeze affects the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program, the Child Care and Development Fund, and the Social Services Block Grant Program. An HHS spokesman stated that the administration is ensuring federal taxpayer dollars are used for legitimate purposes and that these states are following the law. Democratic officials, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul and California Governor Gavin Newsom, have criticized the cuts, calling them an attack on children and pledging to fight them. The HHS is reportedly concerned that the dispersed money may be benefiting noncitizens. Governor Newsom has invited the Trump administration to investigate fraud in California, stating a willingness to partner if they have information.
