## Article summary
The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold a hearing on Wednesday concerning the fraud and misuse of federal funds in Minnesota. Three Republican Minnesota state lawmakers who previously raised concerns about social services program fraud have been invited to testify. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and the state's attorney general have been invited to a second hearing on February 10th. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that taxpayers deserve accountability for stolen funds and that Congress has a duty to hold offenders accountable. Investigations have identified approximately $9 billion in government funds awarded to alleged fraudulent entities within Minnesota's taxpayer-funded social services programs. The $250 million Feeding Our Future pandemic relief scheme is one of the first major cases identified in what appears to be a broader pattern of high-dollar fraud. The scale of the fraud and reports of internal concerns being dismissed for political reasons reportedly contributed to Governor Walz's decision to withdraw from the 2026 gubernatorial race. The committee aims to understand the reasons behind the widespread fraud in Minnesota and explore potential preventative solutions. The Trump administration has halted federal child care funding to Minnesota due to exposed fraudulent child care centers.
