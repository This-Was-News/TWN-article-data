## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is tasked with the complex challenge of governing Venezuela following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. After pushing the Trump administration towards military action, Rubio now faces the difficult proposition of managing the impoverished country of 30 million people. This role is the riskiest of his career, potentially impacting his chances at higher office. The U.S. aims to gain access to Venezuela's vast oil reserves, a move that has drawn comparisons to colonial governance. The long shadow of past U.S. regime-change efforts looms, and a failure in Venezuela could ignite anti-American sentiment across Latin America. Rubio is navigating this delicate situation through the existing Venezuelan power structure, while also dealing with internal U.S. political pressures and the sidelined Venezuelan opposition leaders, María Corina Machado and Edmundo González. Despite past support for these opposition figures, Rubio's current strategy appears to prioritize U.S. national interests and stability over immediate democratic restoration. The U.S. is also preparing to potentially reopen its embassy in Caracas, signaling a new phase of engagement.
