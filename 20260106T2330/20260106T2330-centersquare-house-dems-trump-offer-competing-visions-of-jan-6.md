## Article summary
On the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol storming, House Democrats and the Trump administration presented starkly contrasting narratives. Democratic lawmakers, led by Rep. Bennie Thompson, questioned witnesses like former Capitol Police officer Winston Pingeon, who criticized President Trump's pardons for those involved in the attack. Rep. Jamie Raskin echoed these sentiments, calling the pardons indiscriminate and dangerous. Pam Hemphill, a Jan. 6 participant who declined a pardon, stated that accepting it would mean lying about the events. In response, the Trump administration launched a website detailing a timeline of Jan. 6 and defending the pardons, characterizing many participants as peaceful protestors wrongly labeled as insurrectionists by a "weaponized" DOJ. The administration also accused former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of misusing taxpayer funds to blame Trump and claimed Democrats staged a "real insurrection" by certifying a "fraud-ridden" election. Mary McCord, a witness for the House Democrats, emphasized that misinformation about the 2020 election results fueled the violence, warning against the suppression of voting rights and public protest through false narratives.
