## Article summary
European leaders have strongly pushed back against U.S. President Trump's comments suggesting a U.S. takeover of Greenland. Leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, along with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, have defended Greenland's sovereignty, stating it belongs to its people. Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark and a part of the NATO military alliance. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also voiced support for Greenland's autonomy. Despite these statements, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller reiterated the U.S. interest in Greenland for national security reasons, citing threats from China and Russia in the Arctic. Miller questioned Denmark's territorial claim over Greenland, which has been a Danish territory for centuries but gained self-government in 2009. Greenland's strategic location and rich mineral deposits, including rare earth minerals, oil, and natural gas, make it valuable. The dispute has caused anxiety, with Danish officials emphasizing that any U.S. military action against Greenland would be an attack on NATO. U.S. congressional representatives have also urged calm, stating that the U.S. already has access to what it needs from Greenland through existing agreements with Denmark.
