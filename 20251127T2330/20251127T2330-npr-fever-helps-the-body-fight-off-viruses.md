## Article summary
Fever, a response shared by many animal species, has long been debated for its role in fighting illness. Ancient physicians like Hippocrates believed fever could "cook out" an illness, while later thinkers saw it as a disease itself. Modern researchers understand fever as part of the immune response to pathogens, with accumulating evidence suggesting it aids in fighting infections, though the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Two main hypotheses exist: the heat directly harms the virus, or it enhances the immune system's function. A recent study in *Science*, using modified bird flu viruses and mice (which don't naturally develop fevers from flu), investigated the direct impact of heat. Researchers created a heat-tolerant version of a human flu virus by incorporating a gene from bird flu. When mice were infected, those housed at elevated temperatures showed better outcomes with the heat-tolerant strain compared to the normal strain, suggesting temperature alone can help combat certain viruses. While this study reinforces the idea that temperature is a significant factor in fighting infection, it doesn't rule out fever's role in boosting the immune system. Experts caution that findings in mice may not directly translate to humans, as high fevers can also be harmful. The research prompts questions about the automatic use of fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for viral infections, suggesting it might hinder the body's natural defense mechanisms.
