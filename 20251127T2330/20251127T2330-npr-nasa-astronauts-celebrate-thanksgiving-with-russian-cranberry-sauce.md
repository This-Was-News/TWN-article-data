## Article summary
NASA astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are celebrating Thanksgiving with a special meal featuring both traditional Thanksgiving fare and celebratory foods. This year's menu includes clams, oysters, crab meat, quail, smoked salmon, and even lobster, alongside turkey and mashed potatoes, all specially packaged for microgravity. Astronaut Mike Fincke expressed his enthusiasm for his second Thanksgiving in space, highlighting the unique experience. He also showcased a can of cranberry sauce provided by the Russian space agency, noting its significance as a favorite item. The astronauts will share this holiday meal with three Russian cosmonauts and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, fostering a sense of cultural respect and shared experience. Yui, while not celebrating Thanksgiving in Japan, expressed anticipation for the dinner on the ISS. The crew is also expecting potential new arrivals, as a Soyuz rocket carrying additional crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Williams, is scheduled to launch on Thanksgiving Day. The ground teams and NASA's food lab have taken great care to provide a festive and delicious meal for the astronauts, ensuring they can enjoy a taste of home while in orbit.
