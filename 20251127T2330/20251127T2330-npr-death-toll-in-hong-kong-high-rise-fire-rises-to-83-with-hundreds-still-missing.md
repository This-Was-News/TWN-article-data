## Article summary
A devastating fire erupted in the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong, resulting in a tragic death toll of at least 83 people, with hundreds still unaccounted for. The blaze, one of the region's deadliest in decades, also injured 76 individuals, including at least one firefighter. Authorities have arrested three men on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the incident. The Wang Fuk Court complex, home to approximately 4,600 residents, presented significant challenges for firefighters due to the height of the buildings and the limited reach of their equipment. The fire spread to a nearby secondary school, necessitating road closures and bus route diversions. Many residents, like an elderly couple who had lived there since its construction, were forced to evacuate and seek shelter with family, unsure of their homes' fate. The complex, built in 1983, was encased in bamboo scaffolding, a material Hong Kong's government had begun phasing out due to fire concerns. Comparisons have been drawn to the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London, with a survivors' group extending condolences to those affected in Hong Kong. The investigation into the cause of the fire is ongoing, and the death toll may rise as several injured individuals remain in critical condition.
