## Article summary
Refugee advocacy groups are expressing concern about potential backlash following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington D.C. by an Afghan national. Organizations like #AfghanEvac report that many Afghans living in the U.S. are now fearful of leaving their homes, worried about facing immigration scrutiny or hate speech. Shawn VanDiver of #AfghanEvac emphasized that the alleged perpetrator does not represent the entire Afghan community and that xenophobia is an inappropriate response. The suspect, identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had a history of working with a CIA-backed unit and had his asylum approved after a thorough vetting process. Following the incident, former President Trump announced a review of individuals who entered the U.S. from Afghanistan under the Biden administration. Refugee organizations fear that this incident will lead to guilt by association for entire communities. Ambassador Ashraf Haidari stressed the need for justice while cautioning against generalizations, stating that one individual's actions should not endanger entire communities. Matthew Soerens of World Relief echoed this sentiment, urging the country to hold the individual accountable without unfairly judging others who share similar characteristics. The incident has heightened anxieties among refugee communities who are seeking to rebuild their lives in America.
