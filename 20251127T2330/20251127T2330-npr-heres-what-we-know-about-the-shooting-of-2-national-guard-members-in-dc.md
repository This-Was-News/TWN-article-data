## Article summary
Two West Virginia National Guard members, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, are in critical condition after being shot in Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House. The alleged gunman, identified as Afghan national Rahmanuallah Lakanwal, drove from Washington state and used a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver in what authorities are calling a targeted attack and a direct challenge to law and order. Lakanwal, who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome due to his prior work with the CIA, is also hospitalized and faces terrorism charges, with prosecutors seeking life in prison or the death penalty. The shooting has prompted a coast-to-coast investigation, with inquiries extending overseas. In response, President Trump condemned the attack, reiterated anti-immigrant rhetoric, and ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops to D.C., adding to the over 2,000 already stationed there since August. This deployment has been controversial and faced legal challenges, with a recent federal judge ruling the D.C. troop use unlawful, though the injunction had not yet taken effect. U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services has also stopped processing immigration applications from Afghan nationals pending further review of security protocols. A motive for the shooting is not yet known.
