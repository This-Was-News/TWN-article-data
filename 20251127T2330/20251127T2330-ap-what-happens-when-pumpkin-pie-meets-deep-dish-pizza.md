## Article summary
This document presents a unique recipe that merges the comforting flavors of pumpkin pie with the hearty structure of a deep-dish pizza. The author, Stacey Mei Yan Fong, developed this recipe as part of her project "50 Pies, 50 States," aiming to capture the essence of each state through its pies. Illinois was chosen for pumpkin pie due to its significant role in pumpkin production and its designation as the official state pie. The resulting "deep-dish pumpkin pie" is described as an "engineering feat," inspired by Chicago's iconic skyscrapers. The recipe emphasizes the importance of a well-prepared crust, suggesting chilling the dough and using an egg wash for a golden-brown finish. Key to the pie's success is preparing the filling a day in advance to ensure a thicker custard. The instructions detail a multi-step process involving blind-baking the crust, filling it with the chilled pumpkin mixture, and baking until mostly set with a slight jiggle in the center. This innovative recipe offers a delightful twist on a classic dessert, encouraging bakers to think outside the box and enjoy a pie that requires a fork and knife, much like its deep-dish pizza inspiration.
