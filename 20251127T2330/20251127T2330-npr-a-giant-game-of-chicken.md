## Article summary
The U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean near Venezuela has fueled speculation of an armed intervention against President Nicolás Maduro's government. While many Venezuelans, including opposition leader María Corina Machado, support U.S. action, it faces significant risks and domestic opposition in the U.S. President Trump has long sought to depose Maduro, and recent actions, including designating Venezuela's government a terrorist organization, suggest a willingness to consider military options. However, a full-scale invasion is deemed impractical due to Venezuela's size and rugged terrain, and even a smaller force would likely face significant armed resistance from pro-Maduro militias and Colombian guerrillas. Despite widespread disdain for Maduro, a CBS News poll indicates 70% of Americans oppose military action in Venezuela. Experts suggest Trump may be hoping the pressure will provoke a palace coup, but Maduro has consolidated power with loyalists and Cuban bodyguards. The long-term consequences of an overthrow are uncertain, with questions about U.S. willingness to fund reconstruction efforts. The official anti-narcotics mission, "Operation Southern Spear," is seen by some as a pretext for the significant military deployment. Ultimately, the standoff is described as a "giant game of chicken," where Maduro may benefit from time if he can withstand the pressure.
