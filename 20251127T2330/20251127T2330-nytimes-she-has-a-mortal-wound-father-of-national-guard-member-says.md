## Article summary
Two members of the West Virginia National Guard, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, and U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, are in critical condition after being ambushed near the White House. Both had been deployed to Washington D.C. in August as part of a crime crackdown. Sergeant Wolfe's family is requesting prayers, while Specialist Beckstrom's father stated she sustained a mortal wound and is unlikely to recover. Specialist Beckstrom was described as caring and tenderhearted, aspiring to a career in the F.B.I. She initially disliked the Guard's presence in D.C. but grew to enjoy the city. Sergeant Wolfe was described as strong, determined, and God-fearing by a friend who had no doubt of his willpower to survive. The incident has left the families of the two Guard troops in anguish as they await news of their loved ones.
