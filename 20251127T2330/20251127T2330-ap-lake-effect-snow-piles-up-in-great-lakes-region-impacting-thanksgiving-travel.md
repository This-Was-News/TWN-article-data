## Article summary
A significant winter storm is impacting the Great Lakes region, bringing heavy lake effect snow and disrupting Thanksgiving travel. Several areas, particularly in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, have already received over a foot of snow, with some locations reporting up to 33 inches. The phenomenon of lake effect snow occurs when cold Canadian air blows over the warmer Great Lakes, creating narrow bands of intense snowfall that can dump several inches per hour. This has led to hazardous driving conditions, including sudden whiteouts and low visibility, especially on Thanksgiving Day. Strong winds accompanying the snow have also caused significant snow drifts and power outages in parts of Michigan. The National Weather Service has issued blizzard warnings for some areas and warns of slick roads. While the lake effect snow is expected to taper off by Friday, another storm system is forecast to bring snow to the Plains and Midwest over the weekend, with Chicago potentially receiving up to six inches.
