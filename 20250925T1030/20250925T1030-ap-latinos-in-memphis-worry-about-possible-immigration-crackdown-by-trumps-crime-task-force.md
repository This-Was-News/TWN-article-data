## Article summary
Latinos in Memphis are concerned about a potential immigration crackdown following President Donald Trump's creation of a task force to combat crime in the city. The Memphis Safe Task Force includes the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), leading to fears of increased detentions and deportations. Sandra Pita, a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, expresses worries about her children and other Latinos being targeted due to their skin color. Opponents of the deployment view it as an unnecessary federal occupation, while supporters see it as a needed boost in law enforcement. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee has not yet officially ordered the deployment of National Guard members, but the involvement of federal agencies remains a concern. Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, opposes the deployment, advocating instead for addressing poverty and homelessness. Data from a similar operation in Washington showed that over 40% of arrests were immigration-related. Community groups in Memphis are educating Latinos about their rights and providing guidance on dealing with immigration agents. Mauricio Calvo, CEO of Latino Memphis, warns about the potential for racial profiling and deportations. Casey Bryant, a lawyer, highlights the risks of confusion and deprivation of due process rights due to unfamiliarity with immigration law among law enforcement. The community is preparing for possible run-ins with law enforcement and the implications of the deployment.
