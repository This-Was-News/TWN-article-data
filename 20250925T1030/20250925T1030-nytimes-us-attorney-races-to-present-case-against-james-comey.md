## Article summary
President Trump's appointed prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, is rushing to present a case against former F.B.I. director James B. Comey to a grand jury before a deadline early next week. Halligan, a former defense lawyer for Trump with no prior prosecutorial experience, is under pressure from the White House to draft an indictment, despite career prosecutors previously determining there was insufficient evidence to charge Comey. The investigation focuses on whether Comey lied to Congress regarding the F.B.I.'s investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign ties to Russia. Halligan aims to bring charges by Tuesday, when the statute of limitations on Comey's congressional testimony expires. However, it is uncertain if a career prosecutor will present the case or if Halligan will appear in court. Proving perjury is challenging, requiring evidence that a statement was false and the defendant knew it was false at the time of testimony. Career prosecutors had earlier concluded there was insufficient evidence to convict Comey. Trump has intensified his demands for the Justice Department to prosecute Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The case's location and the grand jury's decision remain uncertain.
