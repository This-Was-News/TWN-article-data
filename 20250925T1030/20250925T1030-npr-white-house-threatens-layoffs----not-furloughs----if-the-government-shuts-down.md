## Article summary
The White House has threatened to permanently lay off federal workers rather than furlough them if the government shuts down on October 1. This approach, outlined in a memo obtained by NPR, marks a significant shift from past shutdowns where employees were temporarily sent home. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructed agency heads to use the funding lapse to issue 'reduction in force' (RIF) notices to workers in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. This move is part of a broader effort by President Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, to cut government programs funded by Congress. Meanwhile, House Republicans have passed a bill to fund the government through November 21, but Senate Democrats are pushing for additional measures, including subsidies for Affordable Care Act insurance premiums. Trump canceled a meeting with Democratic leaders, accusing them of making 'unserious and ridiculous demands.' The OMB suggested that layoff notices could be avoided if Democrats support the House bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the memo as an 'attempt at intimidation,' arguing that the firings would likely be overturned or reversed. Congressional Democrats face pressure from voters to resist Trump after supporting a six-month spending bill in March. This plan contrasts with the Trump administration's approach during his first term, when efforts were made to minimize the impact of a 35-day shutdown.
