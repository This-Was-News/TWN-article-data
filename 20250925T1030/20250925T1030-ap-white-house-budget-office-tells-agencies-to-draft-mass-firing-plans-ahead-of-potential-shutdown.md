## Article summary
The White House has instructed federal agencies to prepare for large-scale firings of workers in the event of a government shutdown next week. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo suggesting a reduction in force for programs whose funding would lapse, which is a more aggressive step than previous shutdowns where workers were furloughed but later reinstated. This move would eliminate positions, adding to the significant cuts the federal workforce has already faced this year. Agencies are asked to revise their plans post-shutdown to retain only essential employees. The memo escalates pressure on Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who have opposed a clean funding bill without health care improvements. Both Democrats criticized the memo, calling it an attempt at intimidation. The OMB has been coordinating with agencies for shutdown planning, though it has not posted contingency plans online. The memo also highlights Democratic demands for health insurance subsidies and Medicaid cuts reversal, which are blocking the funding bill. The OMB emphasizes the importance of preparedness for a potential shutdown and notes that many agencies have submitted their plans.
