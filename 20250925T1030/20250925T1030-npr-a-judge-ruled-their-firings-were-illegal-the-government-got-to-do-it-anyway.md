## Article summary
Jessie Beck, a fisheries biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was among the probationary employees fired by the Trump administration. U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled these firings were unlawful but did not require reinstatement, citing Supreme Court decisions and the passage of time. Beck disputes the claim that terminated employees have moved on, asserting she and others would return to their jobs. The Supreme Court's shadow docket has expanded presidential powers over executive branch hirings and firings, limiting judicial intervention. Beck, now struggling financially, had been working on conservation solutions in Alaska. Another former employee, a health care technology expert, also faces job search difficulties and unemployment insurance issues. Alsup criticized the government for withholding documents and misleading the court. He ordered agencies to issue letters clarifying that terminations were not performance-related, though the government added disclaimers. Beck hopes the revised letters will clear her record, but the government has appealed the decision. The firings have had lasting impacts on the careers and lives of those affected.
