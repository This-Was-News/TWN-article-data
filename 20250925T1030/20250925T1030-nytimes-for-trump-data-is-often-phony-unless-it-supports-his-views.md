## Article summary
President Trump's approach to data is highly selective, praising figures that align with his narrative while dismissing those that do not. He has escalated attacks on independent data sources, including firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and misrepresenting evidence on various issues. Trump has repeatedly dismissed favorable jobs data under President Biden as phony, only to celebrate the same data once he returned to office. He has also fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing the agency of providing fraudulent numbers. Regarding crime, Trump has claimed record-high crime rates to justify federal interventions, despite data showing declines in violent crime. He has also accused local officials of manipulating crime data, though experts maintain the official reports are reliable. Additionally, Trump has cited and attacked the Congressional Budget Office depending on whether its analyses support his policies. He has praised the office's projections when they align with his agenda but denounced it when its reports undercut his legislative policies.
