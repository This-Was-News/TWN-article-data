## Article summary
President Trump has shown decreasing interest in mediating a peace accord, providing security guarantees, or aiding Ukraine. Eight months into his second term, he asserted that Ukraine could force Russia to retreat with courage, ingenuity, and NATO weapons. However, his stance suggests a desire to disengage from the Ukraine conflict, having failed to bring Putin to negotiations. Trump's foreign policy is often driven by personal feelings rather than strategic analysis, and his advisers were surprised by his sudden belief in Ukraine's ability to win back occupied territory. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated that the war cannot end militarily and will require negotiations. White House officials did not respond to questions about Trump's new strategy, but a senior official criticized the Biden administration's approach and mentioned Trump's willingness to impose tariffs on Moscow if Europe stops buying Russian energy.
