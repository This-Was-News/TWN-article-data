## Article summary
Meta is constructing a $10 billion data center in rural Louisiana, which will require over $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure. The project has raised concerns about who will bear the costs, as Meta's payments and the economic impact remain unclear due to nondisclosure agreements. Consumer advocates and regulators have expressed worries about potential rate increases and the long-term financial burden on the public. While Meta has agreed to fund half the cost of the power plants, questions remain about job creation, economic benefits, and the environmental impact. Some residents hope for economic growth, while others fear displacement and infrastructure strain. Louisiana has exempted Meta from sales tax, potentially costing the state millions annually. Other states have implemented measures to protect ratepayers from data center-related costs, contrasting with Louisiana's approach. The project highlights the broader debate over the responsibilities of tech companies in infrastructure development and cost-sharing.
