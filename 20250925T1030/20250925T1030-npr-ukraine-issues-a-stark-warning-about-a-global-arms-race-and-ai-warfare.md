## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the 80th session of the U.N. General Assembly, warning of a dangerous AI-driven arms race and war. He highlighted the potential for autonomous drones to fight and target infrastructure without human intervention, calling for global regulations on AI in weapons. Zelenskyy also warned that drones could eventually deliver nuclear warheads. His speech came amid heightened tensions in Europe due to recent Russian drone incursions into NATO's eastern member states, raising fears of a regional spillover from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine is not the only target, as Russian operations are spreading across countries. The day before, President Trump met with Zelenskyy and expressed new optimism about Ukraine's prospects against Russia, suggesting that Ukraine could win back all its territory with EU support. This shift contrasts with Trump's previous stance, where he and his administration insisted that Ukraine might need to cede territory to Russia, including Crimea. Trump also stated that NATO members should shoot down Russian aircraft violating their airspace.
