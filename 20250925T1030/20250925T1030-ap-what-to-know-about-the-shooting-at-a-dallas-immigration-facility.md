## Article summary
A gunman fired upon a Dallas immigration field office from a nearby roof on Wednesday morning, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others before taking his own life. The attack was described as an indiscriminate assault on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). All three victims were in a van outside the facility at the time. Authorities found ammunition with anti-ICE messaging at the scene. The attack follows recent targeted killings in the U.S., including the shooting of conservative leader Charlie Kirk two weeks prior. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered increased security at ICE facilities nationwide. The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, used a bolt-action rifle. Jahn had a criminal record and briefly worked in the marijuana industry. The FBI is investigating the motive behind the attack. The shooting occurred at a local field office where agents conduct short-term processing of detainees. This is the third shooting in Texas directed at ICE or CBP, sparking political debate over rhetoric targeting immigration enforcement agencies.
