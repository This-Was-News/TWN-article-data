## Article summary
Hundreds of climate protesters marched in Belem, Brazil, during the COP30 UN climate talks, using costumes and drums to demand their voices be heard. Demonstrators, many wearing red shirts to symbolize the fight for the environment, walked a 4-kilometer route near the main venue. Organizers aimed to pressure world leaders into making more humanized decisions regarding climate change. The protest, considered the largest climate march for some participants, included diverse groups like indigenous women and rural workers advocating for their specific environmental and cultural concerns. Many expressed relief at being able to demonstrate more openly compared to previous talks in more authoritarian nations. Protesters also voiced criticism towards countries like the United States, which is skipping the talks. While major new agreements are not expected, participants hope for progress on existing promises, particularly financial aid for developing nations to adapt to climate change. The march highlighted the growing popular participation in the climate movement. The COP30 talks are scheduled to continue through Friday.
