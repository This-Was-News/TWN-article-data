## Article summary
In the recent elections in Virginia and New Jersey, voters sent a clear message that the economy under President Donald Trump is now a significant concern. Democrats like Nicole Cole in Virginia successfully ousted long-term Republican incumbents by campaigning on issues like the high cost of groceries, including eggs, beef, and coffee. This economic anxiety appeared to resonate with voters, suggesting a shift in perception of whose economy is currently impacting their lives. While some prices have stabilized, the overall cost of living remains a key factor influencing electoral outcomes. The swings were particularly notable in suburban and exurban areas, which are often decisive in midterm elections. Candidates from both parties acknowledged that voters are closely watching the effects of the current administration's policies on their local communities. Concerns about healthcare costs, education, and utility bills were frequently raised by Democratic candidates. Some Republicans conceded that their party's message may have been overshadowed by national political discourse. The affordability of everyday goods and services emerged as a simple yet powerful theme driving voter decisions in these key states.
