## Article summary
U.S. Border Patrol has launched an operation in Charlotte, North Carolina, expanding the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants to another Democrat-led city. The operation, dubbed "Charlottes Web," began on Saturday, with federal agents seen fanning out across immigrant enclaves and making arrests. Charlotte, the state's largest city with a growing immigrant population, had been anticipating the arrival of Border Patrol agents, including senior official Gregory Bovino, who led similar controversial operations in Chicago and Los Angeles. By Saturday afternoon, immigrant hubs in Charlotte were largely deserted as news of the agents' presence spread, leading to the closure of businesses and the absence of street vendors. Residents shared videos of masked Border Patrol agents arriving at small businesses and Home Depots, searching for individuals. While the number of detentions was not immediately clear, the operation's reach appeared to be expanding. Agents were observed at a Home Depot, with one agent stating they were searching for criminals. The duration of the operation in Charlotte remains uncertain.
