## Article summary
An increasing number of liberals, people of color, and LGBTQ Americans are purchasing firearms due to fear, a trend that has surged particularly since the 2024 election. Individuals like Charles, a Black doctor, have begun training weekly with handguns, citing concerns over the Trump administration's actions and rhetoric, fearing potential civil unrest or targeted violence. Gun clubs such as the Liberal Gun Club have reported significant membership growth and a quintupling of training requests. Spokespeople for these groups suggest that supporters of the right-wing feel emboldened to act violently against those they dislike. While the White House has dismissed these concerns, blaming Democrats for inciting violence, many liberals argue that the President's dehumanizing language fuels fear. Gun sales have seen spikes correlating with significant political events, and studies indicate a rise in gun ownership among Democrats. The pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot are also cited as drivers for new gun owners, who are disproportionately African American and female. These new gun owners emphasize that their purchases are strictly for self-protection, not aggression. Organizations like the Second Amendment Foundation acknowledge the rise in liberal gun ownership but express concern over the underlying fear driving it.
