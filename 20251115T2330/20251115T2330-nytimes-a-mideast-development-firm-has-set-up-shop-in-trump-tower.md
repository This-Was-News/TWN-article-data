## Article summary
Dar Global has emerged as the Trump Organization's most significant foreign business partner, facilitating deals with Gulf Arab governments and companies. The Saudi real-estate developer's licensing of the Trump name generated $21.9 million for the Trump family business last year. Dar Global, an offshoot of a major Saudi developer with government ties, has leveraged the Trump brand for global expansion, even opening a U.S. office in Trump Tower. The partnership's origins trace back over a decade to Dubai, where CEO Ziad El Chaar initiated a Trump golf course project. Despite other Middle East ventures faltering, the Dubai golf course became the first Trump-branded property in the region. After Donald Trump left office, Dar Global entered its first deal with the Trump Organization in 2022, licensing the name for a project in Oman. The company has since announced numerous Trump-branded projects across Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. El Chaar aims to position these ventures as separate from political concerns, emphasizing a focus on the business organization. The collaboration has been mutually celebrated, with Eric Trump calling Dar Global "the greatest partners in the world."
