## Article summary
A public feud has erupted between former President Donald Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, potentially creating a rift within the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Greene has publicly criticized Trump's foreign policy focus and his reluctance to release documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. In response, Trump has publicly supported a primary challenge against Greene, calling her "Wacky Marjorie" and suggesting she "has lost her way." This split is significant as Greene has been one of Trump's most ardent supporters since 2020, with Trump previously calling her a "future Republican Star." Despite Trump's efforts to quell dissent, Greene is not backing down and has suggested she is the true champion of the "America First" agenda. The feud highlights a common dynamic in politics where coalitions can fray, especially as a president enters their second term. Trump faces a critical test in the upcoming midterms as Democrats aim to regain control of the House. He is also attempting to remove lawmakers he deems disloyal, with Greene potentially being the next target if the rift is not mended. Greene has recently adopted a more conciliatory tone in public appearances, sparking speculation about her future political ambitions. However, her criticism of Trump's foreign policy and her involvement in efforts to release Epstein documents have exacerbated their public falling out.
