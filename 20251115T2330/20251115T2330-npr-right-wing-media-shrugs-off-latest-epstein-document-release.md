## Article summary
Newly released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein have been met with downplaying and skepticism from some right-wing media figures and influencers. Despite the thousands of pages containing names of prominent individuals, including President Donald Trump, some in the right-wing media dismiss the information as "nothingburgers" or question its authenticity. Some argue that the documents suggest Trump was informing on Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, while others claim they prove Trump did nothing wrong. A common narrative on the right is that Democrats are using the Epstein documents as a distraction from their own failures. President Trump himself has accused Democrats of using Epstein to deflect from the government shutdown. Meanwhile, some conservative media outlets and influencers are largely ignoring the release, believing their audiences are already fully supportive of Trump. The documents are fueling speculation, but experts caution against taking Epstein's cryptic language at face value. The ongoing discourse surrounding these documents is described as maddening and unproductive by some.
