## Article summary
The Trump Organization is reportedly in discussions for a real estate deal involving a Saudi government-owned development. Jerry Inzerillo, CEO of the Diriyah development, stated that a Trump-branded project is likely to materialize soon, describing it as a matter of time. Saudi officials had previously shown Mr. Trump the Diriyah project during his state visit in May, aiming to capture his interest. This potential deal highlights a pattern of Mr. Trump intertwining his family's business interests with his political roles, particularly in Persian Gulf nations. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, is set to visit Washington next week, creating a scenario where national security discussions could occur alongside potential business dealings with the Trump family. Dar Global, a significant foreign partner of the Trump Organization, has also indicated that new Trump projects in Saudi Arabia are forthcoming. These ventures, which generate licensing fees for the Trump name, are part of Saudi Arabia's large-scale "giga-projects." While the Trump Organization has not officially commented, the statements from Inzerillo and Dar Global suggest active negotiations. The Trump family has been increasingly involved in deals across the Gulf since Mr. Trump left office, including projects in Dubai, Riyadh, and a golf course in Qatar. The Trump Organization's licensing agreements are not public, making the exact terms of these deals unknown.
