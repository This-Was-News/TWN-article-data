## Article summary
Thousands of people rallied in Mexico City to protest escalating crime, corruption, and impunity, with the movement gaining significant momentum and support from older opposition party members. This demonstration was organized by Generation Z, a demographic increasingly vocal about systemic issues. Young participants expressed frustration with corruption and a lack of accountability for violent crimes, with one consultant stating, "We need more security." A physician attending the protest highlighted the pervasive insecurity, noting that even healthcare professionals are not exempt. Despite high approval ratings for President Claudia Sheinbaum, the protest highlights deep-seated concerns within the population. The President has accused right-wing parties of attempting to co-opt the Gen Z movement. While some social media influencers withdrew their support, prominent figures like former President Vicente Fox and businessman Ricardo Salinas Pliego publicly backed the protests. The march saw participation from various age groups, including supporters of a recently assassinated mayor from Michoacan, underscoring the widespread impact of the issues being protested.
