## Article summary
A significant stockpile of U.S.-purchased birth control, intended for sub-Saharan Africa, has become unusable due to improper storage in Belgium. While a portion of the $9.7 million worth of contraceptives remains in a warehouse in Geel, an additional 20 truckloads in Kallo have been deemed largely unusable because they were not stored in compliance with pharmaceutical requirements. This situation arises after the Trump administration scaled back foreign aid, halting family planning programs despite evidence of their life-saving impact. Aid groups attempted to acquire the contraceptives, but their offers were rejected by the U.S., which cited a policy against funding organizations providing abortion services, even though the stockpile contained no abortion methods. The U.S. initially planned to incinerate the products, sparking international outcry and concerns about potential unintended pregnancies, births, unsafe abortions, and maternal deaths. Despite assurances that the stockpile was destroyed, Belgian authorities confirmed in September that the contraceptives were still in a warehouse. Now, with some of the supplies spoiled and diplomatic discussions stalled, humanitarian organizations are urging the U.S. to release the remaining contraceptives to prevent further waste and address critical shortages in African countries facing worsening contraceptive access due to reduced U.S. aid.
