## Article summary
Federal officials have initiated a surge of immigration enforcement operations in Charlotte, North Carolina, with agents reportedly making arrests in various locations. This action follows rumors of increased federal presence and comes amidst heightened political rhetoric surrounding immigration and public safety. Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated the surge aims to ensure Americans are safe by removing public safety threats. However, local officials, including Mayor Vi Lyles, have expressed concern, stating the operations are causing fear and uncertainty among residents. Crime statistics for Charlotte indicate a decrease in homicides, robberies, and other offenses compared to the previous year. The enforcement push has been linked by some to the fatal stabbing of a refugee, with former President Donald Trump's administration using the incident to criticize Democratic-led cities. One documented encounter involved U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents breaking a U.S. citizen's car window during an operation, leading to his temporary detention until he could prove his citizenship. Community organizations have reported an increase in stops by immigration agents, and some businesses, particularly those serving the Latin American community, have closed due to fear of the crackdown. While some local Republicans support the enforcement, viewing it as a mandate from the 2024 election, hundreds of protesters gathered in Charlotte to voice their opposition. Governor Josh Stein noted that many detained individuals lack criminal convictions, and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has clarified its non-involvement in federal immigration enforcement.
