## Article summary
A 38-year-old man, Cody Balmer, pleaded guilty to attempted murder and arson for setting fires inside Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's official residence while the governor, his family, and guests were inside. Balmer was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison under a plea deal. The fire, which caused significant damage, occurred on April 13, 2025, shortly after the family celebrated Passover. Balmer used gasoline in beer bottles to ignite the fire and attempted to break into the sleeping quarters but did not encounter any state police. He later turned himself in. Balmer's family mentioned his mental health struggles, and authorities stated he expressed concerns about the war in Gaza. Governor Shapiro and his wife expressed that the attack has made their family feel unsafe and has caused lasting anxiety. The mansion suffered extensive damage, and security upgrades are being implemented. The cost of the damage is expected to exceed a million dollars.
