## Article summary
Maine Governor Janet Mills has announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, aiming to unseat Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, known for her confrontation with President Trump over transgender athletes, has highlighted her readiness to challenge Trump's influence in Congress. She emphasizes her experience and accomplishments as governor, including education funding, Medicaid expansion, and abortion rights advocacy. Mills faces a competitive primary with candidates like Graham Platner and Jordan Wood, who represent a more progressive stance. Platner, endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders, criticizes the Democratic establishment's approach and advocates for a grassroots campaign. Mills' entry into the race is seen as a significant challenge to Collins, who has held her seat since 1996. Democrats believe Collins is more vulnerable now due to her perceived lack of influence and controversial votes. Mills' campaign focuses on her track record and experience, while her opponents emphasize building a movement within the Democratic Party. The primary race in Maine reflects a broader trend of insurgent Democrats challenging established party leaders.
