## Article summary
During the government shutdown, the Trump administration froze or canceled nearly $28 billion in grants for over 200 projects, primarily in Democratic-led areas. The projects included clean energy, electric grid upgrades, and transportation infrastructure. The administration paused $18 billion for New York's Second Avenue subway and Hudson River tunnel, and $2.1 billion for Chicago's transit upgrades, citing reviews of contracting policies. Additionally, $7.6 billion in energy-related grants for 223 projects in 16 states, mostly led by Democrats, were terminated. The cuts targeted climate and infrastructure funding, prompting questions about political motivations. The administration claimed the projects were not economically viable or aligned with Trump's energy policy agenda. The shutdown has led to threats of further cuts, with potential targets like Portland, Oregon. The Times analyzed federal funding records to determine the impact of these cancellations and pauses.
