## Article summary
President Trump has threatened to cut Democrat programs permanently as the government shutdown continues. He plans to release a list of these programs on Friday. The president aims to weaponize the shutdown to achieve budget cuts he has long sought but not yet approved by Congress. He did not specify which agencies or programs would be affected or whether staff cuts or spending slashes are planned. The administration has already laid off thousands of federal workers and blocked billions in aid to pressure Democrats. The comments mark an escalation in Trump's efforts to use the shutdown to his advantage. The shutdown has entered its third week, with no immediate resolution in sight. Trump appears to be using the situation to push through his desired budget cuts. The president's actions have intensified the political standoff. The shutdown's impact on federal workers and aid programs has been significant.
