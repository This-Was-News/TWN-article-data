## Article summary
NPR will lose access to the Pentagon for refusing to sign a new Defense Department document that restricts journalists from soliciting unclassified information. The policy would prevent NPR from fulfilling its role as a watchdog and force it to merely parrot press releases. Major news outlets, both mainstream and conservative, have refused to sign the new rule, which would bar around 100 Pentagon press from the building. The author, a journalist with 28 years of experience, emphasizes the importance of soliciting information to uncover the truth behind official statements. He recounts instances where his reporting revealed the reality of military operations, contrasting with official narratives. The author highlights the dangers journalists face in combat zones and the importance of their work in holding the government accountable. With the Trump administration providing minimal information, the author expresses concern about the lack of transparency and the potential consequences for democracy. The Pentagon's reliance on social media and partisan outlets is seen as insufficient for informing the public about critical decisions and actions.
