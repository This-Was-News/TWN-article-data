## Article summary
President Donald Trump and his budget chief, Russ Vought, are utilizing the government shutdown to restructure the federal workforce, targeting programs favored by Democrats and prioritizing military funding. The shutdown, now in its third week, has led to layoffs in health, education, and science sectors, with over 4,100 federal workers receiving layoff notices. Vought, a key figure in the conservative Project 2025, is reshaping the federal government's size and scope, actions that have been criticized as illegal and are facing court challenges. Despite the shutdown, Trump's priorities, such as military support and mass deportation, remain largely uninterrupted. Congress is at a standstill, with Democrats demanding healthcare funding and Republicans refusing to negotiate. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has taken unprecedented steps, including encouraging agencies to consider reductions in force and suggesting that furloughed workers may not be eligible for back pay. The shutdown is becoming one of the longest in history, with over 750,000 employees furloughed. The OMB's actions have been compared to authoritarian tactics, with Vought being likened to a 'grim reaper' by critics. The Trump administration has found alternative funding sources to ensure military and Coast Guard personnel are paid. The shutdown highlights the deep political divide, with Democrats and Republicans locked in a stalemate over government funding and policy priorities.
