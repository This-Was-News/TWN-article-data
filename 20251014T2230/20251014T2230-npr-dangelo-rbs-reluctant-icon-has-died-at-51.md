## Article summary
D'Angelo, the pioneering R&B singer known for his neo soul contributions, has passed away at the age of 51 after a battle with cancer. Born Michael Eugene Archer in Richmond, Virginia, he began his career with the group Three of a Kind and won Amateur Night at the Apollo at 16. His debut album, Brown Sugar, released in 1995, blended traditional soul with contemporary R&B and went platinum. Despite his success, D'Angelo struggled with the scrutiny of his fame and creative direction. His landmark album Voodoo, released in 2000, solidified his status as a defining voice in R&B, featuring a unique blend of old-school funk and freeform groove. The album won a Grammy for Best R&B Album, and its hit single Untitled (How Does It Feel) established him as a sex symbol, much to his dismay. After Voodoo, D'Angelo retreated from the spotlight, occasionally collaborating with other artists. He returned in 2014 with Black Messiah, marking a critically acclaimed shift to an analog, progressive soul sound. The 2019 documentary Devil's Pie: D'Angelo provided insight into his meticulous nature and his struggle with fame. D'Angelo's final appearances were sporadic, including a Verzuz show at the Apollo Theater in 2021 and a collaboration with Jay-Z and Jeymes Samuel in 2023.
