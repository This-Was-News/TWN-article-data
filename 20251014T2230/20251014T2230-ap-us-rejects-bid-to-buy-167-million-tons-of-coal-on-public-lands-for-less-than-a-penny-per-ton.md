## Article summary
Federal officials rejected a company's bid to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton, which would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in over a decade. The failed sale highlights the low demand for coal among utilities, which are shifting to cheaper natural gas and renewables. President Trump has aimed to revive the coal industry, but economists believe this decline is unlikely to reverse. The Department of Interior stated that the bid from Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act. The act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. The last successful government lease sale in the region saw Peabody Energy pay $793 million for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming. President Biden's administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin, citing climate change. A second proposed lease sale under Trump for 440 million tons of coal in Wyoming was postponed. NTEC, owned by the Navajo Nation, indicated the coal had little value due to declining demand. Most power plants using NTEC's coal are scheduled to stop burning it in the next decade. Spring Creek mine ships coal overseas, but port capacity shortages hinder increased exports.
