## Article summary
The cease-fire talks in Egypt between Israel and Hamas, facilitated by the U.S. and Arab nations, overcame significant obstacles to reach a compromise. Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, representing the U.S., played a crucial role in pushing both sides to negotiate. Hamas agreed to release Israeli hostages without a complete Israeli withdrawal, while Israel agreed to free Palestinian prisoners. The talks were initially stalled due to maximalist positions from both sides, but American pressure and diplomatic efforts led to a compromise on territorial control in Gaza. The success of the talks was attributed to the mandates given to the negotiators by their respective leaders and the strategic pressure applied by the U.S. and Arab nations. The agreement focused on a cease-fire, hostage and prisoner exchange, and set aside more complex issues for future negotiations. The talks were a culmination of weeks of diplomacy following a botched Israeli strike in Qatar and President Trump's 20-point plan. Both Israel and Hamas faced significant pressure to reach a deal, with Israel seeking to avoid Trump's wrath and Hamas fearing continued Israeli attacks. The final agreement was announced after intense negotiations and was seen as a step toward ending the prolonged conflict.
