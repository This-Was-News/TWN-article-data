## Article summary
Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, asserts that shutdown negotiations are stalled because Republicans are reluctant to act without President Trump's approval. The federal government has been shut down since October 1, with Congress unable to pass either party's proposed spending measures. Republicans seek a clean resolution to fund the government for seven weeks, while Democrats propose funding the government, extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, undoing health spending cuts, and limiting Trump's power to withhold funds. Both sides blame each other for the shutdown, with House Speaker Mike Johnson warning of a prolonged shutdown unless Democrats drop their demands. Kaine argues that Democrats' plan is an alternative to address healthcare issues created by Trump and the GOP. The shutdown impacts federal employees, particularly in Virginia, where over 4% of non-farm workers are federal employees. Kaine highlights additional concerns in Virginia, including layoffs and funding cuts since Trump's return to the White House. The administration is proceeding with plans to lay off federal employees, with over 4,000 workers receiving reduction in force notices. Kaine and Trump agree on ensuring troops are paid during the shutdown, with Trump directing the Pentagon to use unused funds for this purpose. Kaine calls for Trump and Republicans to engage in productive talks to resolve the shutdown quickly, suggesting it could be solved in 48 hours with presidential involvement.
