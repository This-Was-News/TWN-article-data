## Article summary
A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is being tested after an exchange of hostages and detainees. The ceasefire, aimed at ending a two-year war that has devastated Gaza, is fragile, with Hamas accusing Israel of breaking the truce. At least six Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in northern and central Gaza. The United Nations' humanitarian office in Gaza reported that Israel would reduce aid to Gaza due to Hamas not handing over all hostage bodies. Eight bodies have been handed over to Israel, with Hamas stating it will take time to find all remains. Israel celebrated the return of 20 living hostages held by Hamas since 2023, while Palestinians welcomed back about 1,700 Gazans detained by Israel. The freed hostages were in relatively good health but had been starved and lost significant weight. Palestinian detainees, including women and children, were released from Israeli custody. Israel also released over 240 prisoners, mostly from the West Bank, and deported 154 of them. Israel refused to release high-profile prisoners like Marwan Barghouti and still holds Gaza doctors and medical staff. President Trump addressed Israel's parliament, praising his support for Israel and brokering the ceasefire. A 'peace summit' in Egypt, co-chaired by Trump, included leaders from nearly 30 countries. The summit aimed to support the next phases of the ceasefire agreement, with discussions on Hamas disarmament, governance of Gaza, and Palestinian statehood. The war has killed tens of thousands, and the immediate focus is on aid, reconstruction, and long-term stability in the region.
