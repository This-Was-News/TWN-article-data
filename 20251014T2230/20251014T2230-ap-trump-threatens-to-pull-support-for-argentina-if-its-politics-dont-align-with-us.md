## Article summary
President Donald Trump met with Argentine President Javier Milei and threatened to withdraw U.S. assistance if Argentina's political outcomes do not align with U.S. interests. Trump emphasized that the $20 billion aid to Argentina, denied as a bailout, is tied to Milei's success in upcoming elections. Milei praised Trump's leadership and their shared economic philosophies. The aid comes amid Argentina's economic struggles, including rising unemployment and a weakening peso. Critics argue Trump is favoring a political ally at taxpayers' expense. The U.S. intervention includes a currency swap to stabilize Argentina's economy. Milei hopes to delay a peso devaluation until after the midterm elections to maintain his economic reforms. The aid follows a previous IMF loan, raising concerns about Argentina's ability to repay. The meeting also discussed a potential AI project in Argentina. Despite the support, Milei's government has already missed early IMF targets for rebuilding reserves.
