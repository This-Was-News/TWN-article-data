## Article summary
The Trump administration revoked the visas of six foreigners from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay, and South Africa for making derisive comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The State Department reviewed their online posts and clips about Kirk, who was killed while speaking at a Utah college campus. The announcement coincided with President Trump posthumously awarding Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling him a great American hero. The administration has targeted individuals for their comments about Kirk, leading to firings and disciplinary actions, raising free speech concerns. Vice President JD Vance and other officials encouraged reporting offensive language about Kirk online. The administration has also increased efforts to identify and potentially expel foreigners involved in unrest or protests against Israel's operations in Gaza. It has denied visas to applicants critical of its policies and is reviewing the status of over 55 million current U.S. visa holders. Civil rights groups have criticized these actions as violations of constitutional free speech protections.
