## Article summary
Natalie Grabow, an 80-year-old grandmother from New Jersey, made history by becoming the oldest woman to finish the Ironman World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Just 20 years ago, she learned to swim to overcome a major hurdle and compete in triathlons. Grabow swam 2.4 miles, cycled 112 miles, and ran a marathon, completing the grueling course within the 17-hour cutoff time. She was the sole entrant in her age group and was supported by her daughter and coach. Her finish was met with cheers and chants from the crowd. Grabow's journey began in 2005 when she started learning to swim and later entered sprint triathlons. She has since competed in 11 Ironman World Championships. Grabow's success is attributed to her grit, gratitude, and love for the sport. She plans to continue racing in 2026, signing up for two half Ironman events. Her story inspires others to take on new challenges at any age.
