## Article summary
A federal judge in San Francisco temporarily halted layoffs by the Trump administration during the ongoing government shutdown. The lawsuit was brought by unions representing over 800,000 federal workers, accusing the administration of using the shutdown to implement illegal layoffs. Judge Susan Illston granted a temporary restraining order to pause layoffs and block further notices at more than 30 agencies. The Trump administration argued that the court lacks jurisdiction and that the unions had not shown irreparable harm. Illston expressed frustration with the government's unwillingness to address the legality of the layoffs. The layoffs targeted various agencies, including the Department of Education, Housing and Urban Development, and the CDC. Errors in issuing layoff notices were noted, with some notices being reversed. The unions argue that the administration is violating laws and congressional mandates. The judge ordered the administration to file an accounting of layoffs and comply with the order. A second hearing is scheduled to consider an indefinite pause on layoffs. This is the second case involving Trump's mass layoffs that Illston is presiding over this year.
