## Article summary
Health insurance premiums in the U.S. are rising significantly, with the average annual premium for a family of four exceeding $25,500. Employers and workers share these costs, but premiums have surged over 24% since 2019. Factors driving up costs include high drug prices, increased demand for medical services post-pandemic, and consolidation in the healthcare industry. About 154 million Americans rely on employer-based health insurance, and many may face higher paycheck deductions next year. Some companies, however, are covering their employees' premiums entirely. Boston Consulting Group, for instance, pays all premiums for its employees and their families, viewing it as an investment in productivity and retention. While rare, about 12% of large employers offer zero-premium plans, and some nonprofits and startups also provide this benefit. Companies like Zocdoc and Bartesian offer zero-premium insurance, though with some trade-offs such as higher deductibles or fewer other benefits. These employers believe that covering health care costs helps attract and retain talent, fostering a healthier and more productive workforce.
