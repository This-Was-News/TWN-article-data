## Article summary
In Lesotho, US aid cuts have severely disrupted HIV treatment and prevention programs, leaving many vulnerable individuals without access to crucial services. Mothers struggle to find HIV testing, clinics are closing, and health workers have been laid off, forcing patients to ration or share medication. The cuts have led to a resurgence of HIV transmission and increased health costs. Despite temporary reinstatement of some programs, the long-term impact remains uncertain, with many fearing a setback of up to 15 years in the fight against HIV. The situation highlights the need for Lesotho to become more self-reliant in its public health efforts, but the transition has been chaotic and disruptive. Patients and health workers express deep disappointment and concern about the future, as the cuts have caused irreparable harm and uncertainty.
