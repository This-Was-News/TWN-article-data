## Article summary
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly criticized the state GOP after racist and homophobic messages from Kansas Young Republicans leaders were exposed. The Kansas GOP condemned the messages but Kelly noted their social media posts contradict their statements against racism. The Kansas GOP had shared edited photos of Kelly and Laura Howard, referencing a standoff over SNAP data. Kelly linked the GOP's social media posts to the leaked comments. Kansas GOP Executive Director Rob Fillion responded, accusing Democrats of overusing terms like racism and sexism. The controversy involves former Kansas Young Republicans leaders Alex Dwyer and William Hendrix. The Kansas GOP had become inactive following the exposure of the messages. The dispute also involves a request by the USDA for sensitive data about Kansas SNAP users, which Howard has refused due to privacy concerns. Republican lawmakers argue the data is needed to detect food assistance fraud, particularly among immigrants without legal status. Kelly has refused to comply with the USDA's request, citing privacy concerns.
