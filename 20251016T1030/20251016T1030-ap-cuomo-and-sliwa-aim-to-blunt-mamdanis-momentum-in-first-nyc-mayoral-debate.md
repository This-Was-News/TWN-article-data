## Article summary
The first debate of the New York City mayoral election features Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa aiming to halt Zohran Mamdani's momentum. Cuomo, running as an independent, seeks a political comeback after resigning as governor amid sexual harassment allegations. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, leads in polls but faces criticism for past controversial statements. Sliwa, a Republican, hopes to capitalize on a split Democratic vote. Mamdani's economic populism and calls to raise taxes on the wealthy have generated buzz but also unease among some voters. Cuomo portrays Mamdani as a dangerous leader and positions himself as a competent manager. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams suspended his reelection campaign due to a dismissed federal corruption case. A recent poll shows Mamdani leading Cuomo, with Adams' exit having little impact on the race. The candidates will meet for a final debate next week.
