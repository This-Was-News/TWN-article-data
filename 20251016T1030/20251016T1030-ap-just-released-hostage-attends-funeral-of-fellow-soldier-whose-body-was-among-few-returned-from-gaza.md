## Article summary
Two hostages released by Hamas attended the funeral of their fellow soldier, Capt. Daniel Peretz, in Jerusalem. Matan Angrest, one of the released hostages, paid his respects to Peretz and prayed for the return of Sgt. Itay Chen, whose body remains in Gaza. The three soldiers were taken during a Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which resulted in 1,200 deaths and 251 hostages. Under the ceasefire terms, Hamas is supposed to return all deceased hostages' bodies, but only 10 have been released so far. Families are struggling with the inability to bury their loved ones according to Jewish traditions, which emphasize the importance of a quick and respectful burial. The delay in returning the bodies is causing immense emotional distress for the families. Many families feel betrayed by the suggestion that the crisis is over and that hostage posters can be taken down. The ongoing struggle involves government negotiators and family prayers to bring back all the remains. The funerals and mourning rituals are crucial for both spiritual and psychological healing. The country and the families cannot fully heal until all hostages are returned.
