## Article summary
Dozens of reporters left the Pentagon rather than agree to new government-imposed restrictions on their work, marking a significant stand against the Defense Department's new rules. The rules, imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they reported on unapproved information. Many reporters left together at a 4 p.m. deadline, carrying their belongings out of the building. The new rules have been widely rejected by news organizations, which vowed to continue robust coverage of the military. The move is unlikely to sway President Donald Trump's supporters, many of whom resent journalists. Hegseth has previously restricted the flow of information, holding few press briefings and banning reporters from certain areas. Journalists see the new rules as an attempt to control the narrative. Several reporters posted on social media about turning in their press badges, emphasizing their commitment to continue their work. The Pentagon Press Association and various news outlets have spoken out against the rules. Only the conservative One America News Network agreed to the new rules, likely seeking greater access to the Trump administration.
