## Article summary
Nexperia, a Dutch chip maker owned by Chinese company Wingtech, was taken over by the Dutch government under pressure from U.S. officials due to its inclusion in a U.S. trade blacklist. The company's global supply chain spans Europe, the U.S., and Asia, producing older types of chips used in cars and electronics. The Dutch government cited emergency measures to ensure product availability, while court documents revealed U.S. pressure regarding Nexperia's Chinese ownership. The U.S. has been expanding controls over tech supply chains, targeting Chinese companies. China has also imposed restrictions on Nexperia's exports and sanctioned American subsidiaries of a South Korean shipping company. The situation highlights the escalating battle between the U.S. and China for control over global tech supply chains, with governments seeking to regain control of critical technology manufacturing.
