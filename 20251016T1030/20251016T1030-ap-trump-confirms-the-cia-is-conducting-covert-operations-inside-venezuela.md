## Article summary
President Donald Trump confirmed that he has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela and is considering land operations. This follows recent U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean, with at least five boats destroyed and 27 people killed. Trump cited the release of prisoners into the U.S. and drug trafficking as reasons for the authorization. He did not confirm if the CIA has authority to target Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Maduro criticized the U.S. and CIA actions, referencing past conflicts and coups in Latin America. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry condemned Trump's statements as violations of international law. The Trump administration's declaration of drug cartels as unlawful combatants has sparked bipartisan criticism in Congress, with concerns about transparency and oversight. Lawmakers have also questioned the evidence supporting the strikes and the administration's criteria for targeting. Human rights groups have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes.
