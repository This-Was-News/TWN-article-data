## Article summary
Chinese state media is rallying public sentiment and posting old propaganda footage as the trade war with the U.S. intensifies. The media has shared a video of Mao Zedong's battle cry from 1953, referencing the Korean War, to portray China's current struggle with the U.S. as an existential battle. The latest trade war escalations include U.S. threats of 100 percent tariffs, Chinese export controls on rare earth minerals, and mutual port fees. Despite the rhetoric, Chinese officials are cautious, leaving room for talks with President Trump. The propaganda machine is promoting resilience and patriotism, but officials are avoiding overly aggressive language to maintain diplomatic flexibility. Experts note that China's leaders are mindful of the risks of fanning nationalism, as it can complicate de-escalation efforts. The current situation follows months of tit-for-tat retaliation, with both sides imposing various sanctions and trade restrictions. The Chinese leadership is balancing public sentiment with the need for potential reconciliation with the U.S.
