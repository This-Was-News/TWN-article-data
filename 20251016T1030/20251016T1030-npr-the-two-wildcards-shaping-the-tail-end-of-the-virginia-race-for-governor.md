## Article summary
The Virginia gubernatorial race between Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears is being influenced by two late-emerging issues. The first is the impact of federal job cuts and the government shutdown on Virginia's large federal workforce, which has motivated many Democrats to vote. The second is a scandal involving violent text messages sent by the Democratic candidate for attorney general, which Republicans are using to energize conservative voters. The election is seen as a test of voter sentiment, with high stakes as governors play key roles in supporting or opposing the Trump administration's policies. Spanberger has focused on the rising cost of living and federal workforce cuts, while Earle-Sears has criticized Spanberger for not calling on Virginia Democrats to end the shutdown. Earle-Sears has also ramped up calls to ban transgender students from girls' spaces, appealing to conservative voters. Early voting is underway, with over 400,000 votes cast. The outcome of the election is expected to impact down-ballot races and reflect voter sentiment towards the Trump administration.
