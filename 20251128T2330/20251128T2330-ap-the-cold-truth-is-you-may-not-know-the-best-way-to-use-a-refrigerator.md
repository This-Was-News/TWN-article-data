## Article summary
Proper food storage is crucial for prolonging freshness, minimizing waste, and preventing foodborne illnesses. While refrigeration is a primary method, understanding how long foods have been exposed and stored is essential, as even refrigerated items can develop harmful microorganisms. Experts emphasize that proper storage begins before groceries reach the refrigerator, advising to purchase items before their sell-by dates and refrigerate them within two hours of room temperature. Maintaining refrigerator temperatures between 35-38 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7-3.3 degrees Celsius) is recommended. Different types of produce require specific storage conditions; for example, berries should be kept dry and washed just before eating, while tomatoes, pears, and apples emit ethylene gas that can speed up ripening of other items. Onions and potatoes are best stored outside the refrigerator to prevent sprouting and starch conversion. Uncooked meat should be stored at the bottom of the refrigerator to prevent cross-contamination, and eggs should be kept on middle or back shelves. Milk, yogurt, and cheeses require refrigeration, with specific placement recommendations to prevent drying out. Bread is best stored at room temperature, though refrigeration can slow mold growth in humid climates. Leftovers can be refrigerated for 3-4 days or frozen for 3-4 months. Understanding temperature and humidity is key to effective food storage, with personal preference and timing of meals also playing a role.
