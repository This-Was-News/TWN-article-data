## Article summary
Winter storm warnings are in effect across the northern United States through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, bringing snow, cold, and hazardous travel conditions. The National Weather Service has issued warnings and advisories stretching from Montana to New York, with significant snowfall expected in areas like Iowa and Illinois, potentially reaching up to a foot. While blizzard conditions are not currently forecasted, snow squalls with whiteout conditions are possible in the interior Northeast. The storm that brought snow to the northern Plains and Great Lakes region is expected to continue, with heavy snowfall anticipated in parts of Michigan and New York. In the Pacific Northwest and Rockies, a mix of snow and rain is forecast, with snow tapering off by Saturday in the Rockies and northern Plains. Meanwhile, the western Gulf Coast may experience flash flooding on Saturday. Temperatures are significantly below average in the eastern and central U.S., with highs in the 20s and 30s Fahrenheit in the Midwest and New England. The snowy weather has already caused vehicle crashes in western Michigan. Travelers are advised to stay informed about changing weather conditions.
