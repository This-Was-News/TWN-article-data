## Article summary
President Donald Trump has declared his intention to "permanently pause migration" from poorer nations through a strong anti-immigrant statement on social media. This declaration followed the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington D.C., one of whom died. The suspect in the shooting was an Afghan national who had assisted American troops. Trump asserted that "only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation" and stated that those who "hate, steal, murder, and destroy" would not remain in the country long. His vow to halt immigration could significantly impact the U.S., a nation historically defined by its welcoming stance towards immigrants. Trump's past actions include raids and deportations that have disrupted communities, and further deportations could pose economic risks given the substantial contribution of foreign-born workers to the U.S. economy. He also broadly claimed that most foreign-born residents are on welfare, come from prisons or gangs, and are responsible for crime, a claim contradicted by academic research. Studies indicate that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes and are incarcerated at lower rates than U.S.-born citizens. Despite this evidence, Trump's rhetoric has intensified, including calls to re-examine Afghan refugees and a statement from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services about increased screening for individuals from 19 "high-risk" countries.
