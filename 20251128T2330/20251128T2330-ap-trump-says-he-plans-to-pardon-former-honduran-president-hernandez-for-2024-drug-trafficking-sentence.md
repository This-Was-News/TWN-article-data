## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced his intention to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted of drug trafficking and weapons charges in 2024 and sentenced to 45 years in prison. Trump stated that many people he respects believe Hernandez was treated harshly and unfairly. Hernandez's lawyer expressed gratitude for Trump's action, calling it a "great injustice" being righted. Trump also endorsed Nasry Tito Asfura for Honduras's presidency, warning of "catastrophic results" if the country elects the "wrong Leader." Asfura, a conservative National Party candidate, is running for president for the second time. Trump framed the Honduran election as a test for democracy, suggesting a loss for Asfura could lead Honduras towards the influence of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. Trump has previously taken action against drug trafficking in Venezuela, including military strikes and increased naval presence. Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has maintained a pragmatic stance with the U.S. administration. Argentine President Javier Milei also voiced his support for Asfura, opposing leftist leadership in Honduras.
