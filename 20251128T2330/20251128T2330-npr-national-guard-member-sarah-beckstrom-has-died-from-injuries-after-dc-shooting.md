## Article summary
West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom has died from injuries sustained in a shooting incident in Washington, D.C. She and fellow Guard member Andrew Wolfe were on patrol near the White House when they were shot by an Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal. President Trump announced Beckstrom's death and stated that Wolfe was "fighting for his life." The alleged gunman, who reportedly drove from Washington state, used a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver in what officials described as a "targeted attack." Lakanwal came to the U.S. in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome and had previously worked with U.S. intelligence agencies. Following the shooting, the CIA criticized the Biden administration's decision to admit Lakanwal into the country. U.S. Attorneys are seeking terrorism charges, with potential penalties including life in prison or the death penalty. The incident has prompted a review of immigration protocols for Afghan nationals and a halt in processing their applications. President Trump also ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops to D.C., adding to the existing deployment that has faced legal challenges.
