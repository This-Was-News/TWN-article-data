## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV visited the historic site of the First Council of Nicaea in Iznik, Turkey, to pray for Christian unity. This council, held 1,700 years ago, produced the Nicene Creed, a foundational statement of Christian belief. The Pope joined Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox Christians, at the ruins of a submerged basilica revealed by receding water levels. Pope Leo emphasized the rejection of religion for violence and the importance of fraternal encounter and dialogue. He has been advocating for unity among Christian denominations and other religions during his inaugural foreign trip. The First Council of Nicaea was convened by Emperor Constantine to address a doctrinal crisis regarding the nature of Jesus. The council ultimately rejected Arianism, affirming Jesus' divinity. The exact location of the council was discovered only about 11 years ago. The Church experienced a major division with the Great Schism of 1054. Pope Leo and Patriarch Bartholomew held a joint prayer service at the ruins, highlighting the creed as a common heritage. They are set to sign a joint declaration to symbolize modern unity.
