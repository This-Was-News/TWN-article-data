## Article summary
President Donald Trump has announced a "permanent pause" on immigration from "third world" countries following a shooting in Washington, D.C., that resulted in the death of a National Guard member. Trump stated on social media that he would "permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover." He also suggested that "REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation." The Trump administration has been deporting immigrants to their home countries or to third countries, with some nations paid to accept deportees. The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services indicated a "full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern." A previous White House proclamation had already placed travel bans on 12 countries, many of which are in Africa, as well as Afghanistan. The alleged shooter in the D.C. incident was identified as an Afghan national who had been admitted to the U.S. in 2021. Trump blamed the Biden administration for the shooter's entry and for general failures in the immigration system. He also broadened his criticism to include immigrants from Somalia, accusing them of gang affiliation and causing trouble. Officials from the United Nations criticized Trump's call for immigration halts, stating that immigrants are entitled to protection under international law and due process.
