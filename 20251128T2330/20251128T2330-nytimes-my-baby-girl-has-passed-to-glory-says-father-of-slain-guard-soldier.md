## Article summary
Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of the West Virginia Army National Guard, has died from injuries sustained in an ambush shooting near the White House. Her father, Gary Beckstrom, announced her passing, stating, 'My baby girl has passed to glory.' The other Guard member injured in the attack, Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, of the West Virginia Air National Guard, remains in critical condition. The shooting occurred when a man, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, allegedly opened fire on the two Guard members who were on patrol. Lakanwal, an Afghan national, was subdued by other Guard members and is expected to face charges. Specialist Beckstrom joined the Guard in 2023 and aspired to a career in law enforcement. Sergeant Wolfe entered the service in 2019 and works as a lineman. Both Guard members had been deployed to Washington since August. Tributes have poured in for Specialist Beckstrom, remembering her as caring and tenderhearted, and for Sergeant Wolfe, described as strong and determined. Communities in West Virginia are holding vigils and lowering flags to honor the fallen and injured Guard members. Governor Patrick Morrisey has ordered a statewide moment of silence and flags to be flown at half-staff in Specialist Beckstrom's honor.
