## Article summary
A college freshman, Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, was deported to Honduras from Boston Logan International Airport while attempting to fly home for a Thanksgiving surprise. The 19-year-old Babson College student was detained by immigration officials despite her attorney's claims of a closed case and unawareness of a 2015 deportation order. Her attorney stated that she was heartbroken and her college dream was shattered. A federal judge issued an emergency order to prevent her removal hours after her arrest, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reportedly violated this order. Lopez Belloza, who left Honduras at age 7, was unaware of any removal proceedings. She expressed her devastation at losing everything, including the opportunity to share her first semester of business studies with her family. Her attorney is seeking proof of the alleged decade-old order that resulted in her deportation.
