## Article summary
Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) was a U.S. program established in 2021 to resettle Afghans who were at risk of Taliban persecution, particularly those who had assisted American forces. The program allowed Afghans to enter the U.S. on parole for two years, with the expectation they would seek other means to stay, such as asylum. Approximately 40% of the evacuees were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas due to their work with the U.S. or family ties. OAW was followed by Operation Enduring Welcome, and together these programs resettled nearly 200,000 Afghans in the U.S. The vetting process for OAW involved rigorous screenings by intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism professionals, including biometric and biographic checks. However, criticisms arose regarding the thoroughness of vetting, with reports from the DHS Office of Inspector General and the Department of Justice acknowledging some data inaccuracies and the potential for bad actors to exploit expedited evacuation processes. The FBI flagged 55 evacuees who were later identified on terrorism watch lists, though the majority were not considered security risks. Following a recent shooting incident involving an Afghan national who entered under OAW, there have been renewed calls to re-examine and potentially remove individuals who entered the country through the program. In response, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has halted processing immigration applications from Afghan nationals, leaving tens of thousands in limbo.
