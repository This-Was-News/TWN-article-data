## Article summary
Charges against Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national accused of shooting two National Guard members, have been upgraded to first-degree murder following the death of Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition. Lakanwal, who previously worked with the CIA, entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome and lived in Washington state. President Trump has labeled the shooting a terrorist attack and called for a reinvestigation of Afghan refugees. Beckstrom, a military police officer, volunteered for the mission in Washington D.C. and is remembered for her leadership and dedication. Investigators are actively working to determine Lakanwal's motive. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited the injured soldier and offered prayers. The governor of West Virginia ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of Beckstrom. Lakanwal's former landlord described him as quiet and a limited English speaker, while a neighbor noted he was struggling to find work. Lakanwal had briefly worked as an Amazon Flex delivery driver.
