## Article summary
A federal magistrate judge, Za Faruqui, criticized top Justice Department prosecutors for allegedly violating the civil rights of individuals arrested during President Donald Trump's law-enforcement surge in Washington, D.C. Faruqui accused U.S. Attorney Jeanne Prros's office of damaging its reputation by bringing inappropriate cases to federal court and unnecessarily detaining people. He stated that the office has lost all credibility. Prro responded by accusing Faruqui of political bias. The conflict highlights tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary. Faruqui made these remarks during a hearing where he dismissed a case against Edward Alexander Dana, who was accused of threatening to kill Trump. The case was dismissed after a grand jury refused to indict Dana. Faruqui criticized the administration for prioritizing arrest statistics over the impact on individuals' lives. Prro defended her office's actions, arguing that the grand jury's decision was politically motivated. The White House reported over 1,800 arrests since the operation began, with 40 cases filed in district court. Dana's attorney argued that the case should not have been in federal court. Faruqui ordered prosecutors to explain their charging decisions and apologized to Dana on behalf of the court.
