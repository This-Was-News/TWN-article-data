## Article summary
A federal appeals court panel has temporarily halted a lower court's order to shut down the 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention center in the Florida Everglades. The panel voted 2-1 to stay the order pending an appeal, citing public interest. The facility, built by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' administration, has been criticized for lacking environmental reviews. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams had ordered the facility to cease operations by the end of October. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued, arguing federal law requires environmental reviews for such facilities. Governor DeSantis celebrated the appeals court's decision, stating the facility remains open. The Department of Homeland Security also supported the ruling, claiming the lawsuit was driven by open-borders activists. The state and federal governments appealed the lower court's decision, arguing the environmental impact statement does not apply to states.
