## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense scrutiny during a contentious Senate Finance Committee hearing regarding his tenure as health secretary. Known for his skepticism towards vaccines, Kennedy has made significant changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including replacing vaccine advisors with critics and dismissing the CDC director. Senators from both parties questioned his efforts to restrict vaccine access, particularly for COVID-19 vaccines, which have led to confusion and barriers for Americans seeking immunization. Kennedy defended his stance on mRNA technology, despite President Trump's previous support for it, and maintained that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful. The hearing highlighted Kennedy's combative approach, with heated exchanges over his contradictory statements and lack of data to support his claims. The turmoil at the CDC, marked by layoffs and a recent shooting, is expected to worsen as Kennedy plans further reorganizations. Concerns about conflicts of interest arose, as Kennedy replaced vetted vaccine panel members with individuals who have opposed vaccines. Additionally, discussions touched on the impact of policy changes on rural hospitals and pharmacy benefit managers, with debates over funding and healthcare affordability.
