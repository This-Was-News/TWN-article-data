## Article summary
New York Attorney General Letitia James has appealed to the state's highest court to reinstate the civil fraud penalty against former President Donald Trump, which was significantly reduced by a lower court. The Appellate Division had previously slashed the potential $515 million fine to $0, citing the U.S. Constitution's ban on excessive fines, but upheld other punishments, including a ban on Trump and his sons from holding corporate leadership positions in New York. James, a Democrat, had previously indicated she would appeal the decision. Trump, a Republican, has also filed his own appeal, seeking to overturn the other punishments. His legal team accused James of pursuing a political agenda against him. The lawsuit, filed in 2022, alleges that Trump inflated his net worth by billions and misled banks and insurers about the value of his assets. After a trial, Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that Trump had engaged in a long-term conspiracy to deceive financial institutions. The Appellate Division panel was divided on many issues but agreed that the monetary penalty was excessive.
