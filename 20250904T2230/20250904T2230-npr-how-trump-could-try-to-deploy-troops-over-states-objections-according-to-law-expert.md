## Article summary
President Trump has been discussing the deployment of National Guard troops to various states, despite legal uncertainties. He has publicly urged Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, to request troops, while Pritzker has refused, stating his state does not want them. Trump has also considered sending troops to New Orleans, where Louisiana's Republican governor has welcomed the idea. A federal judge recently ruled that Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles was illegal, though this ruling only applies to California. Legal expert Stephen Vladeck suggests that Trump may attempt to deploy troops from states friendly to him to those that do not want them, a move that would be unprecedented. Vladeck explains that while Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act to send troops without a governor's consent, he seems to be seeking a way to do so without using this controversial statute. The situation highlights the legal and political complexities of deploying National Guard troops across state lines. Vladeck also notes that governors have their own National Guard units and can deploy them independently if they deem it necessary. The potential legal battle could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, depending on Trump's actions.
