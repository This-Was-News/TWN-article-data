## Article summary
Creatine supplements have gained popularity due to claims of benefits like muscle growth, improved athletic performance, and cognitive enhancements. Creatine is a compound made from amino acids, naturally produced by the body and found in red meat, chicken, and fish. Research supports its effectiveness in increasing muscle mass and enhancing performance in short bursts of activity. Combining creatine with carbohydrates can also boost endurance and aid recovery. While eating more meat can increase creatine levels, supplements are more practical. Studies show that creatine, when combined with resistance training, can help adults gain lean muscle mass, which is significant for older individuals prone to muscle loss. Emerging research suggests potential benefits for bone health, but evidence is still limited. Other claimed benefits, such as regulating blood sugar and improving cognitive function, are not strongly supported yet. Vegans and vegetarians may benefit more from creatine supplements due to lower dietary intake. Creatine is generally safe for adults but should be avoided by those with kidney disease. It's recommended to use creatine monohydrate and ensure supplements are certified by third-party programs like NSF Certified for Sport. Individual responses vary, with some people not experiencing performance improvements. Starting strategies include a loading dose or a daily intake of 5 grams, with maintenance doses of 3 to 5 grams per day.
