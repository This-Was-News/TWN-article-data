## Article summary
A contentious three-hour hearing between U.S. senators and Robert Kennedy Jr. turned into multiple shouting matches as the nation's health secretary defended his changes to vaccines, healthcare policy, and leadership. The Senate Finance Committee oversight hearing focused on high-profile departures at the CDC, the appointment of vaccine critics to a federal advisory committee, and changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations that make it harder for many Americans to get the shots. Both Democrats and Republicans questioned Kennedy's promises regarding vaccine access. Kennedy disputed the account of former CDC director Susan Monarez, who alleged she was told to preapprove recommendations by Kennedy's handpicked vaccine advisors. Kennedy acknowledged firing several senior CDC officials and accused the agency's scientists of failing to combat chronic disease. Throughout the hearing, Kennedy accused senators of lying and misrepresenting his agency, leading to heated exchanges. Democrats pressed Kennedy on changes narrowing the approval of annual COVID-19 shots, while Republicans questioned his assessment of Operation Warp Speed. Kennedy claimed uncertainty about the number of Americans who died from COVID-19 due to lack of government data, despite CDC and WHO estimates. Republicans were more aggressive with Kennedy than with most of Trump's officials, expressing concerns about vaccine access and research funding cuts.
