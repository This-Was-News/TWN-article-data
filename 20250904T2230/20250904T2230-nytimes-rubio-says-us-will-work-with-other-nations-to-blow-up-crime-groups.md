## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. will assist partner governments in conducting violent strikes against criminal groups, following a lethal attack on a boat in the Caribbean. Rubio made these comments in Ecuador, where he met with Foreign Minister Gabriela Sommerfeld and President Daniel Noboa. The State Department designated two Ecuadorian crime groups, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations, allowing for financial penalties on associated individuals. The U.S. has also designated several Mexican and Venezuelan crime groups as terrorist organizations. Rubio announced additional funding to combat drug trafficking and crime in Ecuador, including $6 million for drone equipment. He emphasized the need for stability and security to attract American investment. Rubio also discussed deporting non-citizen migrants from the U.S. to Ecuador and pressured Ecuador to reduce economic ties with China. The U.S. and Ecuador are negotiating a new extradition treaty. Rubio's visit follows a U.S. strike on a boat linked to the Venezuelan criminal group Tren de Aragua, which killed 11 people. The Trump administration views this as the beginning of a broader war on crime and terrorism in the region.
