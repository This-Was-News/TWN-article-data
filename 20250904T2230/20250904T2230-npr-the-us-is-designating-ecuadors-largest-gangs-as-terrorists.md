## Article summary
The U.S. is designating two of Ecuador's most powerful gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations. Secretary of State Marco Rubo announced this during a visit to Ecuador, where he met with President Danel Noboa. The designation allows the U.S. to freeze assets, target associates, and share intelligence with Ecuador. Rubo pledged $13.5 million in security assistance and $6 million in drone technology to support Ecuador's fight against organized crime. Noboa, a close ally of the U.S., has declared a 'war' on organized crime as violence in Ecuador surges. The country is a major transit route for cocaine, with roughly 70% of the world's supply passing through. The surge in cartel violence has fueled migration from Ecuador to the U.S. border. Noboa seeks stronger U.S. and European involvement in his crackdown and wants to hold a referendum to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador. Rubo's visit follows high-level meetings in Mexico, where he warned of more U.S. military action against drug traffickers. The Trump administration recently struck a Venezuelan boat allegedly carrying narcotics, killing 11 people. Venezuelan officials criticized the strike, while Rubo defended it as eliminating an immediate threat. Despite legal and sovereignty concerns, the U.S. is signaling a tougher regional approach to combating narco-terrorism.
