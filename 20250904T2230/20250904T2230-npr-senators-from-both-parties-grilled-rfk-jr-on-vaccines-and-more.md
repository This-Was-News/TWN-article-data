## Article summary
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense scrutiny from both Democratic and Republican senators during a heated Senate hearing. Republicans praised President Trump's Operation Warp Speed and questioned Kennedy's stance on vaccines, particularly his decision to cancel mRNA research funding and limit COVID vaccine access. Senator Bill Cassidy, a critical vote in Kennedy's confirmation, accused him of breaking promises to maintain vaccine access. Kennedy defended his actions, claiming the changes were necessary to restore the CDC's credibility. Senators also questioned Kennedy about his decision to remove newly confirmed CDC chief Susan Monarez, whom he claimed was untrustworthy. Democrats criticized Kennedy's approach to vaccines, with Senator Ron Wyden and Senator Elizabeth Warren accusing him of making it harder for children to get vaccinated and breaking his confirmation promises. Kennedy argued that he is not anti-vaccine but pro-science, advocating for more research into potential risks. Despite his defenses, Democratic senators called for his resignation throughout the hearing.
