## Article summary
Fox News executives privately criticized U.S. Attorney Jeanne Pirro, calling her a 'reckless maniac' and expressing concerns about her responsibility and tendency to promote conspiracy theories. Pirro, a former Fox News host, was a prominent supporter of President Trump's baseless election fraud claims. Legal documents from a defamation lawsuit by Smartmatic reveal these internal exchanges. Pirro, now the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, faces scrutiny over her aggressive crime crackdown, with some charges not sticking. Fox News argues that Pirro's statements were newsworthy and protected by the First Amendment, while Smartmatic disputes this. The lawsuit highlights tensions within Fox News over Pirro's role and the network's handling of election-related claims.
