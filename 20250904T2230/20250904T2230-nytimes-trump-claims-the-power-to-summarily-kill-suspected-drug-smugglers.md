## Article summary
President Trump has ordered the U.S. military to summarily kill suspected drug smugglers, a move that lacks clear legal precedent and raises significant legal and ethical concerns. By shifting maritime counterdrug efforts from law enforcement to wartime rules, Trump is redefining drug trafficking as an armed conflict, allowing the military to kill suspected smugglers on sight. This action has sparked debate among legal experts, who question the president's authority to bypass due process and the potential for mistakenly killing innocent people. The White House defends the strike as consistent with the laws of armed conflict, but critics argue it sets a dangerous precedent. The strike has escalated Trump's use of military power in ways previously considered off-limits, including invoking wartime deportation laws and deploying troops domestically. Trump's harsh stance on drug dealers aligns with his admiration for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's violent drug war. The policy raises concerns about relying on intelligence to identify targets accurately and the risk of disastrous consequences based on faulty intelligence. Legal experts also highlight the treacherous legal issues involved, including potential war crimes if civilians are deliberately killed. The White House's justification hinges on interpreting the law to allow Trump to kill drug smugglers, a move that would significantly expand presidential power.
