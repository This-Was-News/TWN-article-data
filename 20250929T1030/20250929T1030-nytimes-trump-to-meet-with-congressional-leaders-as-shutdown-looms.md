## Article summary
President Trump is set to meet with top congressional leaders to discuss avoiding a government shutdown, but both sides are entrenched in their positions. Democrats refuse to support a Republican stopgap measure without additional healthcare funding, while Republicans refuse to make concessions. The meeting is the first time Trump has invited Democratic leaders to the White House this term. Both parties acknowledge room for negotiation but are skeptical of a compromise. Democrats demand funding for Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversal of Medicaid cuts, while Republicans propose a temporary funding bill without these provisions. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is open to discussing subsidies later but rejects tying them to government funding. The House passed a stopgap plan with emergency security funding, but Democrats blocked it in the Senate. Another vote on the plan is expected Tuesday, just before the shutdown deadline.
