## Article summary
Moldova's pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) won a clear parliamentary majority in a weekend election, defeating pro-Russian groups. With nearly all votes counted, PAS secured 50.1% of the vote, while the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc received 24.2%. The election was seen as a choice between aligning with the European Union or Russia. PAS leader Igor Grosu described the election as a battle against enemies of the country, including Russian interference. Moldova, which applied to join the EU in 2022, has been a geopolitical battleground between Russia and Europe. President Maia Sandu is likely to nominate pro-Western Prime Minister Dorin Recean again. Recean emphasized the importance of unity and resisting Russian influence. Alleged Russian schemes included vote-buying, cyberattacks, and disinformation campaigns. PAS aims to continue Moldova's path toward EU membership by 2028, doubling incomes, modernizing infrastructure, and fighting corruption. The victory ensures continuity in Moldova's EU integration efforts despite Russia's attempts to sway the outcome.
