## Article summary
Congressional leaders from both parties are meeting with President Donald Trump to avert a government shutdown, but neither side has shown willingness to compromise. If funding legislation isn't passed by Tuesday, many government offices will close, and federal employees will be furloughed. Republicans challenge Democrats to vote against current funding levels, while Democrats demand legislation to extend health care benefits. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer emphasizes the need for serious negotiations. Trump has shown little interest in Democrats' health care demands but agreed to meet with Schumer and other leaders. The Trump administration pressures Democrats to back down, warning of potential layoffs. Democrats argue that Trump's agreement to meet indicates pressure to negotiate, but they must vote against a temporary funding bill to maintain leverage. The bill needs 60 senators' support, requiring at least eight Democrats to vote for it. Schumer faces criticism for his previous vote to advance a Republican-led funding bill. Democrats push for an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, while some Republicans seek reforms. The outcome of the White House meeting is uncertain, as past negotiations between Trump and Democrats have been contentious.
