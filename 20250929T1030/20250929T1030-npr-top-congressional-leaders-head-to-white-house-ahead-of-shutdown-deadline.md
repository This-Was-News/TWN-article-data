## Article summary
Top congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House to discuss government funding ahead of a September 30 deadline to avoid a shutdown. House Republicans passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21, but it failed in the Senate due to Democratic opposition. Democrats are pushing for permanent expanded tax cuts from the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of cuts to healthcare programs, while Republicans want to fund the government first and then negotiate on subsidies. The meeting follows President Trump's abrupt cancellation of a previous meeting with Democratic leaders. Without congressional action, government funding will expire at 12:01 am on October 1, potentially leading to delays in services and unpaid federal workers. The White House has instructed federal agencies to prepare for permanent layoffs, which Democrats have criticized as an intimidation tactic.
