## Article summary
A Michigan school district announced the closure of all its campuses on Monday following a deadly shooting and fire at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints service on Sunday. The attack, which left at least four dead and eight injured, was carried out by a 40-year-old suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, who rammed his vehicle into the church and opened fire with an assault rifle. Authorities believe Sanford also deliberately set the church on fire using gasoline and possibly planted explosive devices. The suspect was killed by police. Two additional bodies were later found at the church, bringing the death toll to four. One victim remains in critical condition, while seven are stable. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and former President Trump both responded to the attack, expressing condolences and offering support. The motive for the attack remains unknown, but investigators are searching the suspect's residence and cellphone records. This incident marks the second mass shooting in the U.S. in less than 24 hours.
