## Article summary
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building in Portland to oppose the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops. The protest included families and longtime demonstrators, with chants and drumming but minimal confrontation. Federal agents armed with long-barrel firearms patrolled from rooftops, and an armed escort moved through the crowd when vehicles passed. Later, several protesters were hit with pepper balls as ICE agents escorted a car into the building. Counterprotesters also attended, clashing verbally with demonstrators. One protest organizer, Dina, criticized Trump's deployment as a moral injury to veterans. The Trump administration justified the deployment to protect ICE personnel, while local leaders urged calm. Oregon's Democratic leadership opposed the decision, filing a federal lawsuit against the administration. Republicans, however, supported the move, citing concerns about crime and violence in Portland.
