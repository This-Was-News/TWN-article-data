## Article summary
Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican rapper and singer, will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. The announcement was made by the National Football League, Apple Music, and Roc Nation during the halftime of a game between the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys. Bad Bunny expressed his excitement, dedicating the performance to his people, culture, and history. Super Bowl 60 is scheduled for February 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, California. This announcement comes after Bad Bunny's successful residency in Puerto Rico, which attracted half a million fans. He is also set to host the season premiere of *Saturday Night Live*. The 31-year-old artist, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, revealed earlier in September that he avoided concert dates in the 50 U.S. states due to concerns about ICE immigration agents attending his shows.
