## Article summary
The federal government is facing a potential shutdown, which would furlough workers and disrupt operations. Essential services like law enforcement and airport security would continue, as would federal benefits such as Social Security and Medicare. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would initially remain unaffected, but payments could be delayed. Veterans would still receive medical care and pensions, though some services would be disrupted. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) might not accept new applicants. Environmental inspections and routine food safety checks could be halted. The Small Business Administration would likely stop approving new loans. Head Start programs might face delays if the shutdown extends into November. Airports would remain operational, but security disruptions could occur. Mail delivery would continue as usual. National parks might stay open but with reduced services, while Smithsonian museums could close after a short period. Passport services would likely continue if sufficient fees are available.
