## Article summary
Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to impact the southeastern U.S. this week, bringing heavy rainfall, flooding, and strong winds. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency in preparation. The storm, which intensified from a tropical depression, is currently affecting parts of the Caribbean and is forecasted to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday. Areas along the East Coast, including central Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, are preparing for harsh conditions. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warns of potential flooding and dangerous marine conditions. The region has been spared severe storms this year but has faced intense hurricane seasons in recent years, including Hurricane Helene last year. Climate change is making hurricanes more severe and frequent, with hotter ocean temperatures contributing to stronger storms. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 led to efforts to better understand and prepare for these storms.
