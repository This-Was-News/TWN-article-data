## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with President Donald Trump in Washington amid mounting pressure to end the war in Gaza. Israel faces increasing isolation internationally and internal political fragility. Trump, a steadfast supporter, may now pressure Netanyahu to wind down the conflict. Netanyahu's coalition members, however, want the war to continue, leaving him in a difficult position. Trump's recent actions suggest growing impatience, including opposing Israel's annexation of the West Bank. A proposed U.S. plan for Gaza includes a ceasefire, hostage release, and Hamas disarmament, but Hamas has rejected laying down arms. Netanyahu praised Trump's leadership but acknowledged Israel's loss of international support. The war has resulted in significant Palestinian casualties and displacement, with many countries calling for an immediate ceasefire. Ten Western countries recently recognized Palestinian statehood, and genocide allegations against Israel are being weighed by the U.N. Experts remain skeptical about an imminent end to the conflict.
