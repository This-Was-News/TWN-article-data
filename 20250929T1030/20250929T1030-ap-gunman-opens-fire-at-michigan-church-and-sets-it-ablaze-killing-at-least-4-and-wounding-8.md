An ex-Marine, Thomas Jacob Sanford, crashed a pickup into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Michigan, opened fire, and set the building ablaze during a Sunday service, killing at least four and wounding eight. The attack occurred around 10:25 a.m. with hundreds present. Sanford was fatally shot by police after a brief pursuit. Authorities are investigating the incident as targeted violence, with the FBI leading the probe. The church was engulfed in flames for hours, and searches for additional victims are ongoing. Bomb threats were made at other nearby churches, but no explosives were found. Sanford served in the Marines and was deployed to Iraq. The shooting is part of a broader trend of attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. President Trump praised the FBI's response and called for an end to violence. Local communities and leaders expressed shock and sorrow, with prayer services held for the victims.
