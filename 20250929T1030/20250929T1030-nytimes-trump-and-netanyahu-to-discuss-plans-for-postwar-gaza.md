## Article summary
President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet in Washington to discuss U.S.-backed plans for postwar Gaza, aiming to end the two-year-old conflict. This meeting follows a week where Israel faced increased international isolation, with several European countries recognizing a Palestinian state. Trump, a longtime supporter of Israel, has expressed impatience with the ongoing war and has warned against Israeli annexation of the West Bank. The Trump administration is considering various proposals for governing Gaza post-war, including one from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Netanyahu has indicated a willingness to work on Trump's proposal but has not finalized any agreement. The war, which began with a Hamas attack in October 2023, has resulted in significant casualties and displacement. Despite international efforts, negotiations have stalled, and Hamas has not yet received the latest cease-fire proposal. Netanyahu faces pressure from both international allies and his own far-right coalition, which seeks to control Gaza indefinitely. The outcome of the meeting could influence the direction of the conflict and potential political repercussions for Netanyahu.
