## Article summary
A daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris resulted in the theft of 'priceless' jewels, including the crown of Empress Eugénie. Four suspects, armed with chainsaws and box cutters, broke into the Galerie d'Apollon through a second-floor window and escaped on scooters. The robbery, lasting just seven minutes, involved a basket lift mounted on a truck. Two pieces of stolen jewelry were later found near the museum. French authorities described the operation as highly organized and mobilized central police units to track down the suspects. The Louvre was evacuated and closed to preserve evidence. This heist is part of a recent trend of robberies targeting French museums, including previous thefts of gold samples and porcelain works.
