## Article summary
An AP-NORC poll reveals growing concerns among Americans about their job prospects under President Donald Trump. Nearly half of U.S. adults express low confidence in finding a good job, up from 37% in October 2023. High costs for groceries, housing, health care, and electricity are major stressors. Trump's economic approval rating remains low, with only 36% of adults approving of his economic handling, despite a relatively solid economic backdrop. The job market has slowed significantly since the tariff announcements in April. Public skepticism about the economy's health persists, with 68% describing it as poor. Many Americans feel financially strained, with only 12% saying they are getting ahead. The poll highlights a sense of economic precarity, particularly among young adults who are less confident about buying a home. The survey was conducted from October 9-13, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.
