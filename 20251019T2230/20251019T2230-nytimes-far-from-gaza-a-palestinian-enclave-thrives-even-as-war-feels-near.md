## Article summary
The web page titled 'Far From Gaza, a Palestinian Enclave Thrives, Even as War Feels Near' explores the impact of the conflict in Gaza on the Palestinian community in Paterson, New Jersey. Paterson, located 15 miles west of Manhattan, is home to a large and thriving Palestinian community, particularly in the South Paterson neighborhood. Many residents have personal ties to Gaza and the West Bank, receiving frequent updates about the war through social media. The conflict has deeply affected the community, with some members returning from volunteering in Gaza hospitals and others struggling with mental health due to the constant exposure to violence. The community has also become more assertive in expressing its identity, renaming a section of Main Street as Palestine Way and flying Palestinian flags. This has attracted Middle Eastern tourists and increased local business. However, not all residents are united in their support for the Palestinian cause, with some feeling isolated or disillusioned by the community's focus on the conflict.
