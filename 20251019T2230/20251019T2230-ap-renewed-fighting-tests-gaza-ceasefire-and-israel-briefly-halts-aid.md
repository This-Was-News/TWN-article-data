## Article summary
A fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced a significant test as Israeli forces conducted deadly strikes, citing the killing of two soldiers by Hamas militants. The strikes resulted in at least 36 Palestinian deaths, including children, and led to a temporary halt in aid deliveries. Both sides accused each other of ceasefire violations, with Hamas claiming it had lost communication with units in Rafah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed strong action against any violations but did not threaten a return to war. Efforts to de-escalate the situation are underway, with round-the-clock contacts involving Egyptian officials. The conflict has resulted in over 68,000 Palestinian deaths and thousands missing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel and Hamas have exchanged hostages and prisoners, with ongoing negotiations focusing on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal, and future governance of Gaza. Hamas has stated it will not be part of the ruling authority in postwar Gaza and has called for the establishment of a body of Palestinian technocrats to manage daily affairs.
