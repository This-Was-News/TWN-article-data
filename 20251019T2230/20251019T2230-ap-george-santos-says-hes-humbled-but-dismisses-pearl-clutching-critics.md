## Article summary
Former U.S. Rep. George Santos, released from prison after serving 84 days of a 7-year sentence for fraud and identity theft, expressed humility but dismissed critics of President Trump's clemency. Santos, known for fabricating his background, apologized to his former constituents and acknowledged his chaotic state during his crimes. He compared his situation to other presidential pardons, including Joe Biden's pardon of his son, Hunter. Santos, who had agreed to pay restitution as part of his plea, indicated he would only repay campaign donors if legally required. He had appealed to Trump for help, citing his loyalty to the Republican Party, and learned of his commutation from fellow inmates. Santos' fabricated life story, including false claims about his education and career, emerged shortly after his election in 2022. He had previously made money selling personalized videos on Cameo and returned to the service after his release.
