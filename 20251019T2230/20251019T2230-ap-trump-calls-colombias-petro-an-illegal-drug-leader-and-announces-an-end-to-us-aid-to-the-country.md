## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the United States will end aid to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to combat drug production. Trump referred to Petro as an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened to shut down drug operations if Petro does not. Petro rejected the accusations, defending his anti-drug efforts and calling Trump's statements rude and ignorant. The Colombian Foreign Ministry saw Trump's remarks as a threat to national sovereignty. The U.S. has increased pressure in Latin America, with recent strikes on alleged drug traffickers, including one involving a Colombian vessel linked to the ELN rebel group. Petro has clashed with Trump over various issues, including U.S. military flights and strikes in the Caribbean. Despite tensions, Colombia plans to prosecute a survivor of a U.S. strike on a suspected drug-submersible. Analysts warn that cutting aid to Colombia could undermine its military and police capabilities amid a significant security crisis.
