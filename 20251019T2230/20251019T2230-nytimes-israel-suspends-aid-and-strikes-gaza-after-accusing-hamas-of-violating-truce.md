## Article summary
Israel launched its heaviest attacks on Gaza since a fragile cease-fire began, accusing Hamas of violating the truce by killing two soldiers. The Israeli military temporarily suspended humanitarian aid, citing the intensity of the strikes. Both sides have accused each other of breaching the truce, but both claim commitment to maintaining it. The flare-up of violence included significant strikes against Hamas targets and the dismantling of military structures. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the violence and ordered forceful action against militant targets. Hamas, meanwhile, sent a delegation to Cairo to discuss the cease-fire agreement. The cease-fire deal aimed to increase humanitarian aid, but the recent violence has tested its stability. The conflict has left Gaza's population displaced and suffering from widespread hunger. Hard-line members of Netanyahu's government called for a full resumption of the offensive against Hamas. The cease-fire deal includes the exchange of hostages and prisoners, with both sides facing challenges in fulfilling their commitments.
