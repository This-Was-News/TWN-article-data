## Article summary
A 155-millimeter shell fired during a live-fire demonstration for the 250th anniversary of the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton prematurely detonated, dropping shrapnel onto vehicles in Vice President JD Vance's protective detail. No officers were injured, but the incident occurred despite Governor Gavin Newsom's objections and closure of a 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5. The Marine Corps is investigating the incident, which involved firing artillery shells over the interstate, a decision described as unusual by military personnel. The exercise was part of a larger event attended by Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and it was terminated after the premature explosion. The Marine Corps had previously assured that the exercise would be safe and comply with standard protocols, but the incident raised concerns about the safety of such demonstrations near active freeways.
