## Article summary
The ongoing government shutdown has left U.S. Capitol Police officers unpaid, missing their first full paycheck on October 10th. These officers, who protect lawmakers daily, face increasing threats and violence, making their job increasingly difficult. Senator Katie Britt and Representative Joe Morelle have expressed concern for the officers, with Morelle noting the lack of negotiation to end the shutdown. The Trump administration has proposed repurposing funds to pay these officers, but Democrats have questioned the legality of this move. Additionally, officers felt disrespected when some GOP lawmakers did not oppose President Trump's pardons of January 6 rioters and a memorial plaque honoring officers who defended the Capitol remains uninstalled. Despite these challenges, the officers continue to perform their duties professionally, though each slight makes it harder for them to stay motivated. Recently, Rep. Nanette Barragán clashed with an officer, prompting the Capitol Police union to demand an apology.
