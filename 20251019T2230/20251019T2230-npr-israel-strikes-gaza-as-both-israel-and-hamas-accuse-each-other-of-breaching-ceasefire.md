## Article summary
Israel and Hamas accused each other of breaching a fragile ceasefire on Sunday. Israel launched strikes on Gaza, targeting Hamas infrastructure, in response to attacks on its troops. Hamas denied involvement and asserted its commitment to the ceasefire. The violence resulted in the deaths of two Israeli soldiers and a family of 11 in Gaza. The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S., includes the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Israel temporarily halted aid to Gaza but later resumed deliveries. The ceasefire has been violated multiple times since it took effect, with both sides accusing the other of breaches. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties on both sides, with over 68,000 Palestinians and 1,144 Israelis killed in the past two years.
