## Article summary
In a daring daylight heist, thieves stole priceless Napoleonic jewels from the Louvre Museum in just four minutes. The robbery occurred about 30 minutes after the museum opened, with visitors already present, highlighting security vulnerabilities. The thieves used a basket lift to access a window, smashed display cases, and fled on motorbikes. Eight valuable items were taken, including jewels linked to French queens and Empress Eugénie. The theft is one of the most high-profile museum heists in recent memory, occurring amidst complaints about crowding and thin staffing. The Louvre closed for the rest of the day for a forensic investigation, and security measures are set to be reinforced. The incident has sparked political criticism and raised questions about the museum's security protocols. The Louvre, known for its extensive collection including the Mona Lisa, faces ongoing challenges with mass tourism and staffing issues. The stolen jewels, described as of inestimable historical value, may be difficult to recover as professional thieves often alter them to evade detection.
