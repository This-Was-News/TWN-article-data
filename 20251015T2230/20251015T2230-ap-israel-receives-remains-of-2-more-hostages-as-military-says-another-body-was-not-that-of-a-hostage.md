## Article summary
Israel received the remains of two more hostages, adding to the tensions over the fragile truce with Hamas. The bodies were transferred by the Red Cross and sent to a forensic lab for identification. Meanwhile, Gaza received 45 more bodies of Palestinians from Israel, bringing the total to 90. The remains showed signs of mistreatment. Hamas had previously handed over four hostage bodies, following the release of 20 living hostages. Israel is awaiting the return of 28 hostage bodies. Forensic testing revealed that one body did not match any hostages. In exchange for hostages, Israel freed around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The ceasefire deal, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, aimed for the return of all hostages, living and dead. Hamas assured the U.S. it is working to return dead hostages, but the widespread destruction in Gaza complicates the retrieval. The deal's implementation remains fragile, with both sides accusing each other of not fully complying.
