## Article summary
The Trump administration has authorized the C.I.A. to conduct covert actions in Venezuela, intensifying its campaign against President Nicolás Maduro. This move follows weeks of U.S. military actions targeting drug boats off Venezuela's coast, resulting in 27 deaths. The U.S. aims to drive Maduro from power, with the C.I.A. now able to conduct lethal operations and a range of activities in the Caribbean. The U.S. military is also considering strikes inside Venezuela, with a significant troop presence in the region. The authorization, known as a presidential finding, was ordered by Trump after diplomatic talks with Maduro's government failed. The C.I.A. has a history of covert operations in Latin America, with mixed outcomes. The administration's strategy, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and C.I.A. Director John Ratcliffe, seeks to oust Maduro, who is accused of drug trafficking and ties to criminal gangs. The U.S. has offered a $50 million reward for Maduro's arrest and conviction.
