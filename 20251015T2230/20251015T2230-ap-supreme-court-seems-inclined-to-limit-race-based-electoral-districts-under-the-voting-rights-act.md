## Article summary
The Supreme Court appears poised to limit the use of race-based electoral districts under the Voting Rights Act, which could significantly impact voting rights and electoral outcomes, particularly in the South. During oral arguments, the court's conservative justices seemed inclined to strike down a Black majority congressional district in Louisiana, citing an over-reliance on race. This potential ruling could open the door for legislatures to redraw congressional maps, potentially eliminating majority Black and Latino districts that tend to favor Democrats. The court's liberal justices emphasized the historical role of the Voting Rights Act in combating discrimination. The case revolves around whether the creation of a second majority-minority congressional district in Louisiana violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. The Trump administration and Louisiana argue that the district should be invalidated, while civil rights advocates contend that the district is necessary to prevent discrimination. The court's decision could have far-reaching implications for redistricting and the political landscape. The case has been ongoing for three years, with the court expected to rule by early summer 2026. The outcome could lead to extreme gerrymandering and further erode protections for minority voters.
