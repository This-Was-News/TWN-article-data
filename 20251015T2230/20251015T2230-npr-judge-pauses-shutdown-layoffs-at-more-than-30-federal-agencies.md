## Article summary
A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily halted layoffs of federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown, citing the human cost and potential illegality of the Trump administration's actions. The lawsuit was brought by unions representing over 800,000 federal workers, arguing that the administration is using the shutdown to implement politically motivated layoffs. The judge granted a temporary restraining order to pause layoffs and block further notices. The Trump administration has defended its actions, claiming the layoffs are necessary due to the shutdown and targeting Democrat-sponsored programs. The judge expressed concern over the lack of consideration and potential errors in the layoff process. The unions argue that the administration is violating laws and congressional mandates. This is the second case involving mass layoffs that the judge has presided over this year. The Trump administration has appealed previous rulings, and the Supreme Court has allowed layoffs to resume while lower courts review their legality.
