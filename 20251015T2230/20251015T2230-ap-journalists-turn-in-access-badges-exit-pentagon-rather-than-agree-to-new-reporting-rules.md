## Article summary
Dozens of reporters left the Pentagon rather than agree to new government-imposed restrictions on their work, marking a significant shift in press access to the American military. The new rules, imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, would allow journalists to be expelled for reporting on unapproved information. Many reporters left together at a 4 p.m. deadline, carrying their belongings from suddenly abandoned workspaces. The move was seen as a demonstration against barriers to their work, though it is unclear what practical impact the new rules will have. News organizations vowed to continue robust coverage of the military despite the restrictions. President Donald Trump supported the new rules, calling the press disruptive and dishonest. Hegseth has previously restricted press access and launched investigations into leaks to the media. Journalists view the new rules as a distinction without a difference, effectively spoon-feeding information to them. Retired U.S. Army general Jack Keane criticized the new rules, emphasizing the importance of the media in a democracy. Reporters emphasized that they will continue their work despite the loss of Pentagon access. The Pentagon Press Association and various news outlets spoke out against the rules, with only One America News Network signing on.
