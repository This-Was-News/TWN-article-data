## Article summary
Folkston, a small town near the Florida-Georgia line, faces an economic dilemma with the expansion of the ICE detention facility run by The GEO Group. The facility, which will soon house up to 3,000 detainees, brings much-needed jobs to the impoverished area but also raises ethical concerns. The expansion is projected to create 400 additional jobs, offering higher wages than typical fast food or retail positions. However, the town's reliance on the facility is risky, as it depends on federal policies that could change. The GEO Group has been a significant contributor to the local economy, providing scholarships and funding for events, but critics argue that the benefits are outweighed by the moral costs. The facility has faced allegations of poor conditions and human rights abuses, despite receiving high ratings from ICE. Local activists and some residents oppose the expansion, citing the negative impact on the town's reputation and the ethical implications of profiting from detention. The county administrator acknowledges the risks but believes the economic opportunities are worth pursuing. The town's future hinges on balancing economic needs with moral concerns, as the facility's expansion could bring both prosperity and controversy.
