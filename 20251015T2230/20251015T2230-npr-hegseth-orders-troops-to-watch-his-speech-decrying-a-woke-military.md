## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered troops to watch or read his speech from September 30 at Quantico, Virginia, where he declared the end of a 'woke' military and criticized 'fat generals.' The speech, part of the 'Warrior Ethos Tasking,' includes plans to enhance physical fitness, grooming standards, and military readiness. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army National Guard veteran, spoke to hundreds of generals and admirals, stating the military has promoted leaders based on race, gender quotas, and 'historic firsts.' He announced the Defense Department would be renamed the Department of War, shifting to a more aggressive culture. The generals and admirals remained stoic during the speech, following instructions from Joint Chiefs Chairman General Dan Caine to maintain a nonpartisan stance.
