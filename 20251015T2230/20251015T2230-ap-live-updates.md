## Article summary
A federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's administration from firing workers during the government shutdown, citing politically motivated actions. The order came as federal agencies began issuing layoff notices to reduce the federal workforce, targeting programs favored by Democrats. The shutdown entered its third week, with the administration continuing to pay the military while slashing jobs in health and education. The judge criticized the administration's approach as reckless and harmful to workers. Meanwhile, the administration faced criticism for its handling of the shutdown, with lawmakers pushing back on plans to deny back pay to furloughed employees. Additionally, the administration's efforts to exert pressure on Democratic lawmakers through the shutdown were met with resistance from advocacy groups and affected workers.
