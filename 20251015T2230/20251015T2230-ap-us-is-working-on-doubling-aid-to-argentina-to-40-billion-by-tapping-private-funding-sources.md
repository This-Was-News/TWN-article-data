## Article summary
The Trump administration plans to double aid to Argentina to $40 billion by tapping private funding sources. This includes an additional $20 billion in financing from sovereign funds and the private sector, complementing a $20 billion credit swap line already pledged to Argentine President Javier Milei. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned that many banks and sovereign funds are interested in this private-sector solution. During a White House meeting, President Trump expressed support for the aid package but suggested it could be withdrawn if Milei's party loses the upcoming midterm elections. Trump's comments caused the Argentine peso to weaken slightly and sparked criticism from opposition figures in Argentina. Former President Cristina Fernández and other opposition leaders condemned Trump's remarks as interference in Argentina's elections and an act of extortion.
