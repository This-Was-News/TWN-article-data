## Article summary
President Trump offered a $20 billion bailout to Argentina's President Javier Milei amid an economic crisis, but with conditions tied to Milei's political success. Trump's comments were seen as interference in Argentina's elections, causing the peso to tumble and political backlash. Milei's opponents accused Trump of extortion, and investors panicked, selling off Argentine currency. The situation highlighted the risks of Milei's reliance on Trump's support. Milei has aligned himself closely with Trump, mirroring his policies and praising him frequently. The U.S. Treasury's intervention was unusual, aimed at stabilizing Argentina's economy and supporting Milei's reforms. However, Trump's conditional support backfired, potentially harming Milei's chances in upcoming elections. Argentines, wary of U.S. interference, may punish Milei at the polls, with over 60% viewing Trump negatively. Milei faces challenges in pushing through economic reforms amid political opposition and corruption scandals. The bailout has also sparked political blowback in the U.S., with Democrats criticizing Trump's priorities.
