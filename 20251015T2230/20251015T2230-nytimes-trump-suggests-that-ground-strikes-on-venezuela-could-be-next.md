## Article summary
President Trump suggested ground strikes on Venezuela could be next, while his administration withheld $40 million from California for not enforcing English proficiency among commercial vehicle drivers. Trump claimed he ended a war involving Pakistan and Iran with tariffs, though India denied U.S. involvement. Pentagon correspondents returned press passes due to new restrictions, with only One America News agreeing to them. Trump said India would stop buying oil from Russia and hinted at cutting federal aid to Democratic-led cities. He signed a memo expanding his authority to repurpose federal funds for military pay during the shutdown. Trump also threatened to punish Democrats and cut federal programs, discussed potential strikes on Venezuelan land, and warned Russia of costs if peace efforts with Ukraine faltered. Meanwhile, a federal judge temporarily blocked mass federal layoffs during the shutdown, and Los Angeles County declared a state of emergency over ICE raids.
