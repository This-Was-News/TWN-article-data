## Article summary
Charlie Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' marked its 85th anniversary in 2025, celebrating its bold stance against fascism. Released in 1940, the film was a significant risk for Chaplin, who financed it himself due to studio reluctance. Chaplin leveraged his resemblance to Adolf Hitler to parody the Nazi leader as Adenoid Hynkel. The film also featured a Jewish barber character who delivers a powerful speech advocating for unity and humanity. This speech was Chaplin's first on-screen dialogue and expressed his hope to contribute to ending the war. Despite criticism and political backlash, including accusations of Communist sympathies, the film's subversive message resonated. Science fiction author Ray Bradbury praised the film's use of comedy to challenge totalitarian regimes. Chaplin's speech concluded with a call for unity and peace, emphasizing the importance of humanity over tyranny. The film remains a testament to the power of art in standing against oppression, even 85 years later.
