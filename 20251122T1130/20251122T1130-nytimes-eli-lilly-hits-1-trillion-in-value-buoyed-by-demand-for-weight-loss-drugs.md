## Article summary
Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company behind the popular weight loss drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro, has achieved a market value of $1 trillion. This makes it the first company in the healthcare sector to reach this significant financial milestone. The company's stock has experienced a substantial surge, largely attributed to its success in the burgeoning market for GLP-1 weight loss medications. Eli Lilly's injection, marketed as Zepbound and Mounjaro, is projected to become the world's best-selling drug this year. This achievement places Eli Lilly among an elite group of publicly traded companies, primarily in the technology sector, that have reached the $1 trillion valuation. For comparison, Johnson & Johnson, the second most valuable healthcare company, is valued at approximately half a trillion dollars. Since Dave Ricks took over as chief executive in 2017, Eli Lilly has seen its market value increase by over $900 billion.
