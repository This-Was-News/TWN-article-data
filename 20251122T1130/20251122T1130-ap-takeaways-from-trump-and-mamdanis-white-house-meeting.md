## Article summary
President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, despite a history of public criticism towards each other, met at the White House and presented a united front, exchanging compliments and vowing cooperation. This meeting served the political interests of both men, with Trump neutralizing a potential Republican talking point against Mamdani and Mamdani gaining a potential ally in the White House. Trump publicly defended Mamdani against accusations of extremism, praising his rationality and shared focus on affordability, a key issue for Trump's administration. Mamdani, in turn, highlighted his focus on affordability as a shared concern with Trump. The meeting could provide Mamdani with a confidence boost and potentially ease his path in implementing his agenda by avoiding federal funding cuts or National Guard deployments. Both politicians, known for their plainspoken style, used the encounter to emphasize their shared love for New York City and their commitment to addressing economic concerns. While the detente may be temporary given their history and Trump's mercurial nature, the meeting marked a significant moment of apparent political accord between two prominent New York figures.
