## Article summary
The standard Medicare Part B premium, which covers outpatient services like doctor visits, is set to increase by 9.7 percent to $202.90 per month in 2026. This marks the first time the monthly premium will exceed $200 and represents a 66 percent rise over the past decade. The annual Part B deductible will also increase significantly. This rising cost is a key component of senior healthcare spending, as the premium is typically deducted from Social Security checks. The substantial Part B premium increase will consume a significant portion of the 2.8 percent Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), effectively reducing the COLA for many beneficiaries. For example, an average retired worker's effective COLA will be reduced to 1.9 percent. Medicare officials attribute the premium increase to the fast pace of national healthcare cost growth. However, a crackdown on expensive skin substitute bandages helped prevent an even larger potential premium jump. Medicare aims to cover approximately 25 percent of projected program costs through Part B premiums, meaning premiums rise in tandem with overall program spending.
