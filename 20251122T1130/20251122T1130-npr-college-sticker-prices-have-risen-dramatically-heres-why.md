## Article summary
The "sticker price" of college tuition has significantly increased over the past 30 years, with average tuition for both public and private four-year institutions essentially doubling after adjusting for inflation. While this trend is concerning, many families do not pay the full sticker price due to financial aid and merit-based scholarships. The net price, or the actual amount families pay, has remained relatively flat or even decreased in recent years for some institutions. Several factors contribute to the rising sticker prices, including declining state funding for public colleges, administrative bloat, and the increasing availability of student loans, which some experts believe colleges absorb through tuition hikes. Additionally, competition among institutions and the desire to build new facilities and hire more staff drive up costs. The opacity of the college pricing market also makes it difficult for families to compare costs and for colleges to compete on price. Some solutions being explored include standardizing financial aid offer letters and tuition freezes, with Purdue University serving as an example of a university that has successfully held tuition constant for over a decade by increasing enrollment and diversifying revenue streams. It's also important to note that significant variations in tuition exist across different institutions and states, with community colleges often providing a more affordable option.
