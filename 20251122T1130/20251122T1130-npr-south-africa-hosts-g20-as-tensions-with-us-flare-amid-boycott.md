## Article summary
South Africa is hosting the G20 Leaders' Summit, but the event is overshadowed by a boycott from the United States. The Trump administration cited "false race-based claims" and the summit's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) agenda as reasons for their absence, with Trump accusing South Africa of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaners. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has stated that the U.S.'s absence is "their loss." Argentina's President Javier Milei is also not attending in solidarity with Trump, while Chinese President Xi Jinping is not traveling internationally, and Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot attend due to an International Criminal Court warrant. This situation is seen by some as symbolic of a "fractured global moment." Tensions escalated when South Africa announced an eleventh-hour U.S. request to participate, which was met with an angry response from the White House. Domestically, Johannesburg residents have expressed discontent over the city's cleanup for the summit amidst ongoing infrastructure issues. Additionally, women's groups organized protests against gender-based violence, and debates have arisen over race relations in South Africa, reflected in billboard campaigns by different Afrikaner organizations.
