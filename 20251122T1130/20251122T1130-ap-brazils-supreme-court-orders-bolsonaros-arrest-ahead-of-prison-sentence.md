## Article summary
Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered the preemptive arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro. This decision comes just days before he was scheduled to begin a 27-year prison sentence for leading a coup attempt. The Supreme Court Justice, Alexandre de Moraes, mandated that the arrest be conducted with respect for Bolsonaro's dignity, avoiding handcuffs and public exposure. Bolsonaro's aide confirmed the arrest occurred early Saturday morning. The ruling cited a video posted by Bolsonaro's son, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, which Justice de Moraes deemed as inciting disrespect for democratic institutions. The video reportedly encouraged supporters to take to the streets in the former president's defense. Bolsonaro, who has been under house arrest since August, was taken to the federal police headquarters in Brasilia. His lawyers had previously requested he serve his sentence under house arrest due to health concerns. Bolsonaro and his allies were convicted for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democracy after his 2022 election loss. The coup plot allegedly included plans to assassinate President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and incite an insurrection. Bolsonaro was found guilty of leading an armed criminal organization and attempting to abolish democratic rule. He denies all wrongdoing and remains a significant political figure despite being ineligible to run for office until 2030.
