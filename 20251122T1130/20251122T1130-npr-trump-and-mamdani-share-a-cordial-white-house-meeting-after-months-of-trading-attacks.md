## Article summary
President Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a cordial meeting in the Oval Office, marking a significant shift from their previous exchange of political insults. Despite past criticisms, with Trump labeling Mamdani a "communist" and Mamdani calling Trump a "despot," the two leaders described their first in-person conversation as productive. Trump praised Mamdani's campaign and expressed a willingness to collaborate on issues such as the cost of living and crime reduction. Mamdani echoed this sentiment, stating his interest in working together to improve affordability for New Yorkers. Trump noted areas of agreement on reducing crime, increasing housing construction, and lowering rents, even while acknowledging potential differences in approach. The meeting also saw Trump defend Mamdani against conservative attacks and express confidence in his ability to lead New York City. Trump even lightheartedly dismissed Mamdani's past label of "fascist." While the long-term implications of this meeting remain uncertain, it suggests a temporary truce in their previously antagonistic relationship.
