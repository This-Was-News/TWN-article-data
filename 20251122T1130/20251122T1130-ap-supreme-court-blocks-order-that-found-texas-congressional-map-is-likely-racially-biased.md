## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted a lower court's decision that Texas's 2026 congressional redistricting plan, influenced by President Donald Trump, likely discriminates based on race. This order, issued by Justice Samuel Alito, will remain in effect while the court decides whether to allow the Republican-favored map to be used in upcoming midterm elections. The Supreme Court's conservative majority has previously blocked similar rulings that came too close to election dates. Texas had redrawn its congressional map to secure five additional House seats for Republicans, a move that a federal judge panel in El Paso found likely to violate civil rights laws. If the lower court's ruling stands, Texas might have to use its 2021 map for the elections. Texas was the first state to implement such changes, with other states like Missouri and North Carolina following suit. These redistricting efforts are part of a broader national debate, with legal challenges also pending in California, Missouri, and North Carolina. The Supreme Court is also reviewing a separate case from Louisiana that could further restrict race-based districts under the Voting Rights Act.
