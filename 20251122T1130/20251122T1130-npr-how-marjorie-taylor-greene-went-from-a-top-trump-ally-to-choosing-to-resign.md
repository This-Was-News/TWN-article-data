## Article summary
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch ally of President Trump, has announced her resignation from office, effective in January. This decision follows a significant rift with Trump, particularly concerning her push to release documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump publicly criticized Greene, calling her "Marjorie Traitor Greene," to which she responded by defending her actions as standing up for victims. The disagreement highlights a growing divergence between Greene and Trump, with Greene also criticizing Trump's policies on issues like the war in Gaza and healthcare subsidies. This shift has led some to question her political evolution, with observers debating whether it signifies a genuine change in her approach or a strategic move to broaden her appeal. Despite the national attention on their falling out, the impact on Greene's conservative Georgia district remains somewhat unclear, with local party officials noting that constituent concerns still center on issues like property taxes and healthcare costs. Greene's resignation adds another layer of uncertainty to the future of the Republican movement, particularly as the party navigates its identity beyond Donald Trump's influence.
