## Article summary
The Justice Department is under pressure to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein after President Donald Trump signed a measure passed by Congress. Republicans have long advocated for the release of these files, but the administration's efforts to suppress them have created a rift within Trump's political coalition. The issue gained significant traction when Democrats in Congress pushed for votes on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, eventually leading to its passage with broad bipartisan support. This marks a shift from the files being a fringe conspiracy theory to a significant political issue. While expectations for the files' content are high, fueled by years of speculation, federal officials have indicated that some rumored information, like a comprehensive client list, may not exist. The administration's previous reversal on releasing such a list has already caused outrage among some of Trump's supporters. The passage of the bill gives lawmakers leverage, and there are concerns about the extent of the Justice Department's compliance. Some, like Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, see the Epstein files issue as a broader movement representing a 'forgotten America' against an out-of-touch elite. Khanna hopes this fight can help Democrats reconnect with working-class voters and plans to collaborate with other lawmakers on similar causes.
