## Article summary
Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has announced her resignation from Congress, effective January 5, 2026. Her five-year tenure has been marked by controversy and a shift from being an outsider to a figure within the Republican party. Greene's political involvement began during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, where she initially spread conspiracy theories online, including claims about the 9/11 attacks and the Sandy Hook shooting. She was elected to Congress in 2020, having previously expressed sympathy for the QAnon conspiracy theory. Early in her term, the Democratic-led House removed her from committee assignments due to her rhetoric. However, she gained influence after Republicans took the House majority in 2022, becoming an advisor to then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Greene has frequently clashed with Democrats, including notable incidents during State of the Union speeches. Despite being a strong supporter of Donald Trump, their relationship soured. Greene began taking positions contrary to Trump's, criticizing Israel's actions in Gaza and supporting the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files. Trump eventually called her a traitor, leading to her announcement of resignation shortly after. Her departure marks the end of a tumultuous period in Congress for the Georgia Republican.
