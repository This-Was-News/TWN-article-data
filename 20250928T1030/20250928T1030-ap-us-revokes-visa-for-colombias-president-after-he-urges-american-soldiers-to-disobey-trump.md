## Article summary
The U.S. State Department revoked Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa following his participation in a New York protest where he urged American soldiers to disobey President Donald Trump's orders. Petro, who was in the U.S. for the U.N. General Assembly, made the remarks during a protest against the war in Gaza. The State Department cited Petro's actions as reckless and incendiary. Petro, Colombia's first leftist president, claimed international law grants him immunity to attend the U.N. and that his free speech should not be punished. He also mentioned his European citizenship, which allows him visa-free travel to the U.S. Colombia has been a key U.S. ally in Latin America, but tensions have risen under Petro's leadership, particularly over drug trafficking cooperation and recent U.S. strikes in the Caribbean. Petro has been vocal against Israel's actions in Gaza and has clashed with the Trump administration over deportation flights and anti-narcotics efforts. The U.S. recently accused Colombia of failing to cooperate on anti-narcotics efforts, a move that frustrated Petro, who highlighted the human cost of Colombia's efforts to stop drug trafficking.
