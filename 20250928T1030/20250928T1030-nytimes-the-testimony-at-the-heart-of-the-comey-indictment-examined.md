## Article summary
The indictment of former F.B.I. director James B. Comey centers on his 2020 testimony before a Senate committee. He is charged with one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional proceeding. The charges stem from Comey's testimony where he allegedly denied authorizing an anonymous source in news reports about an F.B.I. investigation, which the indictment claims is false. The obstruction charge is vague, asserting that Comey made false and misleading statements without providing details. The exchange in question involved Senator Ted Cruz, who misrepresented a 2017 hearing where Comey denied authorizing leaks. The indictment also touches on a 2016 leak involving former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew McCabe and disputes over the Clinton Foundation investigation. The charges are complicated by the five-year statute of limitations and the ambiguity of the exchanges. Prosecutors have also subpoenaed Daniel C. Richman, a friend of Comey, in connection with the investigation. The grand jury rejected a proposed charge related to Comey's memory of a report about Hillary Clinton's alleged approval of a plan concerning Trump. The indictment remains sparse, with many details left unclear.
