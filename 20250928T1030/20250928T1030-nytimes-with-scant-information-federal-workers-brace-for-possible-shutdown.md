## Article summary
Federal workers are facing uncertainty as a potential government shutdown looms, with the White House suggesting it could be used for further layoffs. With funding set to run out at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, employees are anxious about the lack of contingency plans from agencies and the threat of job losses. Around 300,000 federal employees are already set to be off the payroll by the end of the year, and those remaining may face unpaid leave or termination. Shutdowns typically disrupt government services and test economic stability, but this one could be worse due to increased uncertainty and threats from the administration. Experts warn that this shutdown could be more severe than previous ones, including the longest government shutdown during the first Trump administration.
