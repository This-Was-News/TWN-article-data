## Article summary
The Riyadh Comedy Festival, featuring prominent comedians like Dave Chappelle, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, and Jimmy Carr, has sparked criticism from Marc Maron, Shane Gillis, Stavros Halkias, and human rights groups. Marc Maron criticized colleagues performing at the festival, referencing Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Human Rights Watch condemned the event, urging comedians to advocate for detained dissidents. The U.S. State Department's 2024 report highlighted severe human rights violations in Saudi Arabia. Some comedians, like Tim Dillon, accepted invitations for financial reasons, but Dillon was later removed from the lineup after making controversial remarks about slavery in Saudi Arabia. The festival is part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiative to diversify its economy and enhance its cultural profile. Previous artists, including Mariah Carey and Justin Bieber, faced backlash for performing in Saudi Arabia. The festival's organizers describe it as the largest of its kind globally, aiming to position Riyadh as a cultural hub.
