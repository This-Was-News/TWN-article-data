## Article summary
Rudy Giuliani has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems over his false claims of election rigging in the 2020 election. The settlement terms are confidential, and both sides have agreed to dismiss the suit. Dominion sued Giuliani in 2021 for spreading baseless allegations that its voting systems were manipulated, which led to public distrust and threats against election officials. Giuliani's claims were part of a broader effort to challenge the election results, which Trump and his supporters falsely attributed to Dominion's voting machines. The lawsuit was one of several legal challenges Giuliani faced due to his role in promoting election conspiracy theories. Earlier, Fox News and Newsmax also settled with Dominion for their election-related claims. Giuliani has faced other legal and financial setbacks, including being ordered to pay legal fees and being disbarred in New York and Washington. He has also filed for bankruptcy and reached a settlement to retain his assets after being ordered to pay millions to defamed Georgia election workers.
