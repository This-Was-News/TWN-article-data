## Article summary
President Donald Trump's actions to tighten his grip on power and retaliate against enemies have drawn comparisons to authoritarian leaders in other countries. Since returning to office, Trump has moved rapidly to consolidate authority, steer federal law enforcement toward retribution, and purge disloyal officials. He has threatened to revoke television licenses, targeted political opponents, and deployed troops to Democratic-run cities. Experts note that while the U.S. still has robust opposition and checks on power, Trump's actions resemble those of leaders like Hugo Chávez, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Viktor Orbán. Trump has pardoned individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol attack, threatened judges, and targeted institutions he perceives as opposed to him. Comparisons to authoritarian regimes highlight concerns about the erosion of democratic norms, though the U.S. has not yet reached the extremes seen in other countries. Observers warn that Trump's rapid and overt actions could signal a dangerous shift, even if the U.S. has historical safeguards in place.
