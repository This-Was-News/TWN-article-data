## Article summary
Over a dozen FBI agents were fired, including those photographed kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington, D.C. The agents were sent by President Trump and then-Attorney General Bill Barr to deter protesters from vandalizing federal property. Some agents knelt to de-escalate tensions, but the move was criticized by many on the right. The FBI initially found no grounds for discipline, but a new investigation led to the firings. The FBI Agents Association condemned the firings, stating they violate due process and weaken the Bureau. The FBI declined to comment on personnel matters. Three former senior FBI agents sued the Bureau, alleging improper termination and political retaliation. The agents claimed current leadership was willing to violate the law to punish perceived enemies of former President Trump.
