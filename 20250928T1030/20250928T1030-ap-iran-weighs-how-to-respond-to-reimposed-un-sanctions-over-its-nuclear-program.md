## Article summary
Iran is considering its response to reimposed United Nations sanctions over its nuclear program, with one lawmaker suggesting parliament might discuss withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The sanctions, triggered by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, freeze Iranian assets, halt arms deals, and penalize missile program development. Iran's economy is already struggling, with the rial currency at a record low, increasing pressure on food prices. Concerns about potential conflicts with Israel and the U.S. are rising as missile sites struck in June appear to be rebuilt. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf warned of serious reciprocal action against any country honoring the sanctions. Iran maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60%, close to weapons-grade levels. The country argues that the European nations should not implement snapback, citing the U.S.'s unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear accord. Iranian officials downplay the impact of the sanctions, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praises the European nations' leadership. The future of diplomatic efforts remains uncertain, with risks of miscalculation and potential strikes by the U.S. or Israel due to the lack of IAEA inspections.
