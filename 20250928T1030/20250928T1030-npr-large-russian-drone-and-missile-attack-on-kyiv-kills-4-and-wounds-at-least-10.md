## Article summary
A large-scale Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions killed at least four people, including a 12-year-old girl, and wounded at least 40 across the country. The attack targeted civilian areas, residential buildings, infrastructure, a medical facility, and a kindergarten. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported damage at over 20 locations in the capital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that nearly 500 drones and over 40 missiles were used in the assault, which also hit regions like Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, and Odesa. Zelenskyy condemned the attack, linking it to Russia's stance at the UN General Assembly. Meanwhile, Poland deployed fighter jets in response to the strikes near its border. The attack followed Zelenskyy's announcement of a $90 billion weapons deal with the U.S. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 41 Ukrainian drones.
