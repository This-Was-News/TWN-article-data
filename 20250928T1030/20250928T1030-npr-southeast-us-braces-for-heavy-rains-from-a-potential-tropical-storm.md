## Article summary
The southeastern U.S. is preparing for a potential tropical storm, with South Carolina under a state of emergency. Tropical Depression 9 is expected to bring heavy rain, wind, and flooding. The storm is currently in the Caribbean and will affect Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Hispaniola before reaching the U.S. The National Hurricane Center warns of significant rainfall and possible hurricane-force winds. The region has been spared major storms this year but was hit hard by Hurricane Helene last year. Climate change is making hurricanes more severe, with hotter ocean temperatures fueling stronger storms. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 led to improved storm preparedness efforts. Other hurricanes, like Gabrielle and Humberto, are not currently threatening the U.S.
