## Article summary
Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight, killing at least four people and wounding at least 10 in Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl. The attack targeted civilian areas, residential buildings, and infrastructure, with thick black smoke rising from blasts near the city center. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down or jamming 566 drones and 45 missiles out of 595 drones and 48 missiles fired by Russia. The bombardment also targeted other regions, with at least 40 people wounded across the country, later rising to 70, and over a hundred civilian objects damaged. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported damage at more than 20 locations in the capital. The attack occurred as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke at the UN General Assembly, insisting Russia does not intend to attack Europe but will respond to any aggression. The assault triggered military responses in neighboring Poland, where fighter jets were deployed. The latest bombardment follows President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's announcement of a $90 billion weapons purchase package from the United States.
