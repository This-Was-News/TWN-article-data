## Article summary
President Donald Trump indicated the U.S. might resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time since 1992, stating it would be on par with Russia and China. This potential policy shift was announced on social media before a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. While the U.S. military tests missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads, it has not detonated the weapons themselves due to a test ban. Trump suggested the change was a response to other countries' testing programs, though specifics were unclear. He later told reporters that the U.S. would test if other nations were testing, and that test locations would be announced. Russia recently announced tests of new nuclear-capable weapons, and has revoked its ratification of a global nuclear test ban treaty. China's Foreign Ministry urged the U.S. to uphold its commitment to suspending nuclear testing. Despite his announcement, Trump also expressed a desire for denuclearization and de-escalation. Experts criticized the move, stating it would take years to resume testing and could trigger a dangerous chain reaction, potentially undermining the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki condemned the announcement.
