## Article summary
President Donald Trump described his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea as a significant success, announcing a reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods from 20% to 10%. This move, intended as punishment for China's role in fentanyl production, effectively lowers the total combined tariff rate on China from 57% to 47%. Trump expressed great optimism about the meeting, rating it a "12" on a scale of 0 to 10, and indicated plans for future visits between the two leaders and the potential for a trade deal soon. China's state media reported Xi's emphasis on cooperation and managing differences constructively. The meeting aimed to de-escalate trade tensions that have escalated since Trump's return to office, with both nations seeking dominance in manufacturing and emerging technologies. Despite Trump's confidence, experts suggest this is a short-term stabilization rather than a resolution of deeper rivalries. China's position as a top producer of rare earth minerals and the U.S.'s use of tariffs are key leverage points in their ongoing economic competition. The agreement includes China allowing the export of rare earth elements and beginning to purchase American soybeans, alongside discussions on advanced computer chip exports. This détente has provided some relief to investors and businesses affected by the trade friction.
