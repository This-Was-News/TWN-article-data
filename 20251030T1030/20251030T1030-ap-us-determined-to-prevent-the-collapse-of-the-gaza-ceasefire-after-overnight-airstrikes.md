## Article summary
The United States is actively working to prevent the collapse of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, following intense Israeli airstrikes that killed over 100 Palestinians. Despite the significant challenge posed by the bombardment, the ceasefire was restored by Wednesday morning. President Trump has asserted that while Israel has the right to retaliate against attacks, the U.S. expects the broader ceasefire, initiated on October 10th, to be maintained. The U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to the deal through high-level diplomatic visits and efforts to coordinate aid. Perceived violations of the truce have historically led to strong Israeli responses, with a history of lopsided death tolls in past conflicts. Israel maintains it targets only military objectives in accordance with international law, though human rights groups have accused them of disproportionate force. Deep mistrust persists between Israel and Hamas, with Israel holding Hamas responsible for all violence from Gaza, even when Hamas denies involvement. The current ceasefire is in its initial stages, focusing on the exchange of hostages and prisoners, with more complex phases like disarming Hamas and establishing a new government yet to be addressed. The return of incomplete hostage remains by Hamas has been a recent trigger for violence, highlighting the ongoing mistrust and the potential for further conflict.
