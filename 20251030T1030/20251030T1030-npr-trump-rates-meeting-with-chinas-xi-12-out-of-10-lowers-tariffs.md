## Article summary
President Trump described his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea as "outstanding" and rated it "12 out of 10." The two leaders met for nearly two hours and reportedly agreed on "almost everything." As a result of the meeting, Trump announced a reduction in tariffs on Chinese exports from 57% to 47%. This tariff reduction is linked to Xi's commitment to decrease the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. China has also agreed to resume purchasing soybeans from the U.S., a move expected to benefit American farmers. Additionally, China's restriction on rare earth minerals exports will be lifted for one year, and the U.S. will scale back some of its own export restrictions. Trump indicated that he plans to visit China in April for another meeting, with Xi reciprocating with a visit to the U.S. later. In their statements, both leaders emphasized the importance of partnership and friendship between the two nations, despite acknowledging occasional "frictions." While topics like the war in Ukraine and Taiwan were mentioned, others like a potential TikTok deal were not detailed. Trump also stated that China agreed to purchase American energy, potentially including oil and gas from Alaska.
