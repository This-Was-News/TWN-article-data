## Article summary
Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer and author of "Good Energy," is undergoing a confirmation hearing to become the next Surgeon General. In this role, the Surgeon General leads the U.S. Public Health Service and issues public health advisories. Means, nominated by the Trump administration, is 38 years old and a graduate of Stanford Medical School, though she did not complete her residency training. She has since focused on functional medicine, a field that emphasizes lifestyle changes and alternative approaches. Her confirmation hearing is unusual as she will be joining remotely, with her brother having previously shared she was pregnant. Senators are expected to question her qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. Means has committed to resigning from her continuous glucose monitor company and divesting from the supplement industry if confirmed. She has gained a public profile through social media and her book, often discussing chronic illness, the food supply, and environmental toxins. However, her nomination faces significant opposition from medical and public health experts due to her lack of traditional clinical experience and some of her views, including concerns about vaccine safety and hormonal birth control. Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams has criticized the potential confirmation, calling it a "disastrous precedent." Opposition has also surfaced from some of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s own supporters, who question her alignment with their movement's priorities.
