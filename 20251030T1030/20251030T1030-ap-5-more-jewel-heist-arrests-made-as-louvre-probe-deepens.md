## Article summary
Five additional individuals have been apprehended in connection with the Louvre crown-jewels heist, bringing the total number of arrests to seven. One of the newly detained suspects has been identified by DNA evidence as one of the individuals involved in the robbery. The theft, which occurred on October 19th, saw four individuals steal priceless jewelry valued at $102 million from the Apollo Gallery. The stolen items include historical pieces such as Napoleon Bonaparte's necklace for Empress Marie Louise and Empress Eugénie's pearl-and-diamond tiara. The heist exposed significant security vulnerabilities at the Louvre, prompting a national review of how France protects its cultural treasures. The initial alert to the police was reportedly given by a cyclist outside the museum, not by the museum's security systems. Two previously arrested men, aged 34 and 39, have been charged with theft and criminal conspiracy, and they have partially admitted their involvement. Investigators have found no evidence of insider assistance from Louvre staff thus far, but they are not ruling out a broader network. The thieves used a lift truck to access a window and fled on scooters after a swift, four-minute operation. The prosecutor has appealed for the return of the jewels, emphasizing their unsellable nature and the legal consequences of possessing stolen goods.
