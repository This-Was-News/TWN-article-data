## Article summary
President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have agreed to a one-year truce in their trade war, rolling back several contentious tariffs and retaliatory measures. China will suspend its limits on rare earth metal exports for a year, while the U.S. has halved its fentanyl-related tariffs. This agreement aims to de-escalate the economic feud between the two largest global economies. The truce extends a previous pause on additional tariffs, which was set to expire soon. President Trump announced the reduction in import duties on Chinese goods, citing China's commitment to stopping the flow of fentanyl precursors. China's official summary of the meeting was more measured, stating consensus was reached on resolving economic and trade issues. In a concession, Trump will postpone plans for steep fees on Chinese ships, and China will reciprocate. Despite these steps, underlying tensions remain unresolved, with the potential for future flare-ups. The meeting also saw China agree to resume large purchases of American soybeans. Discussions also touched upon semiconductors, with the possibility of allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, though no definitive update was given on TikTok.
