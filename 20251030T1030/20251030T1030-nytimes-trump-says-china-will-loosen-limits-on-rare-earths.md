## Article summary
President Trump announced a one-year truce in the trade war with China, agreeing to halve tariffs on Chinese goods and postpone new controls on rare earth metals. The announcement came after a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which also touched upon fentanyl trafficking and potential U.S. energy purchases from China. While Trump expressed optimism for a future trade deal, China's readout was more measured, emphasizing avoiding mutual retaliation. Separately, Trump announced the U.S. would resume nuclear weapons testing, though he suggested it was not related to China. The meeting also addressed the war in Ukraine, with both leaders agreeing to work towards a resolution. Trump also mentioned discussions about semiconductors and the potential for Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, with the U.S. acting as a referee. The fate of TikTok remained unclear, with both sides planning to "properly resolve" issues. The report also details the diplomatic efforts in culinary choices during Trump's Asia tour and highlights the upcoming Senate hearing for surgeon general nominee Dr. Casey Means, who advocates for functional medicine and has faced criticism for her views on conventional healthcare and vaccines.
