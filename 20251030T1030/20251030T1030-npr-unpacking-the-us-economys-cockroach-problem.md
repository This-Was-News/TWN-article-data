## Article summary
The U.S. economy is facing a growing issue with "private credit" firms, which are increasingly providing loans instead of traditional banks. This private credit market has experienced explosive growth over the last 15 years and is now valued at approximately $2 trillion. Natasha Sarin, president of the Yale Budget Lab and a former Biden administration official, has raised concerns about the risky nature of the loans being issued by these firms. Her worries are so significant that they bring to mind the 2008 financial crisis. The NPR podcast "Consider This" is exploring this "cockroach" problem in the U.S. economy. The episode is produced by Erika Ryan and Alejandra Marquez Janse, with audio engineering by Andie Huether and Josephine Nyounai. Editing was handled by Adam Raney and John Ketchum, and Sami Yenigun served as the executive producer. Those interested in sponsor-free episodes can sign up for "Consider This+" via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org. Listeners can also email the podcast at considerthis@npr.org.
