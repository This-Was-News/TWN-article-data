## Article summary
President Trump has been hinting at the possibility of a third term, a notion that legal experts and constitutional scholars state is impossible due to the 22nd Amendment. This amendment clearly states that no person shall be elected to the office of President more than twice. Despite this, Trump allies like Steve Bannon have publicly discussed a third term as a certainty, suggesting alternative "workarounds" within the Constitution. Trump himself has expressed a desire to serve a third term, stating he would "love to do it" and has kept the possibility open by not ruling it out. He has also joked about the prospect, even displaying "Trump 2028" merchandise during official meetings. While some interpret Trump's comments as trolling Democrats and delaying his status as a lame duck president, others view it as a symptom of an "authoritarian malaise" in the country. Experts emphasize that while attempts to circumvent the Constitution are "possible," they would fundamentally alter American democracy and lead the country into "real trouble." However, there is no legal path for Trump to serve a third term.
