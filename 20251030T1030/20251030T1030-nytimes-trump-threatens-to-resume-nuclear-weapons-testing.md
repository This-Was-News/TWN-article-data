## Article summary
President Trump threatened to resume nuclear weapons testing, marking the first such declaration in over 30 years. This announcement was made via social media just moments before a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump stated on Truth Social that he had instructed the Department of War to begin testing nuclear weapons on an equal basis due to other countries' testing programs. The phrase "on an equal basis" might imply testing unarmed missiles or nuclear assets, rather than actual weapon detonations, as the U.S. routinely tests missiles. China, despite rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996. Russia's last confirmed test was in 1990. While the U.S. has not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, past presidents have largely adhered to its provisions. The specific catalyst for Trump's announcement remains unclear, though it may have been prompted by recent Russian tests of advanced nuclear delivery systems. The statement was seemingly made while Trump was en route to meet President Xi.
