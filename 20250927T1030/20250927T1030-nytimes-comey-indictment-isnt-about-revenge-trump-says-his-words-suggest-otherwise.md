## Article summary
President Trump celebrated the indictment of former FBI Director James B. Comey, claiming it was about justice, not revenge. However, his actions suggest a retribution campaign against political opponents. Trump has accused Democrats of weaponizing the Justice Department against him and has directed the department to pursue his perceived enemies. The indictment of Comey, which Trump has targeted for nearly a decade, was narrowly approved by a grand jury. The Justice Department under Trump has abandoned principles of political independence, according to former officials. Trump has promised retribution and expects the Justice Department to punish his enemies. The department has also subpoenaed records related to Fani T. Willis, the Georgia district attorney who charged Trump. White House officials claim the president is focused on restoring integrity to the justice system. Trump allies acknowledge his personal feelings drive the Justice Department's actions. Trump has predicted more indictments and has targeted figures like Adam B. Schiff and Letitia James. The president denies having a list of targets but has expressed a desire to see investigations into his political opponents.
