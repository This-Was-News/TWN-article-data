## Article summary
NPR has filed a lawsuit to block the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) from awarding a $57.9 million grant to a new consortium for operating the public radio satellite system. This move comes amid tensions within public media as federal funding is set to end. NPR has managed the satellite system for over four decades, enabling hundreds of stations to share programming. The grant is separate from NPR's operational funding, which has been minimal compared to other public media entities. CPB initially promised NPR funding but later reversed its decision, citing a board-level decision. The new consortium, Public Media Infrastructure, includes several public media institutions. NPR argues that CPB's decision violates the First Amendment and the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. The lawsuit also follows President Trump's order to ban federal funding for NPR, which NPR claims is retaliatory. CPB maintains that its decision serves the best interests of public radio. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing on NPR's motion for a temporary restraining order.
