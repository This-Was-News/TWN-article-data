## Article summary
The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to allow the Trump administration to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress. The decision was made through the emergency docket, with the conservative justices siding with Trump's foreign policy authority. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, criticizing the rushed process. Earlier, a federal judge ordered the release of the funds, but the administration appealed. Trump also plans to use a pocket rescission to withhold an additional $4.9 billion in foreign aid, a rare authority not used since the 1970s. The pocket rescission targets funds for development assistance, the United Nations, and international peacekeeping operations. The administration's actions have been challenged by international aid groups, but the Supreme Court ruled they may lack standing to sue.
