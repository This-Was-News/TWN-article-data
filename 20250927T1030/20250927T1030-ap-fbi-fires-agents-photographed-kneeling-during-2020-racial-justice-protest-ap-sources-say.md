## Article summary
The FBI has fired agents who were photographed kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington following the death of George Floyd. The bureau had initially reassigned these agents but later terminated them, with roughly 20 employees affected. The photographs showed agents kneeling during protests, which some within the FBI found controversial but others saw as a de-escalation tactic. The FBI Agents Association condemned the firings, calling them unlawful and urging Congress to investigate. The firings are part of a broader personnel purge under FBI Director Kash Patel, who has been reshaping the agency. Recently, five agents and executives were summarily fired, including those involved in high-profile investigations like the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and Trump-related cases. A lawsuit filed by some of the fired agents alleges that Patel was pressured by the White House and Justice Department to remove agents who investigated Trump. Patel has denied taking orders from the White House regarding firings, stating that those terminated failed to meet FBI standards.
