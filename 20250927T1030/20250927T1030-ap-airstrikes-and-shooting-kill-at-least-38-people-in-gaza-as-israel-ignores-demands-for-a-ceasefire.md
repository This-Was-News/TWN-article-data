## Article summary
Israeli airstrikes and gunfire killed at least 38 people in Gaza, including members of the same family in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defiantly vowed to continue the war against Hamas during a U.N. General Assembly speech, despite international pressure for a ceasefire and growing recognition of Palestinian statehood. U.S. President Donald Trump indicated progress in negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release. Israel is conducting a major ground operation in Gaza City, where famine conditions persist, and hospitals are on the brink of collapse due to airstrikes and shortages. Aid groups like Doctors Without Borders have suspended operations due to escalating risks. Food shortages in northern Gaza have worsened as Israel restricts aid deliveries. The conflict has resulted in over 65,000 deaths and 167,000 injuries in Gaza, with women and children making up half the fatalities. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, with 48 still held in Gaza.
