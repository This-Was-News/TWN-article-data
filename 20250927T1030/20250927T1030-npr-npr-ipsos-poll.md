## Article summary
A new NPR-Ipsos poll reveals that while Americans are concerned about crime, they do not broadly support President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to police U.S. cities. The survey highlights a significant partisan divide over Trump's crime-fighting tactics, with Republicans largely supporting the deployments and Democrats opposing them. The ongoing presence of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. has drawn protests, and a federal judge has ruled the deployment of troops to Los Angeles illegal. Despite this, Trump plans to expand the practice to other cities like Memphis, Chicago, New Orleans, and Baltimore. The poll indicates that around seven in ten Americans believe crime and violence in cities are at an unacceptable level, although crime rates have decreased from pandemic-era highs. About half of those polled oppose deploying National Guard troops to their town or a major city in their state. The poll also shows that concern about political extremism and polarization has increased significantly since May, reflecting the public's unease with societal divides. Overall, the poll underscores a deep partisan divide in perceptions of crime and the appropriate measures to address it.
