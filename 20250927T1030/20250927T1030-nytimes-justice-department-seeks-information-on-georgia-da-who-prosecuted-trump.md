## Article summary
The Justice Department has subpoenaed records related to the travel history of Fani T. Willis, the Georgia district attorney who charged President Trump in an election interference case. The investigation's scope and target are unclear, but it involves travel abroad around the time of the 2024 election. Willis's office has no comment, and the U.S. attorney leading the inquiry has not commented either. Willis's case against Trump is in limbo after she was disqualified due to a personal relationship with her hired lawyer. Trump has criticized Willis and other prosecutors, predicting more indictments. The original indictment accused Trump and allies of orchestrating a criminal enterprise to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. Willis maintains she did nothing wrong and has paid for her share of trips with her lawyer. The U.S. attorney leading the inquiry is a longtime federal prosecutor whose appointment was recently made permanent.
