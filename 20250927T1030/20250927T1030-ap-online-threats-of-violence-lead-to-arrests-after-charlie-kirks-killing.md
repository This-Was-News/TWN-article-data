In Texas, a man faces federal charges for threatening to shoot up a Pride parade in revenge for Kirk's death. In El Paso, a woman is charged with arson after attempting to set a church on fire where a vigil for Kirk was planned. Similar arrests have occurred in Utah and Minnesota. Social media reactions to Kirk's death varied, with some mourning and others celebrating. Criminologist Alex del Carmen warns that the rise in threats is dangerous and self-defeating, emphasizing the importance of accountability and empathy. In Abilene, a man admitted to making threatening posts but denied any intent to act. In Minnesota, a man threatened violence against several people, referring to Kirk as his friend. Authorities in Minnesota and Utah have made arrests for terroristic threats, with officials vowing to hold those responsible accountable.
