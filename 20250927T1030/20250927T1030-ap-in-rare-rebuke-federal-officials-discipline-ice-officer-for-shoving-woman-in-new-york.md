## Article summary
A federal immigration officer was disciplined for shoving an Ecuadorian woman to the floor at a Manhattan court, a rare rebuke by the Department of Homeland Security. The incident, captured on video, occurred after the woman's husband was arrested at an immigration court in New York City. The footage shows the woman pleading with the officer in Spanish before he pushes her into a wall and onto the floor. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin condemned the officer's conduct, stating it was unacceptable and beneath the standards of ICE. The officer has been relieved of duties pending a full investigation. Such disciplinary actions are uncommon under the Trump administration. The altercation took place at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building housing an immigration court and a site of frequent arrests and detentions. DHS has defended its practice of having ICE officers arrest people at immigration court hearings, which have sometimes led to chaotic scenes.
