## Article summary
Michele Beckwith, the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento, was fired hours after she reminded Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino to follow a court order restricting immigration raids. Beckwith, a Democrat, had a 15-year career prosecuting serious crimes before her dismissal. She was replaced by a Republican, Kimberly Sanchez, and later by Eric Grant, a Trump loyalist. The firing followed a dispute over a court order prohibiting indiscriminate arrests. Beckwith argued that the Border Patrol was violating the Constitution, while Bovino claimed she was biased against law enforcement. The Supreme Court recently overturned a lower court's restrictions on immigration raids. Beckwith is appealing her termination, seeking reinstatement and back pay. She maintains her actions were motivated by justice, not politics. The firings highlight concerns about political interference in federal prosecutions. U.S. attorneys are expected to operate independently, but recent events suggest a shift towards political influence.
