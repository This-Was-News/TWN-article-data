## Article summary
China has vowed to stand firm against President Donald Trump's threat of imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, urging the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations. The Chinese Commerce Ministry stated that while they do not want a tariff war, they are not afraid of one. The threat comes in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are crucial for various consumer and military products. This escalation threatens to derail a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping and end a truce in the ongoing trade war. China has not backed down, relying on its economic strength. The U.S. has been accused of frequently resorting to high tariff threats, which China deems incorrect. China has warned that it will take corresponding measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues its practices. Trump has also threatened export controls on critical software. Both sides accuse each other of violating the spirit of the truce. China controls a significant portion of the world's rare earths mining and processing, making access to these minerals a key point of contention in trade talks. The export controls have affected manufacturers globally, including those in Europe and the U.S.
