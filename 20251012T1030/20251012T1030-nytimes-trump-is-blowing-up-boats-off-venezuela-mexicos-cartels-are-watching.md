## Article summary
President Trump's strikes on boats off Venezuela's coast, targeting alleged drug smugglers, have raised concerns about potential U.S. military action against Mexican cartels. Mexico, a major U.S. trading partner and home to powerful criminal groups, is closely monitoring the situation. Mexican officials and cartel members alike express confidence that U.S. intervention in Mexico is unlikely due to strong bilateral cooperation and Mexico's sovereignty. The Trump administration has emphasized collaboration with Mexico on security and migration issues, with both countries reaffirming their commitment to mutual respect and trust. Despite this, analysts caution that Mexico should not underestimate the unpredictability of the Trump administration. Public opinion in Mexico is divided, with a majority opposing U.S. military operations on Mexican soil, though some see U.S. intervention as a potential solution to cartel violence. The economic interdependence between the two nations, with nearly $1 trillion in annual trade, further complicates the scenario. The Mexican government has intensified efforts against cartels, leading to a decline in fentanyl seizures at the border. However, the ongoing conflict within Mexican cartels and the volatility of U.S. policy pose significant challenges.
