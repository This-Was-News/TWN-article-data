## Article summary
Preparations are underway to increase aid to Gaza following a new ceasefire deal aimed at ending a two-year war. Israel expects to allow 600 aid trucks daily, while Egypt is sending 400 trucks with supplies. The U.N. has aid ready for distribution once approved. The fate of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which replaced U.N. aid operations, is uncertain. Hostage releases and prisoner exchanges are planned, with U.S. President Trump expected to arrive in Israel. Health authorities in Gaza are preparing for returning prisoners and bodies. Palestinians are returning to devastated areas as Israeli forces withdraw. The war began with a Hamas attack in 2023, leading to significant casualties and destruction. The long-term fate of the ceasefire and Gaza's governance remains unresolved.
