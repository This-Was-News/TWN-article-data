## Article summary
President Trump issued a Columbus Day proclamation to 'reclaim' the explorer's legacy, emphasizing his 'extraordinary legacy of faith, courage, perseverance, and virtue.' The proclamation comes amid growing recognition of Indigenous Peoples Day, which acknowledges Native land and contributions. Critics argue that Columbus' arrival triggered mass genocide and exploitation of Indigenous people. The proclamation accuses 'left-wing arsonists' of trying to dishonor Columbus' memory. Columbus Day is one of 12 federally recognized holidays, with varying state recognitions. Columbus, born in Italy, sailed to the Americas in 1492, never reaching what is now the U.S. The holiday was first commemorated in 1892 to improve U.S.-Italy relations and became federal in 1934. Trump's proclamation was praised by some, including Italian-American politicians, but criticized by others for ignoring the darker aspects of Columbus' legacy. The president encouraged Americans to celebrate Columbus and display the U.S. flag. Indigenous people will continue to celebrate their heritage regardless of the holiday's name.
