## Article summary
President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to use all available funds to ensure U.S. troops are paid on October 15th despite the government shutdown, which is in its 11th day. This action aims to address the impending paycheck issue for 1.3 million active-duty service members but does not extend to furloughed federal workers or those being laid off. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown and asserted his authority as commander-in-chief to secure the troops' pay. The funds for this purpose may come from the Defense Department's research and development budget. While troops will eventually receive back pay, many military families live paycheck to paycheck, adding to their anxiety. Previous shutdowns saw Congress passing legislation to ensure troops' salaries, but such discussions have not materialized this time. The shutdown began on October 1st over disagreements about health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, with both sides entrenched in their positions, making the end of the shutdown uncertain.
