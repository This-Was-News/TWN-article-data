## Article summary
The article discusses the strained relationship between Israel and the United States due to the war in Gaza. Israels conduct has alienated a generation of U.S. voters, including American Jews and younger evangelical Christians. Polls show a shift in sympathy towards Palestinians, with many Americans accusing Israel of war crimes and genocide. This shift has led to increased pressure on Congress to curtail U.S. military aid to Israel. The article explores whether this damage is permanent or if Israel can repair its ties with the U.S. Some experts believe an end to the fighting could help reset Israels image, while others argue that the damage is irreversible. The article also highlights the deep strategic and economic ties between the two countries, which could serve as a foundation for continued cooperation. The outcome of Israels upcoming elections and the countrys political direction will also play a crucial role in repairing these ties. Overall, the stakes are high for Israel, as its dependence on U.S. support makes the battle for American public opinion a critical priority.
