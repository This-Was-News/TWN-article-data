## Article summary
Israel and Hamas have signed a cease-fire agreement to free the remaining hostages in Gaza, aiming to end two years of war that have caused significant casualties and destruction. The agreement is based on the first stage of a plan proposed by President Trump, but many details for postwar Gaza remain unresolved. The cease-fire is open-ended, and both sides have suspended military operations. Israel is expected to partially withdraw its forces from Gaza while remaining deployed. Hamas is to release 20 living hostages and the bodies of 28 others, while Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the bodies of 360 Palestinians. Aid restrictions are to be lifted, and the Rafah crossing with Egypt is to reopen to allow more relief supplies into Gaza. Key issues not covered by the current deal include Gaza governance, disarmament of Hamas, an international security mission, and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. These issues may become sticking points in future negotiations.
