## Article summary
General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, detailed a meticulously planned U.S. military operation, codenamed "Absolute Resolve," that successfully captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The operation, involving over 150 aircraft and months of intelligence gathering by agencies like the CIA and NSA, was executed in the early hours of January 2nd. Caine described the mission as discreet and precise, utilizing a full joint air operation with bombers and drones for cover during the extraction from Maduro's Caracas residence. President Trump suggested a blackout was triggered in Caracas to aid the operation, which lasted approximately 2.5 hours. U.S. forces extracted Maduro and his wife, with no U.S. personnel casualties, though one helicopter sustained damage. Trump praised the operation as an "attack for justice" and stated the U.S. will manage Venezuela until a "safe, proper, and judicious transition" can occur. The Maduro couple is being transported to New York to face U.S. charges, including narco-terrorism. The U.S. administration is justifying the attack based on Maduro's regime being illegitimate and its alleged role in funneling drugs and criminal gangs into the U.S., invoking Article II of the Constitution.
