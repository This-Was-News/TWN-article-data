## Article summary
The U.N. Security Council is holding an emergency meeting following U.S. military strikes in Venezuela and the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. The meeting was requested by Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who condemned the attack as an aggression against Venezuelan sovereignty and a violation of international law. China and Russia, allies of Venezuela and permanent members of the Security Council, backed Petro's plea. President Donald Trump authorized the strikes, which targeted Caracas and resulted in Maduro's capture. Maduro is now slated to face drug trafficking charges in New York. Trump announced that the U.S. will temporarily govern Venezuela during the transition period. The mission, which lasted less than an hour, involved seven blasts and no U.S. service member casualties. The Security Council's composition includes permanent members like the U.S., France, the UK, China, and Russia, along with ten non-permanent members.
