## Article summary
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, face new criminal charges in the United States, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and weapons charges. A federal indictment in New York alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders have used their positions to import tons of cocaine into the U.S., partnering with international drug trafficking organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel and Colombian narco-terrorist groups. The indictment details Maduro's alleged actions, including selling diplomatic passports to traffickers and facilitating the transport of drug proceeds. Prosecutors claim Maduro and Flores trafficked cocaine seized by Venezuelan law enforcement and used state-sponsored gangs to protect their operations, ordering violence against those who owed them money. These new charges build upon earlier indictments from March 2020, which Maduro had denied. The U.S. had previously increased the bounty for Maduro's arrest and designated the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. The International Criminal Court is also investigating the Venezuelan government for alleged human rights abuses.
