## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who are being taken to New York to face criminal charges for alleged international narco-trafficking. Trump stated that the U.S. intends to "run" Venezuela and that Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has been sworn in as president, though her whereabouts are unknown. The U.S. accuses Maduro of operating a criminal narco-trafficking organization and stealing U.S. oil. The strikes occurred in the early morning, hitting military targets and reportedly civilian neighborhoods, with Venezuela claiming casualties. The U.S. aims to have its oil companies invest in and operate Venezuela's oil reserves. Questions remain about the long-term leadership of Venezuela, with opposition leader María Corina Machado suggesting Edmundo Gonzalez should assume the presidency. International reactions are mixed, with some U.S. Democrats deeming the action illegal due to lack of Congressional authorization, while many Republicans praise it. Latin American leaders have expressed concern, though Argentina's president supports the operation. The European Union and the U.K. have called for restraint and respect for international law.
