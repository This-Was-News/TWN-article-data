## Article summary
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has been captured by U.S. forces and brought to New York to face drug charges. The operation, involving over 150 U.S. aircraft, resulted in at least 40 deaths. President Trump stated the U.S. would 'run' Venezuela until a transition of power. However, Maduro's aides, including Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, projected defiance, asserting Maduro remains the legitimate leader. The U.S. indictment charges Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and others with narco-terrorism and cocaine trafficking. Cilia Flores is described as a powerful political figure and the "power behind the throne" in Venezuela. Democrats criticized Trump's actions, linking them to domestic political motives and warning against foreign intervention. Air travel in the Caribbean was disrupted due to airspace closures. Delcy Rodríguez, despite Trump's claims of cooperation, defied him in a televised address, calling the U.S. action an "aggression" for "regime change" and resource seizure. The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting to discuss the U.S. strikes. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also voiced his opposition to the strikes and pursuit of regime change. The situation in Venezuela has led to panic buying and uncertainty among citizens.
