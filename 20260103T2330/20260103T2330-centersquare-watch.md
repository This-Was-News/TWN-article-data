## Article summary
President Trump announced that the U.S. will be running Venezuela for the foreseeable future following a military operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. Trump stated that U.S. oil companies will invest billions to repair Venezuela's oil infrastructure, ultimately benefiting both countries. He described Maduro as an illegitimate dictator and a drug kingpin, with Maduro and his wife to stand trial in the U.S. for alleged crimes. The operation, involving over 150 aircraft, was months in the making and executed after intelligence gathering on Maduro's life. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated warnings to adversaries and defended the decision not to notify Congress, framing it as a law enforcement function. Trump asserted that the U.S. takeover would make Venezuela rich, independent, and safe, while also bringing happiness to Venezuelans living in the United States. He claimed the operation would not cost American taxpayers, as oil companies would reimburse the U.S. The president also mentioned that the capture of Maduro makes the Western Hemisphere safer and that few U.S. troops would be needed on the ground for rebuilding efforts. Trump concluded by stating that Maduro did not come up in his last conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
