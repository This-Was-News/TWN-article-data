## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's head of military intelligence, as his new chief of staff. This significant personnel change occurs during a critical phase of Russia's nearly four-year invasion. Budanov, 39, has led the military intelligence agency (GUR) since 2020 and is known for his role in successful operations against Russian military assets. A career intelligence officer with battlefield experience, he rose through the ranks after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and participated in operations in eastern Ukraine. Since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Budanov has become a prominent figure, coordinating intelligence and sabotage operations that have targeted Russian capabilities deep within Russian territory and occupied areas of Ukraine. His public profile has made him a target, reportedly surviving multiple assassination attempts, and his wife was hospitalized with poisoning. Budanov's appointment signals a shift in government priorities towards foreign policy, defense, and security amidst ongoing peace efforts. He has previously engaged with both U.S. and Russian sides on issues like prisoner exchanges. In his first statement, Budanov expressed his honor and responsibility to focus on Ukraine's strategic security during this historic time.
