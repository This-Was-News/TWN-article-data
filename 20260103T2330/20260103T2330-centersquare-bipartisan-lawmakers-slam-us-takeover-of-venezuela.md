## Article summary
Bipartisan lawmakers have sharply criticized the United States' takeover of Venezuela following President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. will run the country during a transition period. This action followed U.S. strikes and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, who faces federal narco-terror charges. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost deemed the administration's actions unconstitutional, with Frost also criticizing immigration priorities. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene echoed these sentiments, calling for action against Mexican cartels and accusing Trump of attempting to seize Venezuelan oil and institute regime change. She expressed frustration over U.S. tax dollars funding foreign causes while Americans face rising costs. In contrast, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon supported Trump's actions, asserting that freedom and the rule of law were defended, but cautioned against dictators exploiting the situation. U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett also criticized the president, suggesting a disregard for Congress. The article notes Greene's upcoming resignation from Congress.
