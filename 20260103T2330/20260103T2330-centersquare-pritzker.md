## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that U.S. Armed Forces conducted a military operation to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are indicted for narcoterrorism. Trump stated Venezuela would be under U.S. control during a transition period and that the operation was successful with no U.S. casualties. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker criticized Trump's action as unconstitutional and putting troops in harm's way without a long-term strategy. U.S. Representative Mike Quigley also condemned the action as a violation of law, especially given Trump's previous rhetoric. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson linked the action to the dehumanization of migrants. Trump invoked the Monroe Doctrine, asserting the Western Hemisphere is safer, and claimed the operation would be funded by Venezuela's oil resources. He also mentioned assisting Chicago with crime reduction. Trump promised that partnering with the U.S. would benefit the people of Venezuela and those living in the United States.
