## Article summary
The Indicator from Planet Money is revisiting its coverage of Venezuela's economic decline, which began its freefall in 2024. The program has been consistently checking in with an economist based in Caracas to track the situation. This updated episode includes insights from their contact in Caracas, particularly in the context of recent events, including the U.S. deposing leader Nicolás Maduro. Previous related episodes have explored the causes of starvation in Venezuela and provided a day-in-the-life perspective from an economist in Caracas. The Indicator encourages listeners to send in questions about Venezuela for future episodes. The program is available on various platforms, with sponsor-free versions accessible through Planet Money+.
