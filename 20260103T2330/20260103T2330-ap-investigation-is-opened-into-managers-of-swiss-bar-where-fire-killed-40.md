## Article summary
Swiss authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the managers of the Le Constellation bar following a devastating New Year's Eve fire that killed 40 people and injured over 100. The managers are suspected of involuntary homicide, bodily harm, and causing a fire. Investigators believe the blaze was ignited by sparklers on Champagne bottles that came into contact with the bar's ceiling. The investigation will examine safety regulations, including the use of candles and the presence of sound-dampening materials, as well as fire safety measures like extinguishers and escape routes. Identifying the victims has been a slow and agonizing process due to the severity of the burns, with only four victims identified and returned to their families as of Saturday. Families are anxiously awaiting news, with some resorting to DNA samples for identification. The injured include nationals from Switzerland, France, Italy, Serbia, Bosnia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Portugal, and Poland. Mourners have gathered at makeshift memorials outside the bar to pay their respects. Officials have expressed determination to find answers for the affected families, acknowledging that the "world needs an answer" to prevent future tragedies.
