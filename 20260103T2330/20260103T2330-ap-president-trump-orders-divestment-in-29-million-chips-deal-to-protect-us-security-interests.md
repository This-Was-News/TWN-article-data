## Article summary
President Donald Trump has ordered the divestment of a $2.9 million computer chips deal, citing national security concerns. The deal involved Emcore Corp. selling its chip operations to HieFo Corp., a company allegedly owned by a citizen of the People's Republic of China. Trump's executive order demands HieFo divest the technology within 180 days. This transaction, initially announced in May 2024 during the Biden administration, involved Emcore's computer chips and wafer fabrication operations. The sale price was $2.92 million, including the assumption of approximately $1 million in liabilities. HieFo was founded by Dr. Genzao Zhang, who previously served as vice president of engineering at Emcore, and Harry Moore. Zhang had expressed intentions to continue developing innovative technology for artificial intelligence. Emcore, a public company at the time of the sale, was later taken private by Charlesbank Capital Partner. HieFo has not yet responded to requests for comment regarding Trump's order.
