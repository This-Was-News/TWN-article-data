## Article summary
The DOGE initiative, despite its leader Elon Musk's departure and mixed results, continues to influence the Trump administration's agenda in 2025. Musk, reflecting on his time, deemed DOGE's work "a little bit successful" in stopping wasteful funding but stated he wouldn't repeat the experience. Although many of DOGE's ambitious goals for efficiency and spending cuts did not fully materialize, the administration remains committed to reducing the federal bureaucracy. In terms of workforce reduction, while some agencies saw hiring increases, approximately 317,000 federal employees are projected to leave the government by year's end, with certain agencies like USAID and parts of the Education Department effectively eliminated. The administration also focused on slashing "Democrat priorities," cutting funding for grants in transportation and energy. DOGE's efforts to consolidate sensitive data have faced legal challenges but have been utilized for immigration enforcement, with some instances of misidentifying U.S. citizens. Government restructuring efforts persist, with Musk's allies transitioning into agencies and the creation of the National Design Studio to improve federal online systems. Despite these efforts, the national debt grew by over $2.2 trillion in 2025, and is projected to increase further due to new legislation. The administration maintains its pledge to cut government waste, though White House spokespeople did not directly address questions regarding deficit spending or the national debt increase. Key areas of federal spending like Social Security and Medicare remain untouched by DOGE's initiatives, as changes would require Congressional action.
