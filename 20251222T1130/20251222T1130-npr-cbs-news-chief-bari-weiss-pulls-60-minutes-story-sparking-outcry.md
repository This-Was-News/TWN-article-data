## Article summary
New CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss has reportedly pulled a "60 Minutes" investigative segment that focused on alleged abuses at an El Salvador detention center. The story, which was slated to air on a Sunday broadcast, was allegedly halted because a Trump administration official did not provide an on-the-record comment. The correspondent for the segment, Sharyn Alfonsi, expressed her belief that the decision was political rather than editorial. The "60 Minutes" press release had initially promoted the story, highlighting alleged brutal conditions at the CECOT prison. This segment had reportedly undergone multiple reviews by senior producers, executives, and legal and standards personnel. Alfonsi argued that government silence should not serve as a veto for reporting, effectively giving administrations a "kill switch" for inconvenient stories. A CBS spokesperson declined to comment, but noted the story would be aired at a later date. Weiss's appointment and her previous role at The Free Press have drawn scrutiny, particularly concerning her mandate for "balanced and fact-based" news and the new ownership's promises to be more hospitable to conservatives. Notably, Donald Trump had previously sued CBS over a "60 Minutes" interview and recently criticized the network's reporting. Weiss had also reportedly objected to the term "Venezuelan migrants" in the story, preferring "illegal immigrants."
