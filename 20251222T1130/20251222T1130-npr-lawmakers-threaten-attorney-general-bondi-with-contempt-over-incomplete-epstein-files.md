## Article summary
Two lawmakers, Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, are threatening the Department of Justice with inherent contempt, a seldom-used congressional sanction, over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. They argue that the released files contain too many redactions and missing information, failing to meet the requirements of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Inherent contempt, last used in the 1930s, could result in fines for Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Justice Department, however, defends its partial release, stating it complies with the law and that hundreds of lawyers are reviewing remaining documents to protect victims' information. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche dismissed the contempt threats, asserting lawmakers misunderstand the situation. A photograph of President Trump among other photos was initially removed from the released files but later reposted after review determined no victims were depicted. The department explained that photos are removed if victims' rights groups raise concerns, as per a judge's order. Additionally, a previously redacted transcript of grand jury proceedings related to Ghislaine Maxwell has been re-uploaded with minimal redactions, indicating ongoing efforts to comply with legal and victim protection requirements.
