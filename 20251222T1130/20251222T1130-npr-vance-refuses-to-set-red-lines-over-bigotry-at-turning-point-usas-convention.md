## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance stated at Turning Point USA's convention that the conservative movement should embrace all who "love America," refusing to set specific boundaries or condemn controversial figures. This stance comes amidst internal Republican debates about antisemitism and the movement's future direction without Donald Trump. Vance emphasized inclusivity, suggesting that "purity tests" are counterproductive and that the focus should be on shared patriotism rather than ideological conformity. The convention highlighted divisions within the "Make America Great Again" movement, with figures like Ben Shapiro denouncing those who traffic in "conspiracism and dishonesty," while others, like Tucker Carlson, downplayed the idea of a Republican "civil war." Turning Point USA, now led by Erika Kirk following her husband Charlie Kirk's assassination, has endorsed Vance, recognizing his influence and potential role in shaping the post-Trump GOP. Vance also asserted that the U.S. is and "always will be a Christian nation," a statement that resonated with some young attendees. Despite the internal disagreements, Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet framed the discord as a healthy debate necessary for finding consensus. The event also saw a surprise appearance by rapper Nicki Minaj, who spoke positively about both Trump and Vance. The discussions at the convention underscore the challenges any potential Republican presidential nominee will face in unifying the party's diverse factions.
