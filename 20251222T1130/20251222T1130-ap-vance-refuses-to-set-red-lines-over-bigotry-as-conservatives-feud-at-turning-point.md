## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance stated that the conservative movement should be inclusive as long as individuals love America, choosing not to condemn antisemitism that has caused division within the Republican Party at Turning Point USA's annual convention. Vance emphasized that he did not bring a list of conservatives to denounce, advocating against purity tests within the movement. The convention highlighted the internal conflicts and jockeying for influence among leading conservative figures as they contemplate a future beyond Donald Trump's presidency. Debates at the event touched upon antisemitism, Israel, and environmental regulations, with speakers like Ben Shapiro criticizing those who traffic in conspiracism. Tucker Carlson, however, dismissed the idea of a Republican civil war, framing Vance as a proponent of the "America First" ideology. Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet described the discord as a healthy debate about the movement's future. Vance, endorsed by Turning Point leader Erika Kirk, reiterated that anyone who loves America is welcome, regardless of background. He also asserted that the U.S. is and always will be a Christian nation. Turning Point USA has expressed strong support for Vance, potentially aiding him in future political endeavors. Rapper Nicki Minaj also made a surprise appearance, praising both Trump and Vance. The article notes that Trump has spoken highly of Vance as a potential successor.
