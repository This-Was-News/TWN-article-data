## Article summary
CBS News abruptly pulled a segment from 60 Minutes just hours before its scheduled broadcast, a decision that has sparked controversy and accusations of political interference. The segment was to feature the stories of Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador, which the program described as brutal. Veteran correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who reported the story, stated in a private note that the segment had undergone multiple screenings and was cleared by legal and standards departments, asserting that its removal was a political decision rather than an editorial one. New CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss requested significant changes and additional reporting, citing her role in ensuring stories are the best they can be. This incident places 60 Minutes at the center of a media and political debate, particularly given recent events involving the acquisition of CBS's parent company by David Ellison, who is seeking support for a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery and has faced criticism from former President Trump regarding 60 Minutes' coverage. Alfonsi argued that the segment's removal, after extensive internal checks and promotion, amounted to corporate censorship and handed the Trump administration a "kill switch" for inconvenient reporting. She expressed concern about damaging the broadcast's reputation for the sake of political quiet. Weiss maintained that the story would air when it was ready, emphasizing the importance of thoroughness and context in news reporting.
