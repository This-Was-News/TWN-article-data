## Article summary
An NPR analysis reveals a significant increase in immigrants not appearing for their mandatory immigration court hearings, leading to immediate deportation orders. This trend, observed nationwide, is attributed by immigration attorneys to a spreading fear that attending court could result in arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In 2025, ICE intensified arrests directly from courtrooms to meet quotas, a strategy that has instilled fear and hesitancy in immigrants. The number of 'in absentia' removal orders, where deportation is ordered due to a missed hearing, nearly tripled in fiscal year 2025 compared to the previous year, exceeding 50,000. This rise began in the summer months, coinciding with increased ICE arrests inside courts. Attorneys report that immigrants may miss hearings due to lost mail, incorrect addresses, or fear of detention and deportation to third countries. Logistical issues like changing hearing dates without proper notification also contribute. While the number of in absentia removals has been gradually increasing since 2022, the current surge is described as well beyond historical trends. Many immigrants lack legal representation, making it difficult to reopen cases after an order of removal. Advocates suggest this rise aligns with a narrative portraying immigrants as non-participants in the legal process, despite many still attending hearings amidst numerous stacked against them.
