## Article summary
A 13-year-old girl in Louisiana was expelled from middle school after getting into a fight with a classmate who was sharing AI-generated nude images of her. The images, created by artificial intelligence, were circulating among students, and the girl's initial attempts to seek help from school staff were unsuccessful. The situation escalated when she saw the images being shared on a school bus, leading her to physically assault the boy. While the sheriff's department eventually charged two boys with unlawful dissemination of AI-generated images, the girl faced expulsion. Her attorneys argued she was a victim, but school officials maintained that students can be both victims and perpetrators. The girl's expulsion led to significant emotional distress and academic setbacks. After an appeal, the school board allowed her to return to her original school on probation, but she missed out on extracurricular activities like basketball tryouts. This incident highlights the growing problem of deepfake cyberbullying and the challenges schools face in addressing new technologies and their misuse.
