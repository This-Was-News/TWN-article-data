## Article summary
Australian police allege that the suspect in the Bondi Beach shooting, Naveed Akram, conducted firearms training with his father, Sajid Akram. The 24-year-old Akram is accused of killing 15 people in an attack on an annual Jewish event on December 14. Police documents reveal that the father and son recorded a video justifying their planned attack, which involved throwing improvised explosive devices that failed to detonate. Naveed Akram has been charged with 15 counts of murder and other offenses, including committing a terrorist act. This incident marks Australia's deadliest mass shooting since 1996. In response, New South Wales is proposing stricter firearms laws, including making Australian citizenship a requirement for a firearms license. Evidence suggests the attack was meticulously planned for months, with the perpetrators expressing antisemitic views and adherence to an ideology linked to the Islamic State. The impromptu memorial at Bondi Beach has been dismantled, with parts to be preserved by the Sydney Jewish Museum. Funerals for the victims are ongoing, and several injured individuals remain hospitalized.
