## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has paused immigration applications from an additional 20 countries, primarily from Africa, as part of an expansion of travel restrictions that took effect on January 1. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will halt the review of all pending applications for visas, green cards, citizenship, or asylum from immigrants in these countries and plans to re-review applications dating back to 2021. The DHS stated this action is to ensure that individuals from high-risk countries do not pose a threat to national security or public safety, citing high overstay rates and significant fraud as reasons. The expanded list now includes 39 countries plus the Palestinian Authority. This move follows an incident where an Afghan national was arrested in connection with the shooting of two National Guard troops. USCIS had previously announced an indefinite pause on asylum application processing and began re-reviewing the status of refugees admitted under the Biden administration. Exceptions to the pause include athletes participating in the World Cup and Olympics.
