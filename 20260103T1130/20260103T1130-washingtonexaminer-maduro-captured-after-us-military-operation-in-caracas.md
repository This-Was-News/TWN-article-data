## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. military, in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement, has captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife following a special forces operation in Caracas. Trump described the operation as "brilliant" and stated that Maduro has been "captured and flown out of the Country." If confirmed, this would be an unprecedented event in modern history, marking the first time a head of state has been taken captive by a rival nation in a special forces operation. CBS officials reported that Delta Force, the Army's elite unit, carried out the mission. The Venezuelan government has not yet officially acknowledged Maduro's abduction. In a national address, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez denounced the U.S. operation as an "invasion" but did not address Maduro's status. According to Venezuela's constitution, power should pass to Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, though she faces significant legitimacy challenges. Trump is scheduled to hold a news conference to address further details and next steps for Venezuela. This event follows Trump's long-standing pressure on Maduro, including a $50 million bounty and accusations of corruption and drug trafficking. The operation, which reportedly lasted about an hour with explosions heard from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. local time, involved helicopters and special forces. The U.S. previously attempted a similar operation in 1989 to capture Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
