## Article summary
President Donald Trump vetoed the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, a bill intended to provide a 100-year, no-interest repayment plan for Colorado communities working on the Arkansas Valley Conduit water pipeline. This bipartisan bill, introduced by Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, aimed to ease the financial burden on local municipalities for a project authorized in 1962. Trump stated his veto was to protect taxpayer money from funding special interests and to restore fiscal sanity. Boebert criticized the veto, calling it "completely non-controversial" and questioning the "America First" stance when denying clean water to 50,000 people. She suggested the veto might be political retaliation and vowed to fight the decision. The Arkansas Valley Conduit project, estimated to cost over $1.3 billion, has faced decades of delays due to repayment issues. Previous legislation in 2009 extended the repayment period to 75 years and reduced the repayment amount. Despite the veto, the project is expected to proceed, with municipalities remaining on the 75-year repayment schedule with interest. Congress has the ability to override the veto with a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate.
