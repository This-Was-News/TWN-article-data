## Article summary
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled against California's ban on the open carry of firearms in most of the state's counties, specifically those with populations exceeding 200,000. The court determined that this ban infringes upon the Second Amendment's right to bear arms, as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision stems from a lawsuit filed by gun owner Mark Baird against California Attorney General Rob Bonta. The ruling partially overturned a previous decision by a district court judge. The panel of three judges applied the standard set by a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, noting that open carry has historical precedent. California was found to have not provided sufficient evidence of a historical tradition of firearm regulation that would justify the ban in urban areas. However, the court affirmed the lower court's rejection of challenges related to open-carry licensing in counties with fewer than 200,000 people, as the plaintiff had waived that specific argument. One judge partially dissented, believing the restrictions in more populous counties were constitutional. The California Attorney General's office stated they are reviewing the opinion and considering their options.
