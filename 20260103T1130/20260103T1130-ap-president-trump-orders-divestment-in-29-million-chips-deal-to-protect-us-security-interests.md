## Article summary
President Donald Trump has ordered the divestment of a $2.9 million computer chips deal, citing threats to U.S. security interests. The deal, initially approved during the Biden administration, involved Emcore Corp. selling its chip operations to HieFo Corp. for $2.92 million. Trump's executive order demands HieFo divest the technology within 180 days, based on evidence that its current owner is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. HieFo was founded by Dr. Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore, with Zhang, formerly of Emcore, set to oversee the technology's development for purposes including artificial intelligence. The company has not yet responded to requests for comment on the order. Emcore was taken private by Charlesbank Capital Partner last year.
