## Article summary
President Trump announced on his social media platform that the United States has captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, stating they are being flown out of the country. This announcement followed reports of large explosions at a military base in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, which the Venezuelan government accused the U.S. of carrying out. The Venezuelan vice president has requested proof of life for Maduro, whose whereabouts are reportedly unknown. Trump described the capture as a "brilliant operation" and stated he would address further details at a news conference. For months, the Trump administration has intensified efforts to oust Maduro, labeling him a narco-terrorist and accusing him of controlling criminal groups. The U.S. military has amassed troops and conducted strikes against suspected drug-smuggling vessels and oil tankers near Venezuela. Legal experts have questioned the legality of these strikes, as Congress has not authorized them. Maduro himself had reportedly tightened his security measures, including changing sleeping locations, to protect against potential U.S. actions. While some international leaders have celebrated Maduro's capture, others, like Cuba's president, have denounced the U.S. actions. The situation in Venezuela remains uncertain, with questions about who would assume leadership if Maduro is indeed in U.S. custody.
