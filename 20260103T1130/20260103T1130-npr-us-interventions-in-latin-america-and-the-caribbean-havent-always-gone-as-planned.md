## Article summary
U.S. interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean, stemming from the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and evolving through the 20th century to counter communism and protect U.S. interests, have a long and complex history. President Theodore Roosevelt expanded the Monroe Doctrine to assert a U.S. right to act as a regional policeman. Following World War II, the focus shifted to preventing the spread of communism, often through covert operations, which became more overt in the 1980s during the Cold War. By the mid-1980s, U.S. policy transitioned to the "drug war" in the region. These interventions, both overt and covert, have frequently resulted in unintended consequences. Examples include the 1954 overthrow of Guatemala's democratically elected government, which led to a series of brutal U.S.-backed authoritarians and emboldened illiberal forces. The 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba was a disaster that embarrassed the U.S. and precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis. The 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada, aimed at ousting a socialist government aligned with Cuba, resulted in stable democratic governance. U.S. support for the Nicaraguan Contras in the 1980s, despite congressional restrictions and the Iran-Contra affair, ultimately failed to dislodge the Sandinistas, and Daniel Ortega, once a Marxist, now leads a family dictatorship. The 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama to oust Manuel Noriega, who had become a liability due to drug trafficking, is considered a rare example of a successful intervention, leading to stable democracy and economic growth, though some argue the positive outcomes are not solely attributable to the invasion.
