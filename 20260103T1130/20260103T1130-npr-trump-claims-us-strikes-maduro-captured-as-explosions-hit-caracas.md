## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that the United States conducted airstrikes in Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife early on January 3, 2026. He stated the operation was a "large-scale strike" and that Maduro and his wife were "flown out of the country." Trump also announced a press conference at Mar-a-Lago for later that morning. The Venezuelan government responded by accusing the U.S. of "grave military aggression" and a "flagrant violation" of the United Nations Charter, claiming U.S. forces targeted civilian and military locations. Reports of explosions and fires emerged from Caracas around 2 a.m. local time, with witnesses describing blasts near military airports and other parts of the city. Videos, though not independently verified by NPR, appeared to show multiple explosions across the metropolitan area, including near the presidential palace. These events follow increased U.S. pressure on Maduro's government, which the Trump administration has accused of drug trafficking. The U.S. has recently deployed naval forces to the Caribbean, conducting strikes on vessels it claimed were transporting drugs. Maduro has previously accused Washington of seeking to control Venezuela's oil reserves. Regional reactions varied, with Cuba denouncing the alleged attack while Argentina's President Javier Milei praised it.
