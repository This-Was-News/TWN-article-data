## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani began his first full day as New York City mayor with a subway commute from his Queens apartment, a move mirroring past mayors aiming for relatability. His inauguration was hailed as a significant moment for the progressive movement. Early in his term, Mamdani pledged to ramp up legal action against negligent landlords, focusing on affordable housing. However, his administration faced immediate scrutiny and backlash from some Jewish groups after he revoked executive orders issued by his predecessor, Eric Adams. These revoked orders included a contentious definition of antisemitism and a ban on boycotting or divesting from Israel. The Israeli government accused Mamdani of fueling antisemitism, while Mamdani stated his administration would be relentless in combating hate and division, while maintaining the Mayors Office to Combat Antisemitism. He also announced the creation of a mass engagement office to involve more New Yorkers in politics. Mamdani acknowledged the significance of the moment, emphasizing that New Yorkers are once again believing in city government, which requires action to sustain. He also plans to move to the mayor's official residence.
