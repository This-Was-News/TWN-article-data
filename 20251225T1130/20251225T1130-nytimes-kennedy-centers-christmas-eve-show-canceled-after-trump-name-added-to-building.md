## Article summary
The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has canceled its annual Christmas Eve jazz concert. Musician Chuck Redd, who hosted the show for nearly a decade, decided to call off the performance after learning that President Trump's name was added to the building. The center's board, chaired by Mr. Trump, announced the renaming to the Trump Kennedy Center. This move followed the Trump administration's replacement of board members appointed by President Biden with individuals handpicked by Mr. Trump. The renaming has faced opposition, with Representative Joyce Beatty suing to block the change, arguing that an act of Congress is required. Relatives of President John F. Kennedy also expressed their opposition on social media. The concert had been a 20-year tradition at the Kennedy Center, previously hosted by jazz bassist Keter Betts before Mr. Redd took over in 2006. The Kennedy Center has not yet commented on the cancellation or potential refunds for ticket holders.
