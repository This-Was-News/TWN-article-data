## Article summary
An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, Victor Mojica, was placed on administrative leave after being captured on video roughly pushing a woman at an immigration court in New York. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initially stated his behavior was unacceptable. However, Mojica was reinstated to his job within days, before the DHS Office of Inspector General had concluded its review. The Inspector General's office ultimately decided not to pursue a criminal probe nearly two months later. This rapid reinstatement and lack of transparency have raised concerns about the adequacy of DHS oversight mechanisms for investigating employee misconduct. Critics and former ICE personnel worry that the politicization of law enforcement and the pressure to increase deportations may exacerbate systemic issues. DHS has not provided further explanation for Mojica's reinstatement, citing personnel privacy. A congressman who inquired about the investigation found the response unsatisfactory, stating it raised more questions than it answered. Experts suggest that rapid hiring and pressure to detain more immigrants could contribute to misconduct, echoing concerns from past expansions of border patrol. The lack of public explanation for Mojica's return, especially after a public denouncement, has led some to believe ICE is losing its professionalism.
