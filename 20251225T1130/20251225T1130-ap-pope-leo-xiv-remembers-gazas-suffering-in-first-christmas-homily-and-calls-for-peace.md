## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV delivered his first Christmas Day homily, reflecting on the suffering in Gaza and calling for peace through dialogue. He likened God's word to a fragile tent, drawing a parallel to the tents in Gaza exposed to harsh weather and to the plight of refugees and displaced persons worldwide. The Pope also acknowledged the vulnerability of populations affected by war and the senselessness felt by young people forced to fight. He emphasized that peace can only be achieved when dialogue replaces monologues and individuals recognize the humanity of others. Thousands attended the Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, with many capturing the event on their phones. Pope Leo XIV was also scheduled to deliver the traditional Urbi et Orbi blessing, summarizing the world's woes. This Christmas season marks the conclusion of the Holy Year celebrations, which will end on January 6th.
