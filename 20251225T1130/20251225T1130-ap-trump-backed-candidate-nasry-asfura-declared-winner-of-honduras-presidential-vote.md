## Article summary
Trump-backed candidate Nasry Asfura has been declared the winner of Honduras' presidential election, concluding a prolonged vote count that raised concerns about the nation's electoral system. This victory signifies a broader trend in Latin America, with a recent shift towards right-leaning leaders, following Chile's election of José Antonio Kast. Asfura, representing the conservative National Party, secured 40.27% of the vote, narrowly defeating four-time candidate Salvador Nasralla of the Liberal Party. The former mayor of Tegucigalpa, Asfura's win marks his second presidential bid. The election results also represent a setback for the incumbent leftist government, with the Liberty and Re-foundation Party's candidate finishing in a distant third place. International figures, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Argentine President Javier Milei, congratulated Asfura. Asfura campaigned on his infrastructure projects and received a last-minute endorsement from Donald Trump, who stated the U.S. administration would only work with him. Nasralla, however, alleged electoral fraud and accused Trump's endorsement of being electoral interference. The election process was further complicated by a slow vote count, which led to accusations of delays and potential manipulation, prompting concerns from the Organization of American States. Despite claims of fraud by some opponents, independent observers noted a clear rejection of the incumbent party's performance.
