## Article summary
A Powerball player in Arkansas has won a $1.817 billion lottery jackpot, marking the end of a three-month streak without a top-prize winner. The winning numbers were 04, 25, 31, 52, 59, with the Powerball number 19. This prize is the second-largest in U.S. history and the largest Powerball prize of 2025, with a lump sum cash payment option of $834.9 million. This victory follows 46 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner. The last Powerball jackpot winner was on September 6, when players in Missouri and Texas won $1.787 billion. It is the second time a Powerball jackpot has been won by a ticket sold in Arkansas; the first was in 2010. The last time a Powerball jackpot was won on Christmas Eve was in 2011. Powerball jackpots are designed to grow large due to odds of 1 in 292.2 million, though smaller prizes have better odds. Tickets cost $2 and are sold in 45 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
