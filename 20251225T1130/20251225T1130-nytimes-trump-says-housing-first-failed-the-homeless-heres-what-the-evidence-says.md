## Article summary
The Trump administration's plan to redirect homelessness aid challenges the Housing First philosophy, which provides subsidized housing without mandating treatment for mental illness or addiction. While Housing First has proven effective in securing housing for chronically homeless individuals, particularly veterans, its impact on improving mental or physical health and reducing mortality rates is less consistent. Evidence suggests that Housing First significantly increases housing stability in the short term, with studies showing high rates of clients securing housing. However, long-term housing retention can decrease, and many housed individuals continue to struggle with health issues. Research has not consistently demonstrated that Housing First improves health outcomes or lowers death rates. The effectiveness of treatment-first approaches, favored by the administration, is less rigorously studied, and direct comparisons show Housing First is more successful at housing people. Despite its successes, particularly with veterans, the overall rise in homelessness is attributed by some to the insufficient scale of Housing First and the broader issue of vanishing affordable housing and soaring rents. Critics argue that Housing First has not adequately addressed community-level homelessness and that the cost of supportive housing prevents larger-scale, cheaper interventions. Ultimately, the debate centers on what constitutes success and whether Housing First, despite its flaws, is the most effective strategy in the face of complex socioeconomic factors driving homelessness.
