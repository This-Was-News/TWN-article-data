## Article summary
The movie 'Marty Supreme' is loosely inspired by the real-life table tennis champion and hustler Marty Reisman. In the 1940s and '50s, Reisman was a star in New York City's gritty table tennis subculture, known for his electric game and charismatic showmanship. Nicknamed "The Needle," he won over 20 major titles, including two U.S. Opens, and was obsessed with the sport, viewing it as a blend of science and art. Reisman was also known as one of the game's "bad boys," once being fined and suspended for charging hotel expenses to the English Table Tennis Association. Growing up in a financially unstable household, Reisman found in ping pong both an escape from anxiety and a way to hustle for money. His daring style, elegant attire, and flair on the table, which included trick shots and even breaking cigarettes with a slam, captivated audiences. Director Josh Safdie, who co-wrote 'Marty Supreme,' related Reisman's unwavering belief in his dream to his own struggles with projects like 'Uncut Gems.' The advent of a new sponge rubber racket in 1952 significantly altered the game, and Reisman struggled to adapt, feeling it "destroyed his game." Despite this, he continued to be involved in table tennis, eventually owning a club and winning the U.S. Hardbat Championship at 67. Marty Reisman passed away in 2012 at the age of 82, remembered as a "throwback player" with a distinctive style.
