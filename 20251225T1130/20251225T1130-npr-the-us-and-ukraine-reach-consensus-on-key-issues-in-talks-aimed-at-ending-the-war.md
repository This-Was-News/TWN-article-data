## Article summary
The United States and Ukraine have reached a consensus on several key issues aimed at ending the nearly four-year conflict, although disagreements persist regarding territorial control in eastern Ukraine and the management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented a 20-point plan, developed after extensive talks in Florida, to Russian negotiators, with a response anticipated soon. The most contentious issue involves the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with the U.S. proposing free economic zones and Ukraine insisting on a referendum, demilitarization, and international forces. Another sticking point is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with the U.S. suggesting a tripartite consortium and Ukraine proposing a joint venture with the U.S. The plan includes security guarantees for Ukraine mirroring NATO's Article 5, a separate bilateral document with the U.S. detailing these guarantees, and a mechanism for monitoring a ceasefire. Other aspects of the proposal cover maintaining Ukraine's army size, setting a date for EU ascension, accelerating a free trade agreement with the U.S., and establishing a global development package for Ukraine's economic interests and reconstruction. The draft also requires Ukraine to hold elections post-agreement and calls for the release of all prisoners since 2014.
