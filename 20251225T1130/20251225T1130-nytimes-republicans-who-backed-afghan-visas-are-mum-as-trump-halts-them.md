## Article summary
In 2021, many Republicans in Congress strongly advocated for expanding a special visa program to help Afghan allies who had assisted Americans during the war. They argued for this program through letters, hearings, and press conferences, emphasizing the need to protect those facing retribution from the Taliban. However, following a shooting incident in Washington involving an Afghan man who had entered the U.S. under a temporary parole program, President Trump halted the Special Immigrant Visa program. This action effectively closed the last legal pathway for Afghans to enter the country. Many of the Republican lawmakers who were previously vocal proponents of the visa program have since become silent, with some acknowledging the program is now "severely damaged." Despite the bipartisan support for the visa program, which included rigorous vetting, the shooting shattered this consensus. Some Republicans now defer to the president's decision, while others suggest more vetting is needed. Democrats, however, criticize their Republican colleagues for abandoning Afghan allies and being unwilling to challenge Trump's decision. The incident has led to calls for increased scrutiny of immigrants, even though proponents of the visa program argue its vetting process is meticulous. Ultimately, the political climate has shifted, leaving Afghan allies in a precarious situation without a clear path to safety in the United States.
