## Article summary
North Korea has showcased apparent advancements in the construction of a nuclear-powered submarine, with state media releasing images of a nearly completed hull. Leader Kim Jong Un inspected the vessel, described as an 8,700-ton-class nuclear-propelled submarine, which he deems crucial for modernizing the navy and enhancing its nuclear armament. Kim condemned South Korea's pursuit of its own nuclear-powered submarine, viewing it as a direct threat to North Korea's security and sovereignty. He asserted that the completion of North Korea's submarine would significantly bolster its nuclear war deterrent. The images, released for the first time since March, depict a large, painted hull within an assembly hall, suggesting that core components may already be installed. Experts believe the submarine could potentially be tested at sea within months. A nuclear-powered submarine was among Kim's stated goals for advanced weaponry, alongside solid-fueled ICBMs and hypersonic weapons. Some analysts suggest North Korea's recent alignment with Russia may have facilitated the acquisition of crucial technologies for this project. Meanwhile, South Korea, with U.S. backing, is also seeking to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. In a separate development, North Korea also conducted tests of new anti-air missiles.
