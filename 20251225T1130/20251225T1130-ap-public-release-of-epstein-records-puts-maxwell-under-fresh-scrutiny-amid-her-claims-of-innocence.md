## Article summary
The public release of grand jury transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case has intensified scrutiny on her, even as she seeks immediate release from her 20-year sentence. These transcripts, part of the Justice Department's ongoing release of Epstein's investigative files, detail Maxwell's significant role in Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long abuse of young women. Maxwell, convicted in December 2021, claims new evidence proves constitutional violations tainted her trial, asserting that exonerating information was withheld and witnesses lied. The Justice Department is releasing these records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, though a recent discovery of over a million additional documents has delayed the full disclosure. An FBI agent's testimony within the transcripts describes how Maxwell groomed a 14-year-old girl, normalizing Epstein's abusive behavior and even participating in sexual encounters. Victims fear Maxwell may receive a pardon, with one accuser stating the released records sharpen the focus on Maxwell's criminal involvement. The judge has reprimanded Maxwell for failing to redact victim information from her court filings, emphasizing the need to protect their identities in future submissions.
