He discusses his interest in themes of misunderstood creatures, the allure of death, and the torment of everlasting life. Del Toro's childhood was marked by a precarious sense of death, shaped by his grandmother's nightly prayers. His life changed dramatically when his father won the lottery, allowing them to live in a house filled with exotic pets and a vast library that fueled his love for literature. Del Toro expresses his strong opposition to generative AI, comparing its creators to Victor Frankenstein for their arrogance and lack of consideration for consequences. He also shares his experiences with ICE crackdowns in LA, emphasizing the importance of empathy and understanding the 'other'.
