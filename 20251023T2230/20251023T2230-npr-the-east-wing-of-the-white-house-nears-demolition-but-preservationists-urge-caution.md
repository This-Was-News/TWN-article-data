## Article summary
The East Wing of the White House is being demolished to make way for a new 90,000 square foot ballroom, a project initiated by President Trump. The demolition, which includes the East Garden Room, Family Theater, and East Colonnade, is ahead of schedule and has raised concerns among preservationists. The White House insists the demolition is necessary to modernize the structure and enhance security. The project, initially estimated at $200 million, has seen costs rise to $300 million, funded by private donors including major corporations. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has urged a pause in demolition until public review processes are completed, but the White House has not yet submitted construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission. The commission's jurisdiction over the project is a point of contention, with differing opinions on whether demolition requires prior approval. Despite criticisms, the White House plans to rebuild and modernize the East Wing, ensuring it remains a beautiful and functional space for future generations.
