## Article summary
The U.S. and China are engaged in a tense trade negotiation, with both sides using various tactics to gain an advantage. The U.S. has widened sanctions on Chinese companies and threatened additional tariffs, while China has retaliated by expanding permitting requirements on rare earth materials and declaring its resolve to counter U.S. moves. Both sides are seeking to define what success looks like in these negotiations. The U.S. has greater capacity to impose costs, but China has a higher pain tolerance. China has flexed its muscles in areas like soybean purchasing and rare earth processing, while the U.S. has advanced technologies and the dollar as leverage. Analysts suggest that China is going on the offensive, setting the terms of the bilateral dynamic. The U.S. has been described as uncoordinated and surprised by Chinese retaliation, while China is said to be planning several moves ahead. If a deal is reached, it will likely be balanced, with both sides achieving some of their objectives.
