## Article summary
Two indictments unsealed in Brooklyn federal court on Thursday revealed schemes involving current and former NBA players and coaches defrauding gamblers and betting firms. One indictment accused an NBA player and a former coach of trading inside game information to win bets, while another charged current NBA coach Chauncey Billups with participating in rigged poker games organized by Mafia families, cheating victims out of millions. The schemes involved over 30 defendants and may have impacted game outcomes. Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat was accused of sharing insider information, like planned early exits due to injury, to help conspirators place winning bets. Billups and Damon Jones were linked to rigged poker games set up by organized crime families. The investigations, coordinated by the FBI and NYPD, have been ongoing for years and could lead to more charges. The poker scheme began in 2019 and used altered technology to cheat victims. The betting scheme, starting in December 2022, exploited confidential player information for profit. The NBA has placed Rozier and Billups on immediate leave and is cooperating with authorities. The charges are among the most serious since the 2007 Tim Donaghy betting scandal.
