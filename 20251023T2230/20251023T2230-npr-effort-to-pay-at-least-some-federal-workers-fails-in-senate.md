## Article summary
The Senate failed to pass two competing measures to pay federal employees during the government shutdown. The Republican bill aimed to pay essential workers, while the Democratic version sought to pay all federal employees and prevent mass layoffs. Both bills failed to gain enough support. The shutdown has lasted 23 days, affecting over a million workers who are set to miss a paycheck. Republicans and Democrats are at odds over funding and policy issues, with Republicans pushing for a temporary funding bill and Democrats insisting on a deal for health insurance subsidies. The shutdown is causing disruptions in services and travel, with both parties under pressure to resolve the impasse. Despite multiple votes, no agreement has been reached to reopen the government.
