## Article summary
The Trump administration has finalized plans to open the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, reigniting a long-standing debate. The decision, announced by U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, allows for future lease sales in the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, an area sacred to the Indigenous Gwichin. The plan aligns with President Trump's and congressional Republicans' pledges to reopen this portion of the refuge for potential development. A federal judge in March ruled that the Biden administration lacked authority to cancel previously issued leases. Indigenous communities near the refuge have mixed views, with some opposing drilling due to its impact on the caribou herd they rely on, while others support it for economic reasons. Conservationists argue that the administration is prioritizing corporate interests over the well-being of Indigenous communities and the environment. The decision is part of a broader set of actions by the Trump administration, including plans to build a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to connect King Cove and Cold Bay. Conservationists and tribal leaders have vowed to challenge the land exchange deal, citing concerns about the impact on migratory birds and the environment. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski has supported the road project, emphasizing the need for minimal disturbance to the refuge's ecosystem.
