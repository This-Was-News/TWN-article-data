## Article summary
The FBI has arrested Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, and former NBA player Damon Jones for their alleged involvement in two major illegal gambling schemes. The schemes, organized in part by New York crime families, involved hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal bets on NBA games and underground poker games. More than 30 people were arrested across eleven states, with more expected to surrender. FBI Director Kash Patel described the operation as involving tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft. One indictment involved placing bets on NBA games using non-public information, such as player injuries. Rozier and Jones allegedly passed confidential information to gamblers. Another indictment involved rigged poker games where victims were cheated out of millions. Billups and Rozier face charges of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. The NBA has placed both on leave and is cooperating with the investigation. Rozier's lawyer claims the arrest was a surprise and that Rozier is not a gambler. The investigation also involved former NBA player Jontay Porter, who was banned for life by the NBA in 2024.
