## Article summary
The New York City mob families, including the Gambinos, continue to operate despite a decline in their influence. Recent charges against members of four families reveal a sophisticated scheme to rig illegal poker games, involving high-stakes tables and NBA figures. While their control over industries like construction and trucking has waned, organized crime persists, particularly in the NYC metropolitan area. Investigators note this resilience despite decades of aggressive prosecutions and the recruitment of informants. The mob has adapted by avoiding violence and flashy behavior to evade law enforcement attention. The recent indictment in the poker case charged 32 men, including leaders and associates of the Genovese, Gambino, Bonanno, and Lucchese crime families. The case was brought by multiple agencies, including the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, the FBI, the NYPD, and the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor.
