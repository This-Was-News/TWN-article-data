## Article summary
The Hussaini siblings, Amir, Suraiya, and Bano, fled Afghanistan seeking refuge in the U.S. after the Taliban's return to power in 2021. They embarked on a long journey, hoping to find safety and a new life in the U.S. However, their hopes were shattered when President Donald Trump's administration closed the door to asylum. The family was separated, with Amir deported back to Afghanistan, Suraiya sent to Panama, and Bano stranded in Costa Rica. In Afghanistan, Amir faces constant fear and uncertainty, moving frequently to avoid detection. Suraiya and Bano struggle in their respective countries, with limited support and no clear path forward. The family's dreams of a better life have been replaced by despair and separation. The Hussainis' story highlights the broader challenges faced by refugees and the consequences of tightened asylum policies. Their journey and separation underscore the human cost of political shifts and the struggle for safety and dignity.
