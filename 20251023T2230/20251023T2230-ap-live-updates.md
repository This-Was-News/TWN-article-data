## Article summary
The Portland Trail Blazers' head coach, Chauncey Billups, and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier were arrested, along with over 30 others, in two separate criminal cases involving illegal betting and rigged poker games linked to Mafia families. Billups is accused of participating in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes card games in various locations, while Rozier is accused of exploiting confidential NBA information to fraudulently place bets. Both face money laundering and wire fraud conspiracy charges. The indictments reveal sophisticated cheating methods, including altered card shuffling machines and hidden cameras. The cases highlight vulnerabilities in the legal sports-betting industry and have raised concerns about the integrity of the NBA. Both Billups and Rozier have been placed on leave from their teams pending further investigation.
