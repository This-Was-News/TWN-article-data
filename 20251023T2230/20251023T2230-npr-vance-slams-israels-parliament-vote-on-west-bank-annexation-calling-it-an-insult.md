## Article summary
U.S. Vice President JD Vance criticized Israel's parliament vote on West Bank annexation, calling it an 'insult.' Vance's remarks came as he concluded his visit to Israel, where he also announced the opening of a civilian military coordination center in southern Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to visit the center and appoint a Foreign Service official to work with the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East. The U.S. is seeking support from allies, particularly Gulf Arab nations, to create an international stabilization force for Gaza and train a Palestinian force. Rubio criticized efforts by far-right Israeli politicians to annex the West Bank, a move the U.S. opposes. Meanwhile, Vance visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem and met with Israeli officials. The first medical evacuation from Gaza since the ceasefire began, with 41 critical patients and 145 companions evacuated. The World Health Organization called for more support for the remaining 15,000 patients awaiting medical care. An official from the U.N. Population Fund described the devastation in Gaza, highlighting the lack of healthcare facilities and the dire conditions for women giving birth. Israel's Supreme Court held a hearing on opening Gaza to international media, with the Foreign Press Association expressing disappointment over the government's continued denial of access.
