## Article summary
A partisan standoff over healthcare and spending is threatening to trigger the first U.S. government shutdown in almost seven years, with Democrats and Republicans in Congress unable to reach an agreement. The government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday if the Senate does not pass a House measure extending federal funding for seven weeks. Senate Democrats refuse to vote for it unless Republicans include an extension of expiring healthcare benefits, while President Donald Trump and Republicans refuse to negotiate, arguing the bill is noncontroversial. Senate Democrats need at least eight votes from Republicans to pass the bill, as Republican Sen. Rand Paul is expected to vote against it. Trump showed little interest in Democrats' demands on healthcare but agreed to a meeting with congressional leaders. After the meeting, Trump posted a fake video mocking Democrats, while Democrats vowed not to back down. Democrats are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans are open to extending the tax credits but want to place new limits on them. Democrats are in an uncomfortable position, as they have long denounced shutdowns but now face pressure from activists to stand up to Trump. Federal agencies are preparing contingency plans for a potential shutdown, which could lead to broad layoffs across the government.
