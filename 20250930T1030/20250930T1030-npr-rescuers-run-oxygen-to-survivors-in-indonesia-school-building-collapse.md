## Article summary
Rescuers in Indonesia are working to free survivors trapped in the rubble of a collapsed Islamic boarding school building in Sidoarjo, East Java. The collapse occurred on Monday, killing at least three students and injuring over 100, with dozens still missing. Rescue efforts were temporarily halted due to fears of further collapse but resumed later. Families anxiously await news of their loved ones, with 38 people presumed buried in the rubble. Heavy concrete slabs and unstable structures are hampering rescue efforts, with rescuers providing oxygen and water to trapped survivors. The school, Al Khoziny Islamic Boarding School, is one of the oldest in the province, housing over 2,000 students. The collapse happened during afternoon prayers in a building undergoing unauthorized expansion. Authorities are investigating the cause, with initial reports suggesting the old foundation could not support the added floors. Two more students died from their injuries on Tuesday, bringing the total deaths to five. Rescue teams are using various equipment and tools to support their efforts.
