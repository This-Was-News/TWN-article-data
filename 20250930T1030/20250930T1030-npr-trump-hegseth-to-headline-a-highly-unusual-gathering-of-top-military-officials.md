## Article summary
President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are set to address top U.S. military leaders at Quantico, Virginia, in an unusual gathering. Trump described the meeting as a positive discussion about military successes and morale, emphasizing 'esprit de corps.' The event, confirmed by U.S. military officials, was initially reported by The Washington Post. Speculation arose about potential firings of generals, as Hegseth has advocated for reducing their numbers by 20%. The gathering of global military leaders poses operational and national security challenges, further complicated by the president's attendance.
