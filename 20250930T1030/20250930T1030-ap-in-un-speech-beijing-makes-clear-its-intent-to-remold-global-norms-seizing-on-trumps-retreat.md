## Article summary
In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Chinese Premier Li Qiang outlined China's ambition to shape global norms, contrasting its approach with the U.S.'s retreat from international organizations. Li emphasized China's commitment to lowering tariffs, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and upholding the U.N.'s authority. Experts note a shift in China's foreign policy, reflecting a more confident and strategic posture aimed at reshaping a Western-dominant world order. Li criticized unilateralism and Cold War mentality, positioning China as a solution to global challenges. The speech aligns with Xi Jinping's Global Governance Initiative, which seeks to create a more just and equitable global system. Analysts suggest China aims to increase its influence within the U.N. and legitimize its vision for global governance. Despite assurances, there is skepticism about China's capacity and desire to offer a comprehensive alternative to the current order. The speech comes amid a trade dispute with the U.S., with both leaders scheduled to meet later to recalibrate relations. Li assured American businesspeople of China's commitment to market access and cooperation, reiterating Xi's line that the Pacific Ocean is vast enough for both nations.
