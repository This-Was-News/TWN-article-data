## Article summary
The presence of armed Border Patrol agents in downtown Chicago has intensified concerns over federal intervention in U.S. cities. Illinois leaders warned of a potential National Guard deployment as residents expressed anger and fear over increased immigration enforcement. Chicago Alderman Brandon Reilly criticized the display as a political stunt for President Donald Trump. Similar federal law enforcement surges were anticipated in Memphis, Portland, and New Orleans. Trump justified the actions by blaming Democrats for crime and lax immigration policies. Border Patrol agents in Chicago stated they would target anyone in the country illegally, raising concerns about discriminatory practices. Protests and aggressive tactics by federal agents have been ongoing, particularly around an immigration processing center outside Chicago. Activists reported instances of racial profiling and detentions in downtown areas. Meanwhile, Oregon's Attorney General sought to block the deployment of National Guard troops in Portland, citing abuse of power. Memphis residents expressed fears of increased immigration enforcement, while Louisiana's governor requested National Guard support to combat crime in New Orleans. Despite recent crime decreases in some cities, federal intervention continues to spark controversy and resistance.
