## Article summary
Women in Gaza report being exploited by men promising aid, food, or work in exchange for sexual interactions. A 38-year-old mother of six was lured to an empty apartment under the pretense of a job interview and was sexually exploited. She received minimal aid afterward but no job. As Gaza's humanitarian crisis worsens, women face increased sexual violence and exploitation. Six women shared their stories anonymously, fearing retribution. Psychologists report treating women who were sexually exploited, some becoming pregnant. Aid groups acknowledge the issue but find it challenging to document due to the war's chaos. Israel denies restricting aid, while aid organizations blame the crisis on Israel's offensive. Women describe being solicited by men posing as aid workers, often during aid registration. The scale of exploitation is difficult to determine due to underreporting and communication barriers. The PSEA network received 18 allegations last year, all involving aid workers or associates. Women feel trapped, fearing they won't be believed if they report the exploitation.
