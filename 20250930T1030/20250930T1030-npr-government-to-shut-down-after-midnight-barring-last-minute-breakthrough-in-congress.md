## Article summary
The U.S. government is on the brink of a shutdown as Democratic and Republican leaders remain deadlocked over funding negotiations and expiring health care subsidies. With less than 24 hours to reach a deal, Senate Democrats are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and the repeal of health care cuts enacted by a GOP bill. House and Senate leaders met with President Trump and Vice President Vance on Monday, but major differences persisted. Democrats accused Republicans of refusing to negotiate, while Republicans blamed Democrats for holding government funding hostage. President Trump posted a controversial AI-generated video targeting Democratic leaders, which was dismissed by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The standoff could have significant consequences for federal workers and government services, with the White House threatening to permanently fire non-essential workers. Both parties' bills are unlikely to secure the necessary votes in the Senate. Lawmakers' positions hardened on Monday, with no clear path to averting a shutdown. Essential services like Social Security and Medicare would continue, but delays in processing new applications and service disruptions are expected. The White House's memo instructing agencies to prepare for permanent layoffs was criticized by Democrats as an intimidation tactic. The Women and Infant Children (WIC) program is among those expected to be hit quickly in a shutdown.
