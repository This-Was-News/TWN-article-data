## Article summary
A government shutdown appears imminent after President Trump's meeting with Democratic leaders failed to yield an agreement. Democrats seek more health care funding, while Republicans accuse them of being unyielding. The shutdown could have significant impacts on federal workers and government services. Both sides blamed each other for the stalemate, with Democrats highlighting health care issues and Republicans calling for a funding extension first. The meeting came less than 32 hours before the shutdown deadline. Democrats warned of severe consequences if health care funding is not addressed, including millions losing coverage or facing higher premiums. Republicans plan to force another vote on the House-passed funding bill, daring Democrats to block it. The article highlights the partisan divide and the potential fallout from a government shutdown.
