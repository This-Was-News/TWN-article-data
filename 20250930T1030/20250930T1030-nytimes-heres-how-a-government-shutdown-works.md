## Article summary
The article explains the impending government shutdown if Congress fails to agree on funding by the deadline. A shutdown occurs when Congress cannot reach a funding deal, affecting various federal operations. Some services, like the Postal Service and Social Security, continue, while others, such as museums and national parks, close. Essential workers, like military personnel and air traffic controllers, must work without pay until the shutdown ends. The duration of the shutdown depends on political negotiations, currently centered on healthcare funding. Courts may face delays, and contractors could be affected based on their funding status. The shutdown ends when Congress passes an appropriations bill, but long-term impacts, including potential layoffs, may persist. The article highlights the historical context of shutdowns and the political blame game that accompanies them.
