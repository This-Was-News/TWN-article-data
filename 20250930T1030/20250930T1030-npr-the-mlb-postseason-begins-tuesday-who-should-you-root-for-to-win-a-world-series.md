## Article summary
The MLB postseason begins with a wide-open field, featuring no clear favorites. The Seattle Mariners, led by catcher Cal Raleigh, who hit 60 home runs this season, are aiming for their first World Series title, having never even reached the Fall Classic. The Mariners, as the AL's No. 2 seed, will face the winner of the Wild Card Series between the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Guardians. Other teams with long title droughts include the San Diego Padres and Milwaukee Brewers, who have never won a World Series. The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, historic rivals, will meet in the Wild Card round. The Toronto Blue Jays boast a strong lineup with multiple high-average hitters. The Philadelphia Phillies are a powerhouse with notable players like Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper. The Los Angeles Dodgers, fresh off their 2024 World Series win, are contenders despite some injuries, including superstar Shohei Ohtani. Other notable teams include the Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, and Cincinnati Reds, each offering unique strengths and exciting players.
