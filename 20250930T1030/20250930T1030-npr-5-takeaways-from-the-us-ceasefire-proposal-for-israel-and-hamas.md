## Article summary
The U.S. and Israel have agreed on a plan to potentially end the war in Gaza, but Hamas's acceptance remains uncertain. The plan includes the release of 48 hostages by Hamas in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detained Gazans. More aid would enter Gaza, distributed by the UN and Red Crescent, with no role for the Israeli-backed body. Hamas would decommission weapons and lose governance in Gaza. Palestinians are encouraged to stay, and a transitional body led by Tony Blair would oversee reconstruction. Governance could later shift to the Palestinian Authority if reforms are implemented. The plan has broad global support, including from Arab countries like Qatar and Egypt. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu presents the deal as a security victory but denies it leads to a Palestinian state. Hamas faces pressure from allies to accept the deal, which may allow it to survive and end the war. However, far-right members of Netanyahu's government oppose the plan, potentially destabilizing his coalition. The outcome remains uncertain, with possibilities ranging from full implementation to a partial hostage-prisoner exchange without further progress.
