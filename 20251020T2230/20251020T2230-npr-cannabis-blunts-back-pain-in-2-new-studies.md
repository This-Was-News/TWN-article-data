## Article summary
Recent studies from Europe suggest that cannabis may be an effective treatment for back pain, the leading cause of disability worldwide. Two major clinical trials found that a blend of cannabis oil, containing THC, CBD, and other natural compounds, outperformed a placebo and offered better relief over six months compared to opioids. The trials, conducted by Vertanical, a German company, showed that patients experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects with cannabis and found it more effective for pain relief and sleep. While the findings are promising, the regulatory environment in the U.S. makes it challenging to conduct similar large-scale trials. The FDA requires further research before considering approval, and experts are divided on the broader implications of these studies. Some see it as a significant step forward, while others caution that the benefits may be specific to the tested compound. Despite these nuances, cannabis is seen as a safer alternative to opioids, with a better safety profile and fewer concerns around addiction and overdose.
