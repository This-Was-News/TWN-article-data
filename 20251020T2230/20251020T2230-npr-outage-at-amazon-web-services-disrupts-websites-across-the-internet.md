## Article summary
An outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted numerous websites and apps, highlighting the critical role of AWS's cloud computing infrastructure in supporting modern businesses. The issue began early in the morning with increased error rates and latencies at an AWS facility in Northern Virginia. Popular services like Duolingo, Roblox, Fortnite, Coinbase, Robinhood, Venmo, and chatbots such as Perplexity and ChatGPT experienced disruptions. Major companies, including United Airlines, Canva, Reddit, and Flickr, also reported problems. The outage was caused by an error in a software update to AWS's database service DynamoDB, which triggered a chain reaction of service failures. Amazon acknowledged the issue and stated it was making progress in restoring full functionality. The incident underscores the vulnerability of companies relying on a few major cloud providers, with AWS holding about 30% of the worldwide cloud computing market. Experts note that while big providers offer strong cybersecurity and convenience, they also pose risks when outages occur, revealing the high level of dependency on these services.
