## Article summary
The Trump administration is reportedly undermining a court settlement designed to reunite and assist families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border, putting thousands at risk of being separated again. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a motion in federal court to return recently deported families to the U.S., alleging violations of a court order. Since April, the administration has gradually reduced services outlined in the settlement, including legal aid, housing assistance, and mental health support. The ACLU and advocates argue that these actions threaten the stability of the families covered by the settlement. The administration has defended its actions by citing cost-cutting measures and compliance with anti-discrimination laws. Despite court orders to reinstate services, the government continues to challenge the settlement agreement, leading to ongoing legal battles and uncertainty for the affected families.
