## Article summary
The Supreme Court will review whether individuals who regularly use marijuana can legally own guns, following a 2022 decision that expanded gun rights. The case involves Ali Danial Hemani, a Texas man charged with a felony for possessing a gun while being a regular marijuana user. The Justice Department, under President Donald Trump's administration, is appealing a lower court's decision that largely struck down a law barring drug users from owning guns. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the blanket ban unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's expanded view of gun rights but allowed its use against those accused of being high and armed simultaneously. Hemani's attorneys argue the law is overly broad, potentially affecting millions of Americans who have tried marijuana. The Justice Department contends the law is valid for regular drug users due to public safety risks. The case is part of ongoing debates about firearm restrictions following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that generally allows people to carry guns in public for self-defense. Arguments are expected in early 2026, with a decision likely by early summer.
