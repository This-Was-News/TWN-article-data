## Article summary
The White House began demolishing part of the East Wing to construct a new ballroom for President Donald Trump, despite not having approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. Dramatic photos showed a backhoe tearing into the East Wing façade, with debris scattered on the ground. Trump announced the construction start on social media and mentioned it during a meeting with college baseball champions. The East Wing, which houses several offices including the first lady's, will be temporarily relocated and modernized. Trump claims the ballroom has been desired for 150 years and will accommodate 999 people, making it the biggest structural change to the White House since the Truman Balcony. The project, costing $250 million, is set to be completed before Trump's term ends in January 2029. The East Wing, constructed in 1902 and renovated over the years, will undergo significant changes during the construction.
