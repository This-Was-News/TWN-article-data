## Article summary
Head Start programs, which serve tens of thousands of the nation's neediest preschoolers, are at risk of shutting down due to the government shutdown, which has halted federal funding. These programs, funded almost entirely by the federal government, are scrambling to stay open as they await new grants. Already, several programs have missed federal disbursements and are relying on reserves or local government help. In Florida, one program is drawing down reserves and seeking loans to stay open, while another in Kansas City may have to close. The shutdown also threatens other assistance programs like WIC, Medicaid, and food stamps. Head Start, launched during the War on Poverty, has faced funding cuts and shutdown threats in recent years. The current shutdown, stemming from a congressional standoff over health care subsidies and Medicaid cuts, is forcing Head Start programs to make difficult choices to keep their doors open.
