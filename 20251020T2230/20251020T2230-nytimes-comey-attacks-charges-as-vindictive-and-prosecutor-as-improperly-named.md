## Article summary
Lawyers for former FBI Director James B. Comey have filed motions to dismiss the criminal charges against him, arguing that the case is politically motivated and that the prosecutor was improperly appointed. The charges, which include perjury and obstruction of Congress, stem from a 2020 Senate hearing where Comey was accused of misleading the committee. Comey's legal team contends that President Trump's public attacks and personal animosity drove the indictment, violating due process principles. They also argue that the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, was improperly appointed and acted unilaterally in securing the indictment. The defense claims that Halligan's appointment violated the Constitution and federal statutes, potentially affecting other cases she has handled. The case highlights the unprecedented interference of the Trump administration in the Justice Department's affairs, with Trump publicly ordering the prosecution of one of his political adversaries. The defense aims to prove that the charges would not have been brought without Trump's personal vendetta, a challenging but potentially viable argument given the president's public statements. The outcome could have broader implications for other cases involving Trump's political opponents.
