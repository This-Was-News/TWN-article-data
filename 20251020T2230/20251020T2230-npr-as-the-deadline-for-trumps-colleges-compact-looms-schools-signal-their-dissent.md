## Article summary
The Trump administration has proposed a 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education' that requires participating universities to adhere to specific policies, such as barring transgender individuals from certain facilities and sports, freezing tuition, and limiting international student enrollment. The compact offers priority access to federal grants in exchange for compliance. As the deadline approaches, six out of the nine targeted universities have indicated they will not sign the compact. MIT was the first to reject it, citing disagreements with the principles and the belief that scientific funding should be based on merit. Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Southern California also declined. After a virtual meeting with the White House, the University of Virginia and Dartmouth College joined the list of schools refusing to sign. The White House has not yet responded to inquiries about the future of the compact, citing staff shortages due to a government shutdown.
