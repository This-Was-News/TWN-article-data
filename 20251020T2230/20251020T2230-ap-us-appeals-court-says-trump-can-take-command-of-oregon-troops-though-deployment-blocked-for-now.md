## Article summary
A U.S. appeals court has temporarily allowed President Donald Trump to take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, though their deployment is still blocked. The ruling overturned a lower court's decision that prohibited Trump from calling up the troops for deployment to Portland. The administration argues that Trump has the authority to federalize the troops to protect federal property from protesters. Oregon's Attorney General plans to challenge the decision, arguing it gives the president excessive power. The administration has faced legal challenges over deploying National Guard troops in Democratic-led cities, including Portland and Los Angeles. Protests in Portland have been relatively small, with federal agents using tear gas to disperse demonstrators. The appeals court majority supported Trump's decision, while a dissenting judge argued that the protests did not justify the deployment.
