## Article summary
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a temporary restraining order that had blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. The court majority ruled that the president likely acted within his legal authority to federalize the National Guard, citing ongoing protests and violence near an ICE facility. The ruling comes amid a series of Trump authorizations to deploy troops to various U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. The federal government argues that the National Guard is needed to protect federal assets and personnel, while local officials and residents dispute the characterization of Portland as a war zone. The decision applies to one of two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal judge in Portland, with the other order still in place. The ruling has sparked debate, with critics arguing it grants the president excessive power and supporters maintaining it is necessary to protect federal interests. The situation remains fluid, with potential further legal challenges and developments expected.
