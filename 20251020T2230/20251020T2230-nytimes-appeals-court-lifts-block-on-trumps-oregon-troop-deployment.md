## Article summary
An appeals court has allowed the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, overturning a lower court's ruling that protests in the city were largely peaceful. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's decision permits the deployment to proceed, despite ongoing legal challenges. The ruling was made by Judges Bridget Bade and Ryan Nelson, who cited instances of violence at protests near an ICE facility. Judge Susan P. Graber dissented, arguing that the decision undermines constitutional principles. The Trump administration has been seeking to deploy troops to Portland and other cities, citing concerns about violence and unrest. The legal battle is expected to continue, with Oregon and Portland seeking a broader hearing and a trial scheduled for later in the month. The Trump administration could also invoke the Insurrection Act if courts block the deployment. The ruling has sparked concerns about presidential overreach and the potential for further legal disputes.
