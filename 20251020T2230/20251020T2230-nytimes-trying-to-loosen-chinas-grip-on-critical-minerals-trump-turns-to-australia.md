## Article summary
The United States aims to reduce its reliance on China for rare earth minerals by securing access to Australia's mineral resources. President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a deal on Monday to facilitate this, with plans to invest up to $8.5 billion in related projects. The agreement comes after Trump criticized China's tightening of export controls on these critical minerals, which are essential for various modern industries, including defense. The U.S. and Australia will jointly invest $3 billion in critical mineral projects over the next six months, aiming to generate projects worth around $53 billion. The deal also includes U.S. investment in a new Australian refinery to extract gallium metal. Both administrations view increasing access to mineral-rich countries as key to strengthening global supply chains and reducing dependence on China.
