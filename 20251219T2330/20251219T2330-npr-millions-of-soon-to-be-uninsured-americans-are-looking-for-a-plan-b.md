## Article summary
Millions of Americans are facing significantly higher premiums for their Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans in 2026 due to the expiration of enhanced subsidies. An estimated 4.8 million people are expected to lose coverage and seek alternative solutions for healthcare. Robert and Emily Sory, who are starting an animal sanctuary, are among those who will become uninsured. They are exploring options like reduced out-of-pocket costs for doctor visits and utilizing special prescription drug programs. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are preparing for an increase in uninsured patients and offer services on a sliding scale based on income. Some FQHCs and hospital pharmacies partner with nonprofits like the Dispensary of Hope to provide donated medications for chronic conditions at no cost to eligible individuals. The expiration of subsidies is particularly concerning in states that have not expanded Medicaid, potentially leading to substantial increases in uninsured rates. Many individuals, like Emily Sory, understand the financial strain their lack of insurance might place on the healthcare system but feel they have no other choice due to affordability issues.
