## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a military operation in Syria to eliminate ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites following the deaths of three Americans. The large-scale strike targeted multiple locations and concentrated areas across central Syria. The operation, described by Hegseth as a "declaration of vengeance," was launched after President Trump pledged serious retaliation for the ambush attack that killed two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian interpreter. The attack, which occurred near Palmyra, also wounded three other U.S. troops and members of Syria's security forces. The assailant, who had recently been reassigned due to suspicions of IS affiliation, was killed. The operation utilized F-15 Eagle jets, A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft, AH-64 Apache helicopters, F-16 fighter jets from Jordan, and HIMARS rocket artillery. Syrian state television reported that strikes hit targets in rural areas of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa provinces, as well as the Jabal al-Amour area. White House officials emphasized that President Trump is delivering on his promise of retaliation. The slain guardsmen were identified as Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and the civilian interpreter was Ayad Mansoor Sakat. The attack posed a significant test for the improving U.S.-Syria relations.
