## Article summary
The Justice Department has released thousands of documents and hundreds of photographs related to investigations of Jeffrey Epstein, responding to a congressional deadline. The release includes numerous photos of individuals associated with Epstein, such as Ghislaine Maxwell, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Sarah Ferguson, Michael Jackson, and Mick Jagger, though the context of these photos is often unclear. While the release is mandated by law, the Justice Department has withheld some documents citing ongoing investigations or national security concerns, potentially reigniting controversy. President Trump's name appears sparingly in the released files, primarily in address books and flight logs, with most associated images already public. In contrast, former President Bill Clinton is featured more prominently, with dozens of photos, including one in a hot tub. The release stems from three main investigations into Epstein's interactions with young women. Despite efforts to delay, President Trump ultimately signed the legislation requiring the release. Much of the released material is heavily redacted to protect victims' identities and avoid jeopardizing ongoing investigations. Critics argue that the significant redactions violate the spirit of transparency. The Justice Department has indicated that more documents will be released by the end of the year after further review.
