## Article summary
Claudio Neves Valente, the suspect in the Brown University shooting and the killing of an MIT professor, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Valente, 48, was a former physics student at Brown University in the early 2000s and had a shared academic past with the MIT professor he is suspected of killing, Nuno F.G. Loureiro. Both men were classmates in the same physics program in Portugal. While Loureiro went on to excel in his career, Valente's path took a darker turn. He was dismissed from a Portuguese engineering school and withdrew from Brown without a degree. His life over the past two decades remains largely a mystery, with his last known address being a rented room in Miami. Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the shootings. The Brown University shooting occurred in a lecture hall, wounding nine others, and the professor was killed two days later at his home. Valente's history at Brown did not raise any public safety concerns during his time as a student.
