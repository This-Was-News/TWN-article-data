## Article summary
Conservatives clashed at Turning Point USA's annual youth conference over the direction of the MAGA movement, with prominent influencers attacking each other and their competing visions. Ben Shapiro criticized Tucker Carlson and others as "grifters and charlatans," particularly condemning Carlson's interview with antisemite Nick Fuentes. Carlson, in turn, mocked Shapiro's calls for deplatforming, stating it was "hilarious" and antithetical to the organization's late founder, Charlie Kirk. The feuding highlighted deep divisions within the Republican Party regarding the "America First" agenda and the Make America Great Again movement. Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk's widow and Turning Point's new leader, warned of "fractures" and "bridges being burned" since her husband's assassination. The conference also addressed conspiracy theories, including those spread by Candace Owens regarding Kirk's death, which Erika Kirk has publicly denounced. Shapiro's critiques of Owens and Carlson also reflect a growing fissure over support for Israel within the Republican Party. Despite the internal conflicts, the four-day conference drew thousands of attendees, featuring appearances from media personalities, administration officials, and religious figures, with many expressing solidarity with the memory of Charlie Kirk.
