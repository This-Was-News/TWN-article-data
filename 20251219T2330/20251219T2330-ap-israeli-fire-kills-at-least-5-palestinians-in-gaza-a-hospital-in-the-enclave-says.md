## Article summary
At least five Palestinians, including an infant, were killed by Israeli fire in Gaza City's Tuffah neighborhood on Friday, according to Shifa Hospital. The Israeli military stated that troops fired at suspicious individuals near the Yellow Line, an area demarcated by the ceasefire agreement, and that the incident is under review, with the military regretting any harm to uninvolved individuals. This event occurs as the Israel-Hamas truce, which began in October following the Hamas-led attack on Israel, shows signs of stalling. The initial phase of the ceasefire led to the release of most hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The conflict has resulted in over 70,660 Palestinian deaths, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The second phase of the ceasefire negotiations, aimed at establishing an international stabilization force, a governing body for Gaza, and the disarmament of Hamas, faces significant challenges. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy is scheduled to host talks with officials from mediating countries in Florida to advance these efforts. The ongoing situation in Gaza is marked by accusations of ceasefire violations from both sides, despite the truce having mostly held for three months.
