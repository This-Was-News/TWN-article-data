## Article summary
The Justice Department has released thousands of documents and hundreds of photographs related to investigations of Jeffrey Epstein, responding to a congressional mandate. This release, though voluminous, is unlikely to quell the controversy surrounding the Epstein files, as some documents were withheld due to ongoing investigations or national security concerns. Initial reviews of the files reveal numerous photographs of individuals associated with Epstein, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and celebrities like Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger, though the context of many photos remains unclear. The Justice Department stated it has identified 1,200 potential victims and has redacted materials that could reveal their identities. The release was mandated by an act of Congress, which President Trump ultimately signed despite initial Republican efforts to block it. The White House had reportedly sought to block the release of new information due to Epstein's past friendship with Trump. Previous attempts to release documents, including an overhyped dump in February, yielded little new material, and subsequent releases only renewed interest in the case. The released materials appear to stem from three main investigations: one by Palm Beach police in 2005, a federal prosecution in Florida ending in 2008, and a Manhattan inquiry in 2019 that was unresolved due to Epstein's death. While President Trump's name appears rarely in this release, often in already public documents like flight logs, former President Bill Clinton is featured more prominently, with dozens of photos including one in a hot tub. Many files remain heavily redacted, with Senator Chuck Schumer calling for transparency regarding these redactions. The Justice Department indicated that more documents will be released later this year after further review.
