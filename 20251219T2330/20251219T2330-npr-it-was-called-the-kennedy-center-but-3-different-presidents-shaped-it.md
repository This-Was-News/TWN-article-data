## Article summary
The Kennedy Center, a performing arts venue in Washington D.C., was shaped by the visions of three presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Eisenhower initiated the idea in 1955, envisioning an "artistic mecca" and establishing a commission for a National Cultural Center. Congress passed an act to build the venue, mandating diverse programming and public offerings. During the Kennedy administration, a fundraiser highlighted the arts' role in democracy and as a soft power during the Cold War. After Kennedy's assassination, the center was named a "living memorial" to him. President Johnson's "Great Society" furthered the vision, emphasizing popular access and participation in the arts. The center has since existed with a dual identity: a grand "palace of the arts" and a publicly accessible venue. Recent signage changes have added "The Donald J. Trump" to the center's name, a move that has sparked controversy regarding its legality and legacy. Art critic Philip Kennicott suggests that, similar to the renaming of Washington National Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the controversy surrounding the new name may fade over time as it becomes integrated into public vocabulary.
