## Article summary
The Department of Justice has begun releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein's investigations, including photos, call logs, and grand jury testimony, with many documents heavily redacted. This release is a partial fulfillment of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law by President Trump under political pressure. While the administration claims this demonstrates unprecedented transparency, critics, including Democratic lawmakers, express disappointment with the limited scope and redactions, vowing to pursue further legal avenues for full disclosure. The released records include extensive photographs of Epstein's properties and identify over 1,200 victims or their relatives, though their names are redacted. A small number of photos featuring President Trump and Epstein have also been released. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rubio held an extended press conference addressing various foreign policy issues, including the Russia-Ukraine war, Venezuela, and the Israel-Hamas conflict, emphasizing a reorientation of U.S. foreign policy towards national interests. Other news includes a lawsuit against the Trump administration over DEI-related grant cancellations, the U.S. and Canada reviewing their free trade agreement, and concerns about immigration and cost of living remaining high among Americans. The Kennedy Center is also moving to add Trump's name to its building, a decision some argue requires congressional approval.
