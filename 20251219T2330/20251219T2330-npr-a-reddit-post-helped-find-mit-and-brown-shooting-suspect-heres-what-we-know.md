## Article summary
A Reddit post from an observant witness was crucial in identifying the suspect responsible for the killings of two students at Brown University and an MIT physics professor. The suspect, identified as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, was found dead in a New Hampshire storage unit. Valente had past ties to Brown University as a former graduate student and knew the slain MIT professor from an academic program in Portugal. He initially came to the U.S. on a student visa but later became a legal permanent resident through the diversity immigrant visa program. The Reddit post provided key details, including a description of the suspect and the vehicle he was driving, which led investigators to him. The witness, referred to as 'John,' had a direct encounter with Valente before the Brown University shooting, describing his unusual behavior and attire. The Trump administration suspended the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program in response to these events. Authorities are still investigating Valente's activities between 2017 and the time of the shootings. While Valente cannot be prosecuted, officials hope this outcome brings some closure to the victims' families.
