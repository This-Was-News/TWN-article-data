## Article summary
A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration must reverse its cuts of over $2.6 billion in research funding to Harvard University, deeming the cuts illegal retaliation for Harvard's rejection of the administration's demands for changes to its governance and policies. The judge found that the government's claims of addressing antisemitism were a smokescreen for a politically motivated attack on the university. The ruling restores Harvard's federal funding, which had been frozen and later cut, affecting hundreds of research projects. The Trump administration plans to appeal the decision, calling the judge an activist Obama-appointed judge. Harvard scientists expressed concern about the future of their funding despite the court's ruling. The administration and Harvard are discussing a potential agreement to end investigations and restore funding, but no deal has been reached. The administration had accused Harvard of failing to address antisemitism and made demands for sweeping changes to campus protests, academics, and admissions. Harvard's president rejected the idea that the government should dictate the university's teachings, admissions, and research. The judge's order bars the government from future cuts that violate Harvard's constitutional rights or federal law, and agrees that the cuts were retaliatory and violated the university's First Amendment rights. The administration denies the cuts were retaliatory, stating that grants were under review before the demand letter was sent.
