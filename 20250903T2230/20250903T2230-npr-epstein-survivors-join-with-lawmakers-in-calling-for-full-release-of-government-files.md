## Article summary
Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse joined bipartisan lawmakers to demand the full release of government files related to the investigation. At a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol, survivors like Anouska De Georgou and Marna Lacerda shared their painful experiences and urged transparency. Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) are leading an effort to force a House vote requiring the Justice Department to release its records. The survivors and lawmakers argue that withholding information would conceal wrongdoing. The House Oversight Committee has already subpoenaed the Justice Department and released some documents, but critics say the information is heavily redacted. To pass their plan, Khanna and Massie need 218 signatures, with three Republicans already supporting the discharge petition. The issue has caused a rare split between President Trump and his supporters, as Trump has called for more file releases while his administration faces criticism. Democrats have highlighted Trump's past friendship with Epstein, which was mentioned by survivor Chauntae Daves during the press conference. Survivors also urged Trump to acknowledge their trauma and not dismiss their stories as a 'hoax'.
