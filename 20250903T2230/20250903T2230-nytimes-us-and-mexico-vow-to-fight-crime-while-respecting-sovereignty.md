## Article summary
The United States and Mexico agreed on Wednesday to enhance security cooperation to dismantle organized crime groups, particularly drug-trafficking cartels, and limit migration while respecting each other's sovereignty. This indicates a potential reduction in unilateral U.S. actions against suspected criminals, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum had previously stated that any U.S. incursions would be unacceptable. The announcement followed a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sheinbaum, along with Mexican officials, resulting in a joint statement outlining the formation of a bilateral high-level group to coordinate actions. Both leaders emphasized the shared threat posed by cartels to national security and praised ongoing cooperation. Sheinbaum highlighted the arrest of 59 high-value targets by Mexico, who were extradited to the U.S. to face drug-trafficking charges. Rubio praised Mexico's cooperation and noted the importance of respecting each country's sovereignty for fruitful collaboration. The meeting also addressed sensitive issues, including migration limits and counter-narcotics efforts, while Sheinbaum aimed to project resistance to perceived U.S. bullying and investigate political figures linked to the drug trade. Rubio, on his third trip to Latin America, praised a recent U.S. military strike on a drug-trafficking boat and emphasized the need to destroy such vessels to halt drug shipments. Both leaders agreed that criminal groups pose an immediate threat to the U.S., justifying Trump's use of any means to end the threat. Trump has directed the Pentagon to take military action against designated Latin American drug cartels and threatened tariffs on Mexican goods if Mexico does not crack down harder on cartels. Mexican officials have expressed concerns about potential U.S. military actions within Mexico and requested help in curbing the flow of weapons from the U.S. to Mexican cartels, which Rubio agreed to address through the new coordination group.
