## Article summary
A classified meeting between Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) was canceled after criticism from Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist. Warner questioned Loomer's authority over the intelligence community, highlighting her influence in the Trump administration. Loomer has been credited with several policy changes, including the suspension of visas for wounded Palestinian children and staff changes within the administration. The NGA, which handles satellite imagery and other geospatial intelligence, is led by Vice Adm. Frank Whithworth, a Biden appointee. Warner intended to discuss the NGA's use of artificial intelligence and other matters but was unable to do so due to the cancellation. Loomer claimed the NGA was 'infested with Trump haters' and called for Whithworth's dismissal. The Pentagon stated the meeting was rescheduled to accommodate bipartisan participation. Several administration officials have resigned or been dismissed following Loomer's criticism, including former FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vina Prasad and former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency head Jen Easterly. The State Department also suspended visas for individuals from Gaza after Loomer's social media posts questioned the visa process for Palestinian children seeking medical treatment in the U.S.
