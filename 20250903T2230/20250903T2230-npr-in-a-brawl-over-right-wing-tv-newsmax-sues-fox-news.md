## Article summary
Newsmax has filed a lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company, alleging that Fox has used its market power to suppress Newsmax's growth in the right-wing TV news market. Newsmax claims that Fox has secret agreements with cable companies to block Newsmax and other independent conservative channels from getting carriage. The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Miami. Fox has rejected the allegations, stating that Newsmax cannot sue its way out of its own competitive failures. The lawsuit is seen as a consequence of the fallout from President Trump's electoral loss in 2020, which led to a significant loss of viewers for Fox News. Newsmax argues that Fox was focused on competition from smaller, right-leaning outlets rather than conventional news peers like CNN. The lawsuit alleges that Fox engages in at least three anticompetitive practices, including imposing 'no carry' provisions for competing right-wing outlets and requiring distributors to carry Fox Business and sister outlets. Newsmax is suing under federal and state law in Florida.
