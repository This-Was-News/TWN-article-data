## Article summary
President Trump has suggested deploying National Guard troops to New Orleans, citing Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry, who has expressed willingness to accept federal help. Trump mentioned that the deployment could take about two weeks and also floated the idea of sending troops to Chicago, New York, and Baltimore, despite opposition from Democratic governors in those areas. He argued that politicians in these cities are out of touch with their constituents' concerns about crime. While Trump has stated he would wait for governors to request support, he has also claimed the right to send in the National Guard unilaterally. His administration is currently fighting a lawsuit over the deployment of troops to Los Angeles, where a federal judge ruled that the action violated federal laws prohibiting military use for domestic law enforcement. Trump has portrayed Democrats as being in favor of crime, predicting it will be a major issue in the upcoming midterm elections. He previously described the deployment in Washington, D.C., as a model for other locations, though his authority in the district differs from that in the states.
