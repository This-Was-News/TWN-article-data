## Article summary
Jasveen Sangha, known as the 'Ketamine Queen,' has pleaded guilty to supplying the drugs that led to the death of actor Matthew Perry, known for his role in 'Friends.' Sangha faces a maximum sentence of 65 years in federal prison, with her sentencing set for December 10. Perry, who struggled with addiction, was found dead in a hot tub at his home on October 28, 2023, with the cause of death determined to be an acute ketamine overdose. Sangha pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including maintaining a drug-involved premises, distributing ketamine, and distribution resulting in death or serious bodily injury. She also admitted to other offenses, such as possessing drugs with intent to distribute and selling ketamine to another man who died of an overdose. Federal investigators found that Sangha tried to distance herself from Perry's death by instructing an associate to delete text messages. Sangha is the last of five people charged in connection with Perry's death to plead guilty. Ketamine overdoses are relatively rare, with the drug being federally approved for medical use but often taken illegally for recreational purposes.
