## Article summary
President Donald Trump suggested deploying National Guard troops to New Orleans, citing a crime problem despite local leaders pointing to a significant drop in crime rates this year. Republican Governor Jeff Landry supported the idea, while local Democratic leaders opposed it, calling it an unnecessary show of force. Trump has already planned similar deployments to Chicago and Baltimore. Meanwhile, Florida announced plans to eliminate vaccine mandates, aligning with the Trump administration's public health agenda. A federal judge ordered the restoration of funding cuts to Harvard University, and the White House criticized the decision. Trump also hinted at an upcoming call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. Additionally, a bipartisan group in the House pushed for a ban on stock trading by lawmakers and their families, gaining momentum after previous stalls. The FBI announced indictments against Chinese suspects and companies involved in fentanyl trafficking, underscoring the administration's focus on combating drug cartels. The League of Women Voters criticized a new policy restricting voter registration at naturalization ceremonies, calling it an attack on immigrants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised cooperation with Mexico on security and immigration issues, though tensions remain over potential tariffs on Mexican imports.
