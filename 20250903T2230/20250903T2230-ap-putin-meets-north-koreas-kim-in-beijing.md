## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held bilateral talks in Beijing on Wednesday, following a major military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The meeting took place at the Daoyutai state guest house, with both leaders traveling together to the negotiations. Putin praised North Korean soldiers for their role in repelling a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk border region. Kim emphasized the strengthened cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow since their strategic partnership pact was signed in June 2024. Kim also expressed willingness to support Russia further, framing it as a fraternal duty. The event marked Kim's first attendance at a major multilateral event during his 14-year rule and the first time he, Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping gathered at the same venue. Observers speculate about potential bilateral or trilateral meetings, though none have been confirmed. U.S. President Donald Trump's social media post referencing the three leaders was dismissed by Putin's advisor as lacking seriousness.
