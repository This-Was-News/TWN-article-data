## Article summary
President Trump has significantly expanded the use of American military force, both domestically and internationally. He ordered attacks on boats near Venezuela, targeting individuals linked to drug cartels, with Vice President JD Vance defending the actions as necessary to combat narco-terrorism. Trump also announced the deployment of National Guard troops to Memphis to address crime and investigate potential domestic terrorist groups following the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. This approach marks a shift from his first term, where he was often restrained by his defense secretary. Cabinet members now support his aggressive stance, bending counterterrorism laws to his will. The administration's actions are partly driven by a desire to project a strong, macho image, as seen in recent recruitment posters and social media posts featuring Trump in military gear. The world is witnessing a more assertive Trump, willing to use force against both foreign and domestic enemies.
