## Article summary
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., warns that the Trump administration is exploiting the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to target and silence progressive groups, labeling them as terrorists or inciters of violence. Murphy argues that this strategy is 'straight out of the totalitarian playbook' and could lead to a 'dark time' for the country. He criticizes the administration's use of the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to disrupt networks opposed to the president's agenda. Kirk's death has sparked debate over his legacy and the appropriate response to his killing, with critics highlighting his controversial remarks. Murphy emphasizes the importance of condemning political violence from all sides and urges Americans to support groups working to protect democracy. He also dismisses claims that Democrats' rhetoric contributes equally to heightened tensions, stating that his comments were about defending fair elections. Murphy advises vigilance and resistance against efforts to suppress dissent, urging people to join and support organizations working to safeguard democracy.
