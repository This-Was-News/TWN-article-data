## Article summary
President Donald Trump has vowed to end mail-in voting, creating a dilemma for some Republican candidates in Western battleground states who benefit from it. In Arizona, both Trump-endorsed gubernatorial candidates, Andy Biggs and Karrin Taylor Robson, have differing stances on mail voting. Biggs does not support its elimination, while Robson has not clearly stated her position. Mail voting has been crucial for Republican victories in Arizona, including Trump's 2024 win. Despite Trump's claims of fraud, there is no evidence of widespread issues with mail voting. Arizona Republicans pioneered mail voting expansion in the 1990s, but recent election integrity conspiracies have caused controversy. In Nevada, Governor Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has endorsed Trump but has not explicitly supported his call to end mail voting. Lombardo has focused on common-sense election reforms like voter ID. The dynamic highlights the challenge for GOP candidates to balance allegiance to Trump with the convenience of mail voting for their voters.
