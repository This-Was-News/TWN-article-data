## Article summary
Israeli troops and tanks are advancing into Gaza City, marking the second day of a ground offensive that has drawn international condemnation. The military has conducted over 150 strikes in the area, targeting high-rise towers allegedly used by Hamas, resulting in significant civilian casualties. At least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in overnight strikes, bringing the total death toll in Gaza to nearly 65,000 since the war began in October 2023. Palestinians are fleeing Gaza City en masse, with Israel opening a new evacuation corridor to the south. Hospitals in Gaza report severe damage and casualties, including strikes on the Rantisi Hospital for children. Aid groups and Qatar have strongly condemned Israel's actions, with some accusing Israel of committing genocide. Israel aims to control most of Gaza, including Gaza City, where famine conditions are reported. Despite previous raids, Israel plans to maintain control this time, estimating around 2,000 to 3,000 Hamas militants remain in the city. The war began with a Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, resulting in around 1,200 deaths and 251 hostages, with 48 still believed to be alive in Gaza.
