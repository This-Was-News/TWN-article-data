## Article summary
FBI Director Kash Patel faced intense scrutiny from Democrats during a contentious Senate hearing, defending his record against accusations of politicizing the FBI and retaliating against Trump adversaries. The hearing highlighted partisan divisions, with Republicans supporting Patel while Democrats questioned his integrity and leadership. Patel clashed verbally with Democratic senators, including Adam Schiff and Richard Blumenthal, accusing them of grandstanding. He touted the FBI's achievements in combating violent crime, child abuse, and drug trafficking but faced criticism over a premature social media post about the arrest of a suspect in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which later proved incorrect. Democrats raised concerns about the firing of experienced FBI agents, alleging political retaliation, while Patel denied taking orders from the White House. He defended his actions, citing the arrest of thousands of violent felons and the seizure of weapons and child predators. The hearing also touched on the FBI's investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and unsubstantiated theories about pipe bombs placed in Washington. Republicans praised Patel's efforts to refocus the FBI on law enforcement missions, contrasting his leadership with his predecessor's politicized tenure.
