## Article summary
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have proposed ending mental health screenings in schools, advocating instead for strong families, nutrition, fitness, and hope for the future. They argue that screenings medicalize children's behavior and create stigmas. However, mental health experts counter that screenings are crucial for starting conversations about mental health, reducing stigma, and identifying students' struggles. These screenings are universal and aim to provide insights into students' well-being, helping schools implement programs to boost mental health. Experts emphasize that screenings are not diagnostic but serve as a first step to connect students to appropriate care. Early detection through screenings can prevent crises and bridge gaps in access to mental health care. While natural sources of mental well-being are important, they are not sufficient alone, making regular screenings essential. The proposal has faced criticism from experts who highlight the importance of screenings in addressing the high prevalence of mental health disorders among children.
