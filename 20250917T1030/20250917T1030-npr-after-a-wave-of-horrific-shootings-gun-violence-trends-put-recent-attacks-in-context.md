## Article summary
A recent wave of high-profile shootings, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and attacks at a Colorado high school and a Minnesota church, has brought renewed attention to gun violence in the U.S. Experts note that mass shootings are more frequent now than 50 years ago, though they represent a small fraction of overall gun deaths. Many mass shootings are linked to domestic violence, and school-related gun incidents have surged since the pandemic. Political violence has also been rising, with a significant increase in threats against members of Congress. Research shows that individuals with hateful beliefs are more likely to justify political violence, but family influence can help curb such sentiments. In 2023, over 46,000 people died from gun-related injuries, with suicides making up the majority. A survey found that 1 in 5 Americans have been threatened with a gun, and many have taken precautions, including purchasing firearms for protection. However, unsafe gun storage practices remain common, highlighting the need for better gun safety awareness.
