## Article summary
As authorities searched for the shooter who killed Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, court documents revealed that 22-year-old Tyler Robinson confessed to his romantic partner via text messages. Robinson, who fired the fatal shot from a rooftop, texted his partner about the shooting, expressing regret and acknowledging his actions. Despite knowing about the confession, the partner did not alert law enforcement. Robinson remained on the run until his parents recognized him in a released photo and helped arrange his surrender. Charged with capital murder and other counts, Robinson could face the death penalty. Investigators are examining if others knew about or aided Robinson, though the partner's involvement is unclear. Prosecutors allege Robinson used his grandfather's rifle, with DNA evidence linking him to the weapon. Kirk, a prominent conservative figure, was known for his political influence and activism. The motive remains unclear, but texts suggest Robinson was driven by political disagreements and personal grievances. The case has sparked discussions about political violence and societal divisions in the U.S.
