## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump is in the UK for a state visit, the first U.S. president to receive a second state visit. The visit includes meetings with King Charles III at Windsor Castle and Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers. The British government hopes to secure a multibillion-dollar technology deal to strengthen trans-Atlantic ties despite differences over Ukraine, the Middle East, and Western alliance. The visit features royal pageantry, including horse-drawn carriages, military honors, and a state banquet at Windsor Castle. Protests are expected in London against Trump's visit, with activists criticizing his policies and rhetoric. Police are preparing for significant operations to manage the protests. Despite diplomatic efforts, Trump's stance on Ukraine and Gaza differs from Starmer's. The visit highlights the blend of modern diplomacy and traditional royal ceremonies.
