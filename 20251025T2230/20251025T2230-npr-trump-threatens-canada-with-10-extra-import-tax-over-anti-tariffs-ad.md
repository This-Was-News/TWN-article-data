## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced on Saturday his intention to impose an additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports. This decision stems from an anti-tariff television advertisement aired by the province of Ontario, which Trump characterized as a "misrepresentation of the facts" and a "hostile act." The ad reportedly used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs, a move that angered Trump. Ontario Premier Doug Ford stated he would withdraw the ad after the weekend, though it aired during the World Series on Friday night. It remains unclear when the new tariff hike will take effect or if it will apply to all Canadian goods. Canada's economy is significantly impacted by existing U.S. tariffs, with over three-quarters of its exports going to the U.S. Some Canadian products already face tariffs as high as 35%, with steel and aluminum at 50%. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are both scheduled to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia, but Trump indicated he has no plans to meet with Carney. Trump believes the ad misrepresented Reagan's stance on tariffs, despite Reagan's historical skepticism towards them. The President also suggested the ad was an attempt to influence the U.S. Supreme Court regarding upcoming arguments on his tariff powers.
