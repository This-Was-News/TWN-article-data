## Article summary
A federal judge has ruled that the detention of Ruben Torres Maldonado, a Chicago man whose daughter is battling advanced cancer, is illegal. The judge ordered that Torres must be given a bond hearing by October 31st. Torres's attorneys see this ruling as a victory, and they plan to continue fighting for his release on bond while he seeks permanent residency. Torres, a painter and home renovator, was detained on October 18th, and his 16-year-old daughter, Ofelia, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of soft-tissue cancer. She has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Torres entered the U.S. in 2003 and has two U.S. citizen children with his partner. His daughter expressed that it is unfair for hardworking immigrant families to be targeted. The Department of Homeland Security alleges Torres has been living illegally in the U.S. and has a history of driving offenses. They stated that this is an attempt to keep an "illegal alien" in the country. Attorneys for the family argued that Ofelia's treatment had been disrupted due to the stress and disruption caused by her father's arrest. The government's prosecution stated that Torres did not cooperate during his arrest. The arrest occurred amid a broader immigration crackdown in the Chicago area known as "Operation Midway Blitz."
