## Article summary
Coolidge Auditorium, located within the Library of Congress, is celebrating its 100th anniversary as a premier venue for musical performances. Established in 1925 through the vision and philanthropy of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, the intimate 485-seat hall is renowned for its exceptional acoustics and has hosted a diverse array of artists, from classical luminaries like Béla Bartók and Igor Stravinsky to contemporary icons such as Stevie Wonder and Audra McDonald. Coolidge's initial donation and subsequent endowments have facilitated the commissioning of numerous new musical works, including Aaron Copland's iconic ballet *Appalachian Spring*, which premiered at the auditorium. The venue also benefits from the Library's extensive music collection, including a rare set of Stradivarius instruments gifted by Gertrude Clarke Whittall, which are played by resident quartets and visiting musicians. Over the decades, Coolidge Auditorium has served as a vital cultural hub, preserving musical history while fostering innovation through commissions and performances spanning various genres, from jazz and spirituals to contemporary electronic music. Despite facing temporary closures, such as a recent government shutdown impacting its anniversary celebrations, the auditorium continues to be a significant space for artistic expression and a testament to the enduring power of music.
