## Article summary
Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and significant financial supporter of President Trump, has been identified as the anonymous donor who contributed $130 million to the U.S. government to ensure troops are paid during the ongoing shutdown. President Trump announced the donation, praising the donor as a patriot but keeping his identity private at the donor's request. Mellon, an heir to the Mellon fortune and a railroad magnate, was not a prominent Republican donor until Trump's election, after which he began pouring substantial funds into Trump's campaigns and the Republican Party. He has also provided significant financial backing to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign and his anti-vaccine organization. The Pentagon has accepted the donation, intended to cover service members' salaries and benefits, though it may potentially violate the Antideficiency Act. This donation comes as thousands of federal workers are facing missed paychecks due to the shutdown. Mellon, who primarily resides in Wyoming, maintains a low public profile despite his extensive political spending. He has previously expressed a desire for privacy regarding his political contributions, stating he contributes to whom he wishes without needing to explain why. Mellon has also authored books, including an autobiography with controversial passages on race and a book about his business dealings, published by the same company that released Melania Trump's memoir.
