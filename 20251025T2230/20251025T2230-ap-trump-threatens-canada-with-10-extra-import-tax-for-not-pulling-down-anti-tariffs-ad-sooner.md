## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced plans to increase tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10% due to an anti-tariff advertisement aired by the province of Ontario. Trump stated the ad, which used words from former President Ronald Reagan, misrepresented facts and constituted a hostile act. He expressed anger that the advertisement was not immediately removed, as he had demanded. Trump indicated this action would halt ongoing trade talks with Canada. Ontario Premier Doug Ford confirmed the ad would be taken down after the weekend. The White House has not yet specified the legal authority for the increased tariffs or the scope of goods affected. Canada's economy has already been significantly impacted by Trump's existing tariffs, with a large portion of its exports going to the U.S. The ad's content was reportedly aimed at influencing an upcoming Supreme Court case regarding Trump's tariff authority. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are both scheduled to attend a summit in Malaysia, but Trump stated he does not intend to meet with Carney there.
