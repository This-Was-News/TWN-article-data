## Article summary
For one week every October, a temporary one-hour reduction in the time difference between Europe and the United States can cause confusion for international scheduling. This occurs because Europe switches from daylight saving time to standard time earlier than the U.S. and Canada. Most countries do not observe daylight saving time, and among those that do, the dates for changing clocks vary due to differing legal developments. In countries observing daylight saving, clocks are moved forward in spring to maximize daylight and fall back in autumn. Specifically, the UK and Europe change their clocks on the last Sunday in October, while the U.S. and Canada do so on the first Sunday in November. This discrepancy creates a week where the transatlantic time difference is shorter than usual. Daylight saving time was first standardized in the early 20th century, adopted by Europe during World War I to conserve energy, and later by the U.S. and Canada. While EU member states coordinate their clock changes, broader international coordination has not been successful. In the U.S., a 1966 law established a uniform daylight saving time, but the transition dates have been modified over time, with the current dates set by Congress in 2005. Despite proposals to eliminate seasonal time changes in both the U.S. and Europe, no permanent alterations have been enacted.
