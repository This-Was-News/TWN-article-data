A shooting incident occurred at the Austin Central Library on Saturday, resulting in one person being injured. Police responded to the scene, and a shelter-in-place alert was issued for the surrounding area. The victim was transported to a local hospital and is reported to be in serious but stable condition. The suspect fled the scene before officers arrived but was later apprehended in the South Austin neighborhood.

The library was evacuated, and the shelter-in-place order was subsequently lifted.
