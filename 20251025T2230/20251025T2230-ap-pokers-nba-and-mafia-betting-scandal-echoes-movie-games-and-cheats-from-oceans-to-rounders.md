## Article summary
A recent federal indictment of a big-money poker ring involving NBA figures, with alleged Mafia involvement and cheating of unsuspecting rich players, echoes themes from numerous films and television shows. Fictional and actual poker have long been in a pop-cultural feedback loop, with movies like "The Sopranos," "Ocean's Eleven," and "Molly's Game" depicting similar scenarios of celebrity-filled games and clever cheating schemes. George Clooney, whose films often feature such plots, humorously noted that they are now blamed for everything, even comparing the poker scandal to a Louvre heist. "Molly's Game," based on Molly Bloom's memoir, detailed how to attract wealthy players to exclusive games, a strategy similar to that allegedly used by the indicted organizers. The allure of these games often stemmed from the presence of celebrities, who acted as attractors for less experienced players, or "fish." The legality of private poker games has long been disputed, especially when hosts profit like casinos. Poker and cheating have been prominent in films since the silent era, with notable examples including "Tall in the Saddle," "The Gunfighter," "The Cincinnati Kid," "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," and "The Sting." The 1998 film "Rounders" significantly boosted the popularity of Texas Hold'em, contributing to a boom in online poker and the development of technologies that allowed players to see each other's cards, similar to the alleged cheating methods in the recent scandal. The "Ocean's" films further amplified the mystique surrounding poker, making it a spectator sport.
