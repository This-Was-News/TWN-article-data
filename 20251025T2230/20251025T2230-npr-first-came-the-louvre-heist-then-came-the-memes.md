## Article summary
The recent daylight heist at the Louvre, where nine priceless jewels were stolen in under seven minutes, has captured global attention and quickly transitioned into widespread internet memes. Authorities are actively investigating, with over 100 people working on the case and forensic analysis underway on over 150 trace samples. One of the stolen items, Empress Eugénie's diamond-and-gold encrusted crown, was found damaged near the scene. The estimated value of the missing jewels is $102 million, though they are described as "priceless" and the theft as a "humiliation" to France. Questions are being raised about the museum's security, particularly the lack of cameras in the Apollo Gallery where the robbery occurred. The thieves utilized an electric lift to enter and exit the museum, a detail that prompted playful social media posts from the lift's manufacturer, Böcker, and IKEA. The heist has inspired Halloween costumes and become a template for viral marketing, with brands and influencers capitalizing on the event. The public's fascination is partly attributed to the fantasy of a daring escape and the appeal of a thrilling story over tragic news. Hollywood has also engaged with the event, with George Clooney joking about robbing the Louvre himself. A viral image of a well-dressed passerby near the museum was quickly dubbed an "Inspector Clouseau" figure, further fueling the meme phenomenon, even prompting a playful response from the Paris prosecutor's office.
