## Article summary
Speaker Mike Johnson has put the House of Representatives on an indefinite hiatus, extending into its second month during the government shutdown. This decision is the latest in a series of actions that have diminished the role of Congress and the speakership itself. With no policy debates or votes occurring on the House floor and spending legislation not being considered, oversight hearings are also on hold. Johnson argues the House has no reason to meet while Senate Democrats block a bill to reopen the government. This approach, born of political expediency, risks further ceding power to the executive branch, a trend that has already seen Congress lose significant influence. Unlike many past speakers who sought to be governing partners with the president, Johnson appears to have made himself subservient to President Trump. This is exemplified by Trump's reported joke about being both speaker and president, a sentiment Johnson has done little to contest. Furthermore, Johnson has refused to swear in Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, claiming he lacks the power to do so, despite her winning election a month prior and subsequently suing to take her seat.
