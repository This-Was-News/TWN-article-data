## Article summary
President Trump is embarking on a nearly week-long trip to Asia, with a significant focus on trade relations and diplomatic engagements. The itinerary includes meetings with leaders from Japan and Malaysia, and a high-stakes encounter with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Korea. Trump's visit occurs amidst ongoing trade tensions with China, exacerbated by recent export limits on rare earth minerals, though Trump remains optimistic about securing a deal. A key event will be Trump presiding over a peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, a conflict he claims to have helped resolve. In Korea, Trump will meet with President Lee Jae Myung to finalize a trade agreement, which includes Korea's pledge to invest billions in the U.S., and potentially discuss North Korea. Trump has also expressed openness to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. While in Japan, Trump is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and address personnel at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka. The meeting with Xi Jinping is anticipated to be a critical moment for both nations to reassess their trade positions, with experts suggesting it may lead to an extension of the current trade truce rather than an immediate resolution.
