## Article summary
South Florida is expected to experience the most significant impact if enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, approved during the pandemic, expire at the end of the year. An estimated third of Florida's 4.7 million ACA plan enrollees could lose their coverage due to increased costs. The state's demographics, including a large population of low-wage workers, self-employed individuals, and early retirees, contribute to its high demand for ACA plans. Florida's decision not to expand Medicaid further exacerbates the situation. While ACA enrollment surged nationally with the increased subsidies, their expiration on December 31st is creating political urgency, with Democrats sounding alarms and insurers notifying enrollees of upcoming premium hikes. Older individuals in the lower-middle class, earning around $65,000, are particularly vulnerable to significant premium increases. Some Florida Republicans, like Governor Ron DeSantis, argue that the enhanced subsidies are too costly for taxpayers and advocate for more basic catastrophic plans. However, some Republican representatives in districts with high ACA enrollment are urging for a solution to the ongoing government shutdown, which is linked to the subsidy debate. The number of ACA enrollees in Florida has doubled since 2021, highlighting the critical role these subsidies play in maintaining coverage for many residents who face rising living costs and limited employer-provided insurance options.
