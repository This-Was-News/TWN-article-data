## Article summary
The official portrait of Admiral Rachel Levine, the first transgender person to hold a Senate-confirmed position as Assistant Secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), was altered during a federal shutdown. The change involved replacing her current name with a prior name beneath the portrait in a hallway displaying past leaders of the Public Health Corps. A spokesperson for HHS confirmed the alteration, stating their priority is to "reverse harmful policies enacted by Levine and ensuring that biological reality guides our approach to public health." Admiral Levine, who served for four years, called the action "petty." Her former deputy assistant secretary for health policy and current spokesperson, Adrian Shanker, condemned the move as an "act of bigotry" and unprecedented, urging current HHS leadership to focus on public health challenges rather than "vindictively" targeting Levine. The change has been described by an HHS staff member as "disrespectful" and an "erasure of transgender individuals." This incident occurs amidst a broader political climate where transgender individuals have faced significant challenges and curtailment of rights through federal agencies, with former President Trump frequently characterizing transgender people as a "danger to society."
