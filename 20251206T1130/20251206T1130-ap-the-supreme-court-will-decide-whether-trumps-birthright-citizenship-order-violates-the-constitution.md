## Article summary
The Supreme Court has agreed to review the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. This order, signed on his second term's first day, aimed to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The order, which has not taken effect anywhere, is part of the administration's broader immigration crackdown. Lower courts have consistently struck down the order, deeming it unconstitutional and a violation of the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment has long been understood to confer citizenship on all individuals born on American soil, with few exceptions. The case originated from a federal judge's ruling in New Hampshire that blocked the order in a class-action lawsuit. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing the families challenging the order, asserting that no president can alter the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship. The administration argues that children of noncitizens are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction and thus not entitled to citizenship. This legal battle over birthright citizenship is the first immigration-related policy from the Trump administration to reach the Supreme Court for a final decision. The case is expected to be argued in the spring, with a ruling anticipated by early summer.
