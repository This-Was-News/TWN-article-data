## Article summary
The Trump administration is expanding its travel ban to include citizens from over 30 countries, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. This expansion builds upon a previous ban implemented in June that affected 12 countries and restricted access for seven others. The announcement follows the shooting of two National Guard members by an Afghan national, which has led to increased scrutiny of immigration policies. Noem indicated that countries lacking stable governments or the ability to properly vet their citizens might be included in the expanded ban. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet provided specific details on when the updated ban will take effect or which countries will be added. These new restrictions are part of a series of immigration actions taken by the administration in response to recent events. Critics argue that these measures unfairly penalize individuals who have already undergone extensive vetting processes. The administration maintains that increased vetting is necessary to ensure national security. In addition to the travel ban expansion, the administration has also halted asylum decisions, paused immigration benefits for individuals from the initial 19 countries, and stopped issuing visas for Afghans who aided the U.S. war effort. Furthermore, the validity period for work permits for certain applicants, such as refugees, has been reduced, requiring more frequent reapplication and vetting.
