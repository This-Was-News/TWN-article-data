## Article summary
Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, has stated that the Gaza ceasefire is at a critical juncture as its initial phase concludes. He emphasized that the current situation is merely a pause, not a full ceasefire, which requires a complete Israeli troop withdrawal and stability in Gaza. Since the truce began in October, over 360 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, with recent violence including an Israeli airstrike that killed two Palestinians. The first phase of a U.S. peace plan involved a halt in fighting and an exchange of hostages for prisoners. However, the subsequent phase, which includes an international security force, a new Gaza government, and the disarmament of Hamas, has not yet commenced. Arab and Western officials anticipate the appointment of an international body to oversee the ceasefire by year's end. Sheikh Mohammed stressed that lasting peace requires addressing the root cause of the conflict, advocating for a Palestinian state, which is opposed by Israel's current government. Turkey's Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, raised concerns about the formation of an international security force, questioning its composition and command structure, especially given Israel's rejection of Turkish involvement. The ongoing conflict, which began with Hamas militants attacking Israel on October 7, 2023, has resulted in a significant number of Palestinian casualties, with Gaza's Health Ministry reporting over 70,000 deaths, including many women and children.
