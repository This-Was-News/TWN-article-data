## Article summary
Recent special elections suggest a potential wave of Democratic support in 2026, with Democrats outperforming previous election results by significant margins. For instance, in a Tennessee special election, Republicans won by a much smaller margin than in the previous year. This trend aligns with other elections this year where Democrats have seen double-digit overperformances. The Supreme Court's decision on redistricting in Texas, allowing a new map to move forward despite accusations of racial gerrymandering, could benefit Republicans in the House. However, Democrats are also working to redraw maps in their favor in states like California and Virginia, and may gain a seat in Utah. The economic outlook appears to be a major challenge for Republicans, with low economic confidence reported in recent polls. Many Americans, including some Trump voters, feel the cost of living is at its worst and attribute it to the current administration's policies. Trump's dismissal of affordability concerns as a Democratic "con job" may not resonate with voters experiencing these economic pressures firsthand. Tariffs are also a point of contention, with a majority of Americans, including Republicans, reporting higher prices due to them. The economic headwinds and negative views of Trump's handling of the economy are contributing factors to a notable number of Republican representatives choosing not to seek reelection.
