## Article summary
Vanity Fair is parting ways with West Coast editor Olivia Nuzzi as her contract is set to expire at the end of the year. This decision comes amidst controversy surrounding her past relationship with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the subject of a profile she wrote while she was the Washington correspondent for New York magazine. Nuzzi was previously fired by New York magazine for failing to disclose her personal relationship with Kennedy, who was a presidential candidate at the time. She detailed their relationship and the subsequent fallout in her memoir, American Canto, which was excerpted in Vanity Fair. The memoir also touched upon her relationship with ex-fiancé Ryan Lizza. Lizza publicly alleged that Nuzzi had an affair with another profile subject and provided political advice to Kennedy, both considered ethical breaches for journalists. He also shared intercepted text messages between Kennedy and Nuzzi. Nuzzi has described Lizza's posts as "fiction-slash-revenge porn." The announcement of her departure from Vanity Fair followed the release of her memoir, which received harsh criticism and did not perform well commercially, ranking low on Amazon's bestseller list. Nuzzi humorously reflected on the difficult book rollout in a Substack column, noting that Monica Lewinsky had reached out to check on her mental health.
