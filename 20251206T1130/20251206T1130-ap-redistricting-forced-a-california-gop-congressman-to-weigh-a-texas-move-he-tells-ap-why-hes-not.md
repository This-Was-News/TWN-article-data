## Article summary
California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa has explained why he chose not to move to Texas to run for Congress, despite being encouraged by Texas colleagues to consider the move. Redistricting efforts in both California and Texas, spurred by a push from President Donald Trump for Republicans to redraw lines in Texas, created a scramble for congressional seats. Issa stated that he is not giving up on California and urged other California Republicans facing difficult new districts to also stay and run. Some California GOP representatives, like Ken Calvert and Young Kim, are already set to run against each other in a newly drawn district. Issa believes that redrawing districts between censuses is unconstitutional. He considered running for Texas's 32nd District but ultimately decided to stay in California due to his deep roots there. While his decision ensures an incumbent will contest his San Diego County seat, it does not alter the landscape in Texas, where redistricting and retirements have created openings. Issa mentioned that he and other Republicans have been encouraged by the National Republican Congressional Committee to leverage the advantage of incumbency and not retire.
