## Article summary
In West Virginia, the National Guard has historically been viewed as both a patriotic duty and a vital economic resource, especially in economically struggling areas. However, recent events have led to questioning these deployments. The shooting of Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and the wounding of Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe while they were on duty near the White House as part of President Trump's National Guard deployments to American cities have brought this issue to the forefront. While the Guard offers opportunities for education, pay, and retirement benefits, which are significant in a state with limited job prospects, the rationale behind sending West Virginia National Guard members to Washington D.C. is now being scrutinized. Concerns have been raised about the legality and purpose of these deployments, with reports suggesting troops were assigned tasks like trash pickup and landscaping rather than security. This has led to criticism from Democratic lawmakers and a questioning sentiment among some West Virginians, even in a state that heavily supports President Trump. The tragic loss of Beckstrom and the injury to Wolfe have underscored the risks these service members face, prompting a deeper reflection on the necessity and wisdom of such deployments.
