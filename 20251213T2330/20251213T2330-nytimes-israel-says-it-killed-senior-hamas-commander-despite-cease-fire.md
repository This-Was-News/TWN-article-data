## Article summary
The Israeli military announced it conducted a targeted strike on a car in Gaza, killing Raed Saad, a senior commander in Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. Israel claims Mr. Saad was instrumental in planning the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that initiated the current conflict. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated he and the defense minister ordered the assassination. Mr. Saad was described by Arab intelligence officials as a longstanding member who had risen to become the armed wing's second-in-command and had operated from Hamas tunnels. Hamas has not yet officially confirmed Mr. Saad's death, but issued a statement calling the attack a "criminal breach" of the cease-fire. The strike reportedly killed four people, whose bodies were taken to Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The fate of Mr. Saad remains unclear, as Hamas often takes time to confirm the deaths of its senior figures.
