## Article summary
President Trump announced on Saturday that three Americans, including two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter, were killed in an Islamic State attack in central Syria. This marks the first American casualties in the country since the fall of Bashar al-Assad. The attack occurred in Palmyra, where the soldiers were engaged in counterterrorism operations against ISIS. A lone gunman opened fire, and Syrian security forces later killed him. Three American military personnel and two Syrian security forces members were also wounded. The wounded were evacuated to the al-Tanf U.S. base. Trump vowed "very serious retaliation" against ISIS for the attack. The incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing dangers in the region and the debate surrounding the U.S. military presence there.
