## Article summary
The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation is facing backlash from other Native Americans after a tribal business entity, KPB Services LLC, signed a nearly $30 million federal contract to design immigrant detention centers. This contract, awarded without competition, has sparked outrage, with critics viewing it as a betrayal of shared history and values, especially given the tribe's own past of forced removal by the U.S. government. Tribal leaders have stated they are attempting to withdraw from the deal, with the Tribal Council reportedly firing the economic development leaders responsible for brokering the contract. The situation highlights the economic pressures tribes face due to decreased federal funding and increased competition. Other tribes and Native American corporations are also under scrutiny for their contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including providing services and security for detention facilities. The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation's chairman acknowledged the parallels between the proposed detention centers and the historical "Indian reservations" which he described as the government's first attempts at detention centers. The contract was awarded as a sole-source agreement, raising questions about transparency and federal contracting practices. Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a retired naval officer and tribal adviser, established KPB Services LLC and has previously advised the tribe on other government contracts.
