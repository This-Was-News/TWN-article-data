## Article summary
Spain, under Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, stands out in Europe for its immigration-friendly stance, contrasting with the tougher approaches of most other European leaders. While many European nations are increasing border security and rhetoric against immigration, Sánchez champions the economic and social benefits of immigrants, arguing that an open and prosperous Spain is preferable to a closed and poor one. This approach has coincided with Spain experiencing faster economic growth than any other EU nation for two consecutive years, partly due to immigrants bolstering its aging workforce. Sánchez's government has implemented policies to facilitate residency and work permits for undocumented immigrants, aiming to fill labor shortages and sustain social benefits. Despite facing internal political challenges and criticism from far-right parties like Vox, Sánchez directly confronts anti-immigrant narratives. The government has also collaborated with the EU and African nations to curb irregular migration by sea, particularly to the Canary Islands, which has shown success in reducing arrivals. However, human rights advocates criticize Sánchez's policies, citing incidents like the 2022 Melilla clashes where migrants died. Spain's large Latin American immigrant population integrates easily due to shared language, and the country anticipates needing millions more immigrants in the coming decades to support its economy. To address concerns about housing affordability, the government plans to fund more public housing construction and potentially restrict foreign second-home purchases.
