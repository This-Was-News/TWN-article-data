## Article summary
Two U.S. service members and one U.S. civilian were killed in an ISIS attack in Palmyra, Syria. Three other service members were injured in the ambush. The attack occurred as the soldiers were concluding a key leader engagement supporting counterterrorism operations. The gunman responsible for the attack was killed by partner forces. President Trump expressed anger and vowed serious retaliation for the incident. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the U.S. will hunt down those who target Americans. This event follows the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the lifting of U.S. sanctions a year prior. CENTCOM has supported over 22 operations against ISIS in Syria since October, resulting in the deaths of five ISIS members and the capture of 19. The shooting is currently under investigation.
