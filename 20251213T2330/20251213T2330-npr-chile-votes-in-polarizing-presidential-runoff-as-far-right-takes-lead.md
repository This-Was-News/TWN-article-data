## Article summary
Chile is heading into a polarizing presidential runoff election between far-right candidate José Antonio Kast and left-wing candidate Jeannette Jara. Kast, who polls indicate is the favorite, is running on a platform emphasizing security and stricter migration policies, tapping into public fears about rising crime and an influx of Venezuelan migrants. His father was a Nazi Party member, and his brother served in Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, a legacy Kast has expressed support for, though he has downplayed these aspects in his current campaign. Jara, a former labor minister and member of the Communist Party, focuses on economic issues such as affordability, a universal basic income, and housing assistance. She is seen as a stark contrast to Kast, appealing to voters concerned about his conservative social views. The election is taking place in a context of heightened fear of crime, with homicides having increased in recent years, though recent data suggests a decrease. Illegal migration has also become a significant issue. Kast's potential victory is viewed as part of a broader regional trend of right-wing parties gaining influence. Many voters feel compelled to choose a candidate they don't fully support due to the stark differences between the two options, with mandatory voting in place.
