## Article summary
The Geminids meteor shower, known for its bright yellow streaks, is peaking tonight, offering skywatchers a spectacular display. This annual event typically features around 120 meteors per hour, visible in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, though the Northern Hemisphere will have the best view. Unlike most meteor showers originating from comets, the Geminids are believed to stem from Asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Scientists are still working to understand Phaethon, which is a small, rocky celestial body, potentially classifying it as a "dead comet" or a "rock comet." To best observe the Geminids, lie on your back outdoors with your feet facing south, allowing your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness. The meteors will be visible from Saturday evening until dawn.
