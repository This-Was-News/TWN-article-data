## Article summary
The Senate has passed a bill to end the longest government shutdown in history, which lasted 41 days. This resolution came after eight Democratic senators broke ranks and joined Republicans to support a spending package that excluded a key demand of their party: the extension of federal healthcare subsidies. The vote, 60-to-40, signals a potential end to the gridlock that furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal workers and disrupted services like food assistance and air travel. The bill now moves to the House, where its passage is uncertain due to a narrow Republican majority and strong Democratic opposition, though President Trump has indicated he will sign it. The eight Democrats who supported the bill stated they did so because Republicans refused to negotiate on healthcare while the government was shut down, and the continued closure was harming citizens. They accepted a Republican promise to hold a vote on the subsidies later, a commitment many Democrats deemed insufficient. This move has caused significant backlash within the Democratic party, with leaders like Senator Chuck Schumer criticizing the deal for not addressing the healthcare crisis. The compromise measure funds the government through January and includes provisions for retroactive pay for furloughed workers. While the healthcare subsidies remain a contentious issue, Democrats intend to continue pressuring Republicans on the matter.
