## Article summary
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has removed a long-standing boxed warning from hormone-based menopause drugs, including pills, patches, and creams containing estrogen and progestin. This warning previously alerted users to serious risks such as stroke, heart attack, and dementia. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and others argued the label was outdated and unnecessary, especially for women under 60 and within 10 years of menopause symptoms. The decision aims to encourage more personalized treatment decisions by physicians and patients, moving away from a one-size-fits-all warning that may have caused undue fear. While the FDA cited studies suggesting low risks under specific conditions, some experts expressed concern about the process, advocating for a more transparent review by independent advisers. The original warning's language will still be available to prescribers but will be placed lower on the drug label. A boxed warning remains for women who have not had a hysterectomy, regarding the risks of uterine cancer with estrogen-only therapy. Critics questioned the lack of a formal advisory panel review, suggesting it may undermine the FDA's credibility.
