## Article summary
More and more Ukrainian women are joining the military to fight Russia as the full-scale war nears its fourth year and troops remain in short supply. While women are exempt from conscription, many are volunteering for combat roles. Maryna Mytsiuk, a folklore scholar, is training rigorously to join a combat position, despite initial resistance from her family and the military. Since a 2018 law change, women can legally serve in combat positions and study all disciplines at military universities. As of January, over 70,000 women served in Ukraine's armed forces, a 40% increase since 2021. These women are now officially serving as fighter pilots, artillery commanders, drone operators, and engineers. Brigades like Khartiia and Azov are actively recruiting women, featuring them in their campaigns. Women like Yevhenia, a drone pilot, and Dasha, also a drone pilot, are serving on the front lines, facing challenges but motivated by the desire to win the war. Combat medic Olena Ivanenko, who joined the army permanently, finds a sense of belonging and purpose. Elite units, such as the sea drone operators, also include women like Xena, who, despite facing some gender biases, is focused on adapting technology to target Russian forces. The increasing presence of women in combat roles highlights their dedication to defending Ukraine, with many, like the late engineer Daria Lopatina, growing up with the conflict and feeling a strong call to serve.
