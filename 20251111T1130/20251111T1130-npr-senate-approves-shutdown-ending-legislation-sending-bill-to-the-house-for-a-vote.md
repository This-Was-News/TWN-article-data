## Article summary
The U.S. Senate has voted to approve a continuing resolution to reopen the government, ending a record-long 41-day shutdown. The measure, which passed 60 to 40, will fund much of the government through January 30 and some agencies through September 2026. This stopgap funding bill includes provisions for federal employee backpay, protections against layoffs, and full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). However, the deal does not include an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance premium subsidies, a key demand for most Democrats. Senate Republicans have agreed to hold a vote on extending these subsidies by mid-December. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives for a vote, which is not guaranteed, before it can be signed into law by President Trump. House Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated that members will be recalled to Capitol Hill with 36 hours' notice for the vote. While Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed confidence in the bill's passage, some Democrats and Republicans in the House may oppose the deal. The full-year funding measures included in the package cover agriculture, military construction, veterans affairs, and the legislative branch, but many appropriations bills still need to be passed.
