## Article summary
President Donald Trump has proposed distributing tariff revenue to Americans as $2,000 payments, which he referred to as "dividends." However, this idea faces significant challenges. Budget experts estimate that such a plan could cost far more than the revenue generated by tariffs, potentially leading to an increase in national debt rather than a decrease as Trump suggested. For instance, providing rebates to individuals earning under $100,000 annually could create a deficit of at least $100 billion. Some experts view the proposal as more of a political statement aimed at addressing public concerns about affordability and inflation rather than a well-defined policy. Adding to the confusion, White House officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have indicated that the "dividend" might not involve direct cash payments but could instead manifest as tax cuts already passed by Congress, such as eliminating taxes on tips or overtime. This contrasts with Trump's repeated assertion of direct payments. Furthermore, the administration's rhetoric about tariff revenue creates a difficult position for their legal arguments. While Trump emphasizes revenue generation, his administration's lawyers have argued before the Supreme Court that certain tariffs are regulatory in nature and not primarily intended to raise money. This inconsistency could undermine their legal defense against challenges to the tariffs' legality, which question Congress's authority to levy taxes. Ultimately, any such payment plan would require congressional authorization, which is not guaranteed.
