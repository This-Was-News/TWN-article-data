## Article summary
Families of victims in the Camp Mystic flood tragedy have filed a lawsuit alleging the camp operators failed to take necessary precautions as life-threatening floodwaters approached. The suit claims that instead of evacuating campers and counselors, a groundskeeper was directed to save equipment while those in cabins near the Guadalupe River were ordered to stay put. The lawsuit, seeking over $1 million in damages, asserts that the for-profit camp prioritized profit over safety by housing children in flood-prone areas to avoid relocation costs and neglected to create required evacuation plans. This legal action comes as Camp Mystic faces renewed criticism over plans to reopen next summer. Camp Mystic's legal counsel stated they empathize with the families but dispute the accusations, asserting the flood surge was unprecedented and warnings were inadequate. The 2023 flood tragically killed 25 girls and two counselors when the river rapidly rose, leading to questions about preparedness. The camp, established in 1926, did not evacuate during the rapid river rise. The lawsuit aims to shed light on the events and bring about justice and safety reform. The tragedy has already prompted new laws aimed at preventing future disasters.
