## Article summary
A deadly car explosion occurred near New Delhi's historic Red Fort late Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring several others. The cause of the blast, which is believed to have originated from a Hyundai i20 car, is under investigation, with authorities registering a case under anti-terrorism laws. Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed that conspirators would be brought to justice. The explosion triggered a fire that engulfed nearby vehicles and rickshaws, leaving a scene of destruction with mangled bodies and wrecked cars scattered. The National Investigation Agency, India's federal anti-terrorism body, is leading the investigation, utilizing forensic experts and reviewing camera footage. Following the incident, major train stations across India and key installations in the capital, including the international airport and metro system, were placed on high security alert. The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi advised its citizens to avoid crowds near the Red Fort and remain alert in tourist areas. The Red Fort, a 17th-century Mughal-era complex, is a major tourist attraction and a symbolic location where Indian prime ministers deliver Independence Day speeches.
