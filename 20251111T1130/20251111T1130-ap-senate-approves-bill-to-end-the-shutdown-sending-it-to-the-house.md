## Article summary
The Senate has passed legislation to reopen the government, potentially ending the 41-day shutdown, the longest in history. The bill, approved by a 60-40 vote, was ratified by a small group of Democrats despite criticism from within their party. The legislation includes provisions to reverse federal worker firings during the shutdown and ensure they are paid. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill soon, with President Trump signaling his support. The deal was reached after weeks of stalemate, with moderate Democrats eventually switching their votes as federal services were impacted. A key point of contention was the extension of health care tax credits, which Republicans had refused to negotiate on directly. While Republicans promised a vote to extend these subsidies by mid-December, there is no guarantee of success. Some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, voted against the bill, vowing to continue fighting for health care access. House Democrats also criticized the Senate's decision, viewing the deal as a betrayal of voters. The future of the health care subsidies remains uncertain, with House Speaker Mike Johnson non-committal on bringing them to a vote. Some Republicans are open to extending the credits with modifications, while others continue to call for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
