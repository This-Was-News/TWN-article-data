## Article summary
The longest government shutdown in American history, under President Trump, has been marked by unprecedentedly punishing actions. The Trump administration reduced food stamps for millions, attempted to fire government workers, and withheld back pay. Additionally, funds for projects in Democratic-led states were frozen or canceled. Despite polls indicating voters blamed Republicans more for the shutdown, Trump's tactics appear to have been effective. A group of Democrats ultimately agreed to support a bill to end the shutdown, dropping their initial demands. Senator Angus King noted that standing up to Trump did not work and instead "gave him more power." The administration's "bare-knuckle politics," often directed by budget director Russell T. Vought, proved too harsh for some centrist Senate Democrats. The eventual deal requires President Trump to rescind layoffs and restore back pay to government workers. Democrats also secured a vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies.
