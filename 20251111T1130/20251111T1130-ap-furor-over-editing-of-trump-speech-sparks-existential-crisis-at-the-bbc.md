## Article summary
The BBC is facing an "existential crisis" following the sudden resignations of two top executives over the editing of a Donald Trump speech. The flagship TV news program spliced together sections of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech, making it appear he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and "fight like hell." The BBC chairman apologized for an "error of judgment," while Trump's attorney threatened legal action, demanding a retraction and compensation. Critics argue this is the latest instance of bias at the BBC, a publicly funded broadcaster revered by some as a national treasure but criticized by others as outdated and left-leaning. Supporters, however, maintain the BBC is a trusted news source, and the executives' departure chills public-service broadcasting. An internal memo also raised concerns about the BBC's Panorama program editing Trump's speech and alleged bias in coverage of transgender issues and in its Arabic service's reporting on Israel. Prime Minister Keir Starmer supports the BBC's stance against institutional bias. The BBC, funded by a license fee, is bound by its charter to be impartial and independent, influencing public broadcasters globally. Ahead of its charter renewal, the viability of the license fee model is questioned due to declining viewership and competition from streaming services and social media.
