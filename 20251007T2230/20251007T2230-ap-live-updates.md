## Article summary
The Trump administration is threatening not to provide back pay to federal workers during the government shutdown, reversing previous policies. This move is seen as a tactic to pressure lawmakers to reopen the government, as Democrats demand an extension of health care subsidies. Meanwhile, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accuses Trump of using National Guard troops as political props, while a federal judge blocks the deployment of troops to Portland, Oregon. Other news includes the appointment of a new director for the federal immigration courts, concerns over HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s impact on public health, and ongoing legal challenges related to the deployment of National Guard troops. Additionally, the administration is facing criticism for its handling of the government shutdown and its impact on federal workers.
