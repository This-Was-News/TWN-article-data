## Article summary
President Trump suggested that furloughed federal workers may not automatically receive back pay after the government reopens, contradicting previous guidance and federal law. A draft memo from the White House indicated that only essential workers, like military personnel and air traffic controllers, would be entitled to back pay. Furloughed workers would require explicit congressional approval for any payments. Trump's comments sparked criticism from union officials and Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of using federal workers as bargaining chips. The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, signed by Trump in 2019, guarantees back pay for federal workers affected by shutdowns. The Office of Personnel Management confirmed that furloughed employees would receive retroactive pay. Senator Patty Murray emphasized that federal workers, including those furloughed, are entitled to back pay according to the law.
