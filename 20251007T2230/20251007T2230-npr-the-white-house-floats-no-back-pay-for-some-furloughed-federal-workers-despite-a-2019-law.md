## Article summary
President Trump has suggested that some of the approximately 600,000 furloughed federal workers may not receive back pay after the government reopens, despite a 2019 law designed to ensure their compensation. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump hinted at supporting a draft White House memo that argues for denying pay to certain workers. He stated that the decision depends on who is being discussed and that some people do not deserve to be taken care of. The memo's legal argument contradicts existing guidance and the 2019 law, which guarantees back pay for federal workers after a shutdown. The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 automatically applies back pay to federal employees for any lapse in appropriations starting from December 22, 2018. The White House memo argues that congressional action is required to enact back pay, despite previous guidance indicating automatic restoration of pay. The draft memo is part of a broader pressure campaign by the White House to influence Democrats during the shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged the possibility of a legal justification for the draft memo, while Senator Patty Murray criticized the move as lawless and contrary to the plain text of the law.
