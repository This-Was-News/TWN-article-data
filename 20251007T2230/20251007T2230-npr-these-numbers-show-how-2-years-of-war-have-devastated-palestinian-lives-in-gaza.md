## Article summary
The Israel-Hamas war has devastated the Gaza Strip, impacting 2.1 million Palestinians. One in ten has been killed or injured, nine are displaced, and three have gone without food. Four out of every 100 children have lost parents, and eight out of ten buildings are damaged or destroyed. The war began with a Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, leading to a punishing Israeli offensive. Cemeteries are overflowing, and entire families have been killed in their homes. Health care facilities are overwhelmed, and journalists, health workers, and U.N. aid workers face unprecedented dangers. Israel's campaign has killed over 67,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 170,000. Displacements have separated families, and Gaza's land has been transformed by destruction. Famine has been declared in Gaza City, and towns that were once agricultural are now flattened. Israel aims to take over Gaza City and free remaining hostages, while a new American peace plan is proposed.
