Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a contentious congressional hearing where Democrats accused her of politicizing the Justice Department. Bondi defended herself, claiming the Biden administration had weaponized the department. She repeatedly deflected questions about her tenure, including politically charged investigations and firings. Republicans supported Bondi, citing criminal cases against President Trump as evidence of prior politicization. Democrats criticized Bondi for eroding the department's independence and credibility. The hearing highlighted partisan divisions, with Bondi accusing Democrats of playing politics. She also referenced the murder rate in Chicago and government shutdowns. Bondi refused to discuss specific cases, such as the investigation into Trump border czar Tom Homan. Democrats expressed frustration over her lack of transparency. The hearing marked Bondi's first appearance before the panel since her confirmation, where she pledged not to play politics with the Justice Department.
