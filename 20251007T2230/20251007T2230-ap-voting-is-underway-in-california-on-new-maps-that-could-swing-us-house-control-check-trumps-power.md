## Article summary
Voting is underway in California on a ballot measure that could reshape congressional districts, potentially adding up to five Democratic seats in Congress. The outcome could influence control of the U.S. House and impact President Donald Trump's power on issues like immigration and reproductive rights. The measure is seen as a Democratic strategy to counter Trump's efforts in Texas and other states to bolster Republican control. The election has attracted significant funding and high-profile figures, with former President Barack Obama supporting the measure and former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposing it. The results could also affect the 2028 presidential contest, with Governor Gavin Newsom as a potential Democratic candidate. The measure is part of a broader national debate on redistricting, with other states like Texas and Missouri also redrawing House maps. If approved, the new map could reduce Republican-held seats in California and bolster Democratic incumbents. The proposal has sparked controversy, with Republicans accusing Democrats of a power grab. Despite Democratic advantages in registration, the election's outcome is uncertain due to voter apathy and the complex nature of the ballot measure. Campaigns are actively engaging voters, including efforts to mobilize infrequent Latino voters in the Central Valley.
