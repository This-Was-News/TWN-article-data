## Article summary
The government shutdown is causing significant disruptions in air travel across the U.S. due to staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed the delays to increased sick calls by air traffic controllers, who are concerned about working without pay. The FAA has slowed traffic at some airports to ensure safety, and delays have been reported in major cities like Newark, Denver, and Los Angeles. Politicians are blaming each other for the shutdown, which was triggered by partisan disagreements over health care subsidies. Long-standing staffing shortages in the aviation sector have been exacerbated by the shutdown, with even minor sick calls causing significant delays. The shutdown could also impact rural airports, as the Essential Air Service program may run out of funding, affecting flights in about 170 U.S. communities. The White House has proposed cutting the program's funds, despite its bipartisan support. The disruptions highlight the fragility of the aviation system and the urgent need for accelerated hiring and training of air traffic controllers. The shutdown also hampers efforts to modernize the air traffic control systems, which still rely on outdated technology.
