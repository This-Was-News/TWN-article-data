## Article summary
Attorney General Pam Bondi faced intense questioning from Democrats during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, with concerns raised about the Justice Department being weaponized to target President Trump's political enemies. Bondi defended her leadership, emphasizing her goals to end the weaponization of justice and focus on fighting violent crime. Democrats highlighted the department's changes under her tenure, including the departure of career prosecutors and the shift in investigative priorities. They criticized the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, citing it as evidence of politicization. Republicans, however, argued that the department was previously weaponized against Trump and conservatives, praising Bondi's efforts to restore its mission. The hearing revealed partisan divisions over the department's direction, with Democrats expressing alarm at the departure from traditional norms and Republicans supporting Bondi's actions. Bondi denied allegations of politicization, asserting her commitment to an independent Justice Department. The hearing also touched on the firing of top federal prosecutor Erik Siebert and the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, who secured the Comey indictment. Democrats pressed Bondi on various issues, including the closure of a probe into Tom Homan and the handling of the Epstein files, but Bondi often deflected or responded with personal attacks. The exchange between Bondi and Sen. Adam Schiff became particularly heated, with Bondi asking Schiff to apologize to Trump for his impeachment inquiry.
