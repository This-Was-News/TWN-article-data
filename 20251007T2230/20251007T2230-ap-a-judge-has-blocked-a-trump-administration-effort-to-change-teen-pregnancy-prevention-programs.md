## Article summary
A judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to modify federal teen pregnancy prevention programs, ruling that the changes were politically motivated and lacked proper analysis. The ruling supports Planned Parenthood affiliates in California, Iowa, and New York who sued to prevent enforcement of a Department of Human Services policy. The policy aimed to restrict teaching about same-sex marriage and sexual activity for minors, which the judge found contradicted congressional grant requirements. The decision affects various recipients of the funding, including nonprofits, health departments, tribes, and universities. The administration argued the changes were necessary to protect parental rights and prevent exposure to inappropriate content, but the judge disagreed, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based programming.
