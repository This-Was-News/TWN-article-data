## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments on a case involving conversion therapy, which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The practice has been widely discredited by major medical organizations and is banned in half of U.S. states for minors. The case, *Chiles v. Salazar*, challenges Colorado's ban on conversion therapy, with the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom and therapist Kaley Chiles arguing that the ban violates free speech rights. Chiles contends that she should be able to provide conversion therapy as part of talk therapy. Colorado Attorney General Philip Weiser counters that states have the right to protect patients from substandard care. Both sides have to address conflicting evidence and historical context, with opponents of the ban citing the Cass Review and supporters pointing to the evolution of medical science. A decision is expected by summer.
