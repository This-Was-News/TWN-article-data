## Article summary
The National Governors Association (NGA) is facing division as Democratic governors of California and Illinois threaten to leave due to its silence on President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops across state lines. Governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker argue that Trump's actions infringe on state sovereignty and should be condemned. Republican governors, however, have supported Trump's actions, and the NGA has not taken a position. Some Democratic governors have already left the NGA this year, citing lack of action on federal grants and state sovereignty issues. The NGA, founded in 1908, advocates for bipartisan issues but avoids partisan battles. Trump's use of executive power has caused divisions in various institutions. Democratic officials in states affected by Trump's deployments have sued, with some judges blocking the actions. The NGA's credibility is being questioned, with some governors calling for consistent application of principles. Despite the divisions, some governors remain hopeful that the NGA will continue to advocate for states' best interests.
