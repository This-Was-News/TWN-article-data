## Article summary
The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close after a daring heist on Sunday. Thieves used a basket lift and a freight elevator to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, where they stole nine priceless jewels from the collection of Napoleon and the Empress. The operation lasted just seven minutes, indicating a well-planned operation. The museum's closure caused chaos among tourists, with police securing the area. The Louvre has a history of thefts, including the famous 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa. The stolen jewels included Empress Eugénies crown, part of which was later found outside the museum. The Louvre houses over 33,000 works of art, including iconic pieces like the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The Galerie dApollon, where the theft occurred, displays a selection of the French Crown Jewels. The museum typically attracts up to 30,000 visitors daily.
