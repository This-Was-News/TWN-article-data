## Article summary
A military showcase at Camp Pendleton featuring live artillery fire over a major Southern California highway drew criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom, who cited safety concerns and closed a portion of Interstate 5. Newsom accused the President of prioritizing ego over public safety, while U.S. Marine officials assured that the exercise was routine and safe. The event, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, celebrated the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary. Republicans criticized the highway shutdown, with Rep. Darrell Issa calling it a publicity stunt. The closure caused significant traffic delays, with the highway carrying 80,000 travelers and $94 million in freight daily. Despite the controversy, no incidents related to the artillery fire were reported. Marine officials maintained that the exercise followed established safety protocols, while a spokesperson for Vance accused Newsom of misleading the public about the safety risks.
