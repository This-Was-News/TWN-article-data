## Article summary
Large crowds protested across the U.S. in 'No Kings' demonstrations against President Donald Trump, decrying perceived authoritarianism. Protesters, carrying signs like 'Nothing is more patriotic than protesting' and 'Resist Fascism,' gathered in major cities such as New York, Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago, as well as smaller public spaces. Despite the Republican Party's criticism, the events often had a street party atmosphere with marching bands, banners, and costumes. This was the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House, occurring amid a government shutdown and tensions between the executive, Congress, and the courts. Protesters, including veterans and first-time demonstrators, expressed concerns over immigration policies and military deployments in U.S. cities. In Washington, Iraq War veteran Shawn Howard highlighted the Trump administration's disregard for the law. Meanwhile, Trump dismissed the protests, and his campaign mocked them. Rallies also took place in cities like San Francisco, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Birmingham, with participants sharing messages of hope and healing. Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, joined the protests, viewing them as an antidote to Trump's actions. Republicans portrayed the protesters as far-left extremists, blaming them for the government shutdown.
