## Article summary
On October 18, 2025, the second nationwide 'No Kings' protests took place across the U.S., organized by a network of progressive groups opposing President Trump's policies. The protests, held in nearly every state, were fueled by concerns over immigration tactics, education and environmental cuts, gerrymandering, and other issues. Demonstrators gathered in major cities like Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, with a significant turnout projected. The protests emphasized themes of democracy, constitutional rights, and freedom, with participants wearing yellow to symbolize unity. Notable figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders addressed the crowds, criticizing the administration and tech billionaires. Despite Republican criticism, the protests remained largely peaceful, with no major incidents reported in key locations like New York City and Washington, D.C. Some states mobilized National Guards in preparation, but the rallies concluded without arrests. The day featured a mix of serious activism and whimsical displays, including inflatable costumes and songs from Hamilton.
