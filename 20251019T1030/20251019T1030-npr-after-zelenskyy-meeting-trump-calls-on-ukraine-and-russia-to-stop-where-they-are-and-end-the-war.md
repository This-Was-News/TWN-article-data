## Article summary
President Donald Trump, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urged both Ukraine and Russia to halt their military actions and end the war. Trump suggested that both sides should stop where they are and claim victory, allowing history to decide the outcome. This stance marks a shift from his previous positions, where he had shown growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin and expressed openness to helping Ukraine regain lost territory. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, advocated for a ceasefire and negotiations, avoiding direct comments on Trump's suggestion for Ukraine to give up land. Trump also indicated reluctance to sell Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles and preferring an end to the war. Zelenskyy expressed disappointment but noted that Trump had not ruled out the possibility of supplying the missiles. The two leaders discussed potential future talks, with Trump suggesting a 'double meeting' involving both leaders to facilitate productive negotiations. Despite Trump's assurances, Putin has shown no interest in direct talks with Zelenskyy, and Moscow has intensified its attacks on Ukraine.
