## Article summary
The article highlights the economic disparity in the United States, where wealthy Americans continue to spend freely, contributing to a resilient economy, while lower-income households struggle with high prices and a weakening labor market. In Chicago, the contrast is stark: luxury businesses thrive on the Magnificent Mile, while food pantries like the one in Pilsen see long lines of people seeking assistance. The top 10 percent of households account for nearly half of all spending, masking the financial strain on lower-income families. The pandemic briefly narrowed inequality, but recent trends show slower wage growth for low-paid workers and increased reliance on credit. Policymakers face challenges in balancing inflation control with supporting vulnerable households, as the economy's strength increasingly depends on high earners.
