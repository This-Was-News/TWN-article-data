## Article summary
President Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean will be sent back to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia. The strike, which occurred on Thursday, was the latest in a series of attacks on similar vessels since early September. Trump confirmed that two individuals were killed in the strike, bringing the total number of deaths from such actions to at least 29. The president justified the strikes by framing them as part of an armed conflict with drug cartels, invoking similar legal authority used during the war on terrorism. The repatriation of the survivors avoids potential legal questions about their status in the U.S. justice system. The vessel was reportedly carrying a significant amount of illegal narcotics, including fentanyl. Trump highlighted the operation on his social media platform, emphasizing the destruction of a large drug-carrying submarine. The military rescued the survivors after the strike, which targeted a submersible vessel navigating a known narcotrafficking route.
