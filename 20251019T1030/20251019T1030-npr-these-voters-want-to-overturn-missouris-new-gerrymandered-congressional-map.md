## Article summary
Thousands of Missouri voters gathered to protest the state legislature's efforts to redraw congressional maps in favor of the GOP and amend the initiative petition process. Leann Villaluz is among volunteers collecting signatures to put the new map to a voter referendum, expressing frustration with representatives who prioritize party interests over voter will. Missouri, along with Texas, is one of the first states to gerrymander its congressional map post-Trump's nationwide redistricting battle. The new map targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat and splits Kansas City into Republican-leaning districts. People Not Politicians Missouri aims to overturn the map if they gather over 106,000 signatures by December 11. The group faces legal challenges from state officials, including a lawsuit from Attorney General Catherine Hanaway. Despite pushback, the group claims to have gathered over 100,000 signatures and continues to collect more. The Democratic National Committee has joined the effort, contributing staff and funds. Lawmakers like Michael Davis support the new map, aiming to send a conservative message to D.C., while others, like Bill Allen, oppose mid-decade redistricting, prioritizing their district's will over party lines. Villaluz plans to continue gathering signatures, believing Missouri voters will ultimately decide the map's fate.
