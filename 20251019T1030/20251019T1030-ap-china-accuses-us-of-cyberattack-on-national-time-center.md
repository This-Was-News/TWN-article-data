## Article summary
China has accused the U.S. National Security Agency of conducting cyberattacks on its national time center. The alleged attacks, which occurred between 2022 and 2024, targeted the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand and exploited vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information from the center's staff. The U.S. agency reportedly used 42 types of cyberattack weapons to target the center's internal network systems and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system. The National Time Service Center is crucial for generating and distributing China's standard time, as well as providing timing services to various industries, including communications, finance, power, transport, and defense. China claims to have evidence of the attacks but did not provide it in the public statement. The U.S. has been accused of hyping up claims about Chinese cyber threats, which could further escalate tensions between the two countries. Western governments have previously alleged that Chinese hackers have targeted officials, journalists, corporations, and others. The U.S. Embassy has not yet commented on the accusations.
