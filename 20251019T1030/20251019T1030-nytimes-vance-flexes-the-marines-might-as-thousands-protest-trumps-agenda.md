## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance's visit to a California military base highlighted escalating tensions between federal and state authorities. Vance showcased the Marines' power by overseeing a live-fire exercise over a major freeway, which Governor Gavin Newsom criticized as dangerous and unnecessary. The event coincided with nationwide protests against President Trump's policies, illustrating the deep divisions within American society. Newsom accused Trump of authoritarianism, while Vance's aides accused Newsom of fear-mongering. The exercise was scaled back due to the dispute, and Vance used the occasion to criticize Democrats over the government shutdown. The event also sparked debate about the role of the military in domestic affairs, with some questioning the deployment of Marines for local law enforcement. Locals expressed frustration over the political spectacle amid ongoing federal worker pay issues. The overlapping events underscored the fractured state of American politics and the rising tensions between federal and state leaders.
