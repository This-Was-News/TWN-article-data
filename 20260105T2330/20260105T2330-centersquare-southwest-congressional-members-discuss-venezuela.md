## Article summary
Southwestern members of Congress have expressed divided opinions following the U.S. military's capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Republican U.S. Rep. Abe Hamadeh of Arizona lauded the Trump administration's actions, viewing Maduro as a "brutal head of a criminal drug cartel" and asserting that the decisive action protects American interests and restores order. Conversely, Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona criticized the move, stating that the President "overthrew a foreign ruler" without a clear plan and questioned the assertion that it makes Americans safer, drawing parallels to the Iraq War. Other Democrats, including Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, echoed Kelly's concerns, emphasizing the lack of Congressional authorization and questioning the administration's stated goals. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has introduced a War Powers Resolution to prevent future military actions in Venezuela without Congressional approval, a move supported by several other senators. Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, however, believes Maduro's removal is beneficial for Venezuela and the Western Hemisphere, offering a chance for democracy and prosperity. The debate highlights a partisan divide on the use of military force and presidential authority in foreign policy.
