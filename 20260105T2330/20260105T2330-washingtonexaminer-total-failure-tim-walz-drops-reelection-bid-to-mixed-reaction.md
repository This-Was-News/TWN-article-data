## Article summary
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced he is dropping his reelection bid, citing the ongoing welfare fraud scandal in the state. Walz stated that focusing on defending Minnesotans against criminals and cynics is more important than his political career. His departure has opened the door for Republican candidates, including Lisa Demuth and Kendall Qualls, who have criticized Walz's tenure and called for significant change in state government. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell also weighed in, questioning Walz's competence or suggesting he might be hiding something. YouTuber Nick Shirley claimed credit for Walz's decision, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump made critical remarks, linking Walz and other Democrats to the alleged fraud. Several Republican representatives, such as Tom Emmer and Michelle Fischbach, expressed relief and called for accountability. Conversely, Democratic representatives like Angie Craig and Tina Smith praised Walz's decision as putting the people first and expressed gratitude for his service. Senator Amy Klobuchar also supported Walz, emphasizing his dedication to his job and the state's challenges over campaigning.
