## Article summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reducing the number of vaccines routinely recommended for all children from 17 to 11. This change follows a presidential memorandum directing a review of the U.S. vaccine schedule and comparison with those in other developed countries. Vaccines previously recommended for all children, such as those for rotavirus, hepatitis A and B, meningitis, and seasonal flu, will now be restricted to high-risk individuals or require shared decision-making with a healthcare provider. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated the aim is to align the U.S. schedule with international consensus, enhance transparency, and rebuild public trust, citing declining vaccine uptake as a concern. The overhaul was based on a scientific assessment comparing U.S. policy with 20 other countries. However, the changes were made without typical public comment or input from vaccine makers, drawing criticism from some public health experts who fear it could increase doubt and put children at risk. Officials emphasized that no vaccines are being removed from availability, and they will remain free and covered by insurance through shared decision-making. The CDC and FDA are also initiating long-term placebo-controlled trials to study vaccine timing and effects.
