## Article summary
The U.S. administration has expanded its list of countries whose citizens must pay a bond to apply for a visa, with seven new nations added. This brings the total number of countries on the list to thirteen, with a majority now being African nations. The bonds range from $5,000 to $15,000 and are intended to ensure visa holders do not overstay their visas. The State Department quietly added Bhutan, Botswana, the Central African Republic, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Namibia, and Turkmenistan to this list, with the changes taking effect on January 1st. This move is part of the administration's efforts to tighten entry requirements, which also include mandatory in-person interviews and detailed social media and travel history disclosures. Officials defend the bond requirement as an effective measure. The bond is refundable if the visa is denied or if the terms are met. The newly added countries join Mauritania, Sao Tome and Principe, Tanzania, Gambia, Malawi, and Zambia, which were previously added to the list.
