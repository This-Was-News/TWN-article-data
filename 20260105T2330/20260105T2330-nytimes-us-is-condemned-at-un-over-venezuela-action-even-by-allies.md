## Article summary
Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drug charges in a Manhattan courtroom following a U.S. military raid that captured them. Maduro insisted he was still the president and had been kidnapped, declaring himself a prisoner of war rather than a criminal defendant. The U.S. military operation, which involved approximately 200 special forces members, drew criticism from international allies at an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting, who deemed it a violation of international law and the U.N. charter. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz defended the action as a law enforcement operation against a "narcotics fugitive." The charges against Maduro were revised, with the Justice Department backing off the claim that "Cartel de los Soles" is an actual organization, instead describing it as a "patronage system and a culture of corruption." Maduro's lawyer, Barry Pollack, indicated he would challenge the legality of his client's military abduction and his role as head of a sovereign government. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as interim leader, reiterating her support for Maduro. The U.S. administration briefed congressional leaders on the operation, which was conducted without prior notification to Congress, sparking debate about transparency and legality. The market reacted positively to the potential for increased Venezuelan oil output, with energy stocks rallying. The next hearing for Maduro and Flores is scheduled for March 17.
