## Article summary
The U.S. has reduced the number of vaccines it recommends for all children, a decision that has drawn criticism from leading medical groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will now recommend vaccines for 11 diseases, down from previous recommendations that included protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis, and RSV. These protections are now only recommended for specific high-risk groups or through shared decision-making with doctors. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that this overhaul aims to increase public trust by focusing on the most crucial vaccinations. President Donald Trump supported the change, calling it more reasonable and aligned with other developed nations. However, medical experts argue that this move could lead to confusion and an increase in preventable diseases, as states, not the federal government, mandate vaccinations for schoolchildren. They also point out that many high-income countries recommend more vaccines than the U.S. now does. The decision was reportedly made without input from a typical advisory committee and without public discussion or transparent review of data, raising concerns among organizations like the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. This change occurs amidst declining U.S. vaccination rates and rising rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.
