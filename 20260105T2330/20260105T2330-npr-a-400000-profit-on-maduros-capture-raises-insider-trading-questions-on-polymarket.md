## Article summary
A user on the prediction market Polymarket made over $400,000 after betting on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's capture, which occurred shortly after the bet was placed. This large profit has raised questions about potential insider trading, as the user joined the platform only weeks before the trade and has remained anonymous, changing their username. While online sleuths have been unable to identify the trader, blockchain analysis suggests they are using U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges. Experts note that while insider trading is difficult to prove on prediction markets due to a lack of clear harm, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees these platforms. However, the CFTC has fewer resources than the SEC, which polices the stock market for insider trading. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Donald Trump Jr., the son of former President Trump, advises both Polymarket and its rival Kalshi, leading to concerns about potential conflicts of interest in regulatory oversight. Unlike the Biden administration's crackdown on prediction markets, the Trump administration has been more lenient, with plans for Trump's own social media platform to launch a prediction market. This incident follows other instances of significant profits on Polymarket, such as a nearly $1 million gain on bets related to Google's most-searched terms.
