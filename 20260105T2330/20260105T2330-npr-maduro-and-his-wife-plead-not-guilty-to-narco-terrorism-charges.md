## Article summary
Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and weapons charges in a New York federal court. This marks their first court appearance since being captured in a U.S. military operation over the weekend. Maduro, who identified himself as president and a prisoner of war, and Flores, who introduced herself as first lady, were brought to the U.S. to face charges outlined in a 25-page indictment. The indictment alleges Maduro and his allies facilitated the trafficking of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S., protected by Venezuelan law enforcement and in partnership with drug cartels. If convicted, they could face life in prison. Maduro's defense requested medical attention for a potential rib injury sustained during his capture. The proceedings were overseen by U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, with the next court date set for March 17. Outside the courthouse, crowds gathered, with emotions running high among protesters both for and against Maduro's capture and the U.S. administration's actions.
