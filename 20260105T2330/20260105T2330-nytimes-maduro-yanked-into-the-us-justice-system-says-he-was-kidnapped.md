## Article summary
Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela, appeared in a Manhattan courthouse for his arraignment, pleading not guilty to federal charges of narco-terrorism and cocaine importation. Maduro declared himself a "prisoner of war," stating he was "kidnapped" and "seized by Army Delta Force commandos." He appeared in court in prison garb, blinking in the bright lights as he entered his plea. The judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein, confirmed his identity before proceeding. Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, who was also indicted and present in court with a bruised face, also pleaded not guilty. The charges against Maduro include conspiracy to import cocaine, narco-terrorism, and possessing machine guns, which carry lengthy prison sentences. His lawyer, Barry Pollack, indicated they might challenge the legality of his arrest and his status as head of a sovereign government, citing international law regarding leader immunity. The United States has not recognized Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader since the 2019 election. The indictment also names Maduro's son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, and Diosdado Cabello Rondón, among others. Outside the courthouse, protesters gathered, with some supporting Maduro and others denouncing his regime. A former political prisoner, Pedro Reyes, expressed his satisfaction at seeing Maduro in court, stating it was "small justice." As Maduro was escorted out, another former political prisoner, Pedro Rojas, confronted him, to which Maduro reiterated his claim of being a "prisoner of war."
