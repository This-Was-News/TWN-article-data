## Article summary
Deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges in a U.S. courtroom, defiantly declaring himself the president of his country. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured from their Caracas home in a military operation and brought to Manhattan Federal Court. Maduro asserted he was "captured" and a "kidnapped president," while Flores's lawyer stated she suffered injuries during their seizure. The indictment accuses Maduro and others of facilitating cocaine shipments into the U.S. and ordering violence against those involved in the drug trade. Outside the courthouse, protesters voiced opposition to the U.S. military action. The U.S. government, under President Trump, intends to temporarily run Venezuela, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested a more cautious approach to governance. Venezuela's new interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, has demanded Maduro's return but also expressed openness to collaboration with the U.S. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting, with officials warning of potential violations of international law and highlighting humanitarian needs in Venezuela. Maduro's son warned that normalizing the kidnapping of a head of state poses a global threat to political stability.
