## Article summary
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a global economic policy group, has reached an agreement with 147 countries to prevent multinational companies from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions. However, U.S.-based companies will be exempt from paying the proposed 15% global minimum tax. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent stated that this deal preserves U.S. tax sovereignty over its companies' worldwide operations and other countries' sovereignty over business within their borders. He also emphasized that the agreement protects U.S. R&D credits and incentives for investment and job creation, calling it a victory for American workers and businesses. The National Association of Manufacturers' CEO, Jay Timmons, echoed this sentiment, asserting the deal creates a level playing field and shields manufacturers from oppressive taxes. Conversely, the FACT Coalition criticized the agreement as a setback, arguing it allows large American companies to continue sheltering profits in tax havens and prioritizes corporate tax breaks over the interests of ordinary Americans and global allies.
