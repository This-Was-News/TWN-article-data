## Article summary
The capture of Nicolas Maduro has led to significant stock price increases for several American oil-related companies. Chevron saw the largest gain, with its stock rising over 5%, adding approximately $15 billion in market capitalization. Chevron is currently the only U.S. oil firm permitted to export oil from Venezuela and produces about 200,000 barrels daily. The company also has substantial interests in Guyana following its acquisition of Hess. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, both former operators in Venezuela, also experienced stock gains, with JPMorgan analysts suggesting they have a better chance of recovering assets seized in 2007. U.S. refiners, crucial for processing Venezuelan crude, also saw notable increases, with Valero up over 9% and Phillips 66 up over 7%. Oilfield service companies like Halliburton and SLB also reported gains, potentially benefiting from increased production efforts. Despite market reactions, industry sources express skepticism about long-term benefits, citing the need for political certainty, contract sanctity, and a strong rule of law in Venezuela before major investments can be considered. Analysts note that any future investments in Venezuela are long-term decisions, and companies remain hesitant without clearer political and operating conditions on the ground.
