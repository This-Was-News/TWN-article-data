## Article summary
Maryland is suing the Trump administration over the decision to move the FBI headquarters to the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington D.C. instead of Greenbelt, Maryland. Governor Wes Moore and other Maryland officials argue that the Reagan Building is too old, too small, and lacks modern security features. Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown stated that the Trump administration illegally discarded years of planning by Congress and is attempting to unlawfully reprogram over $1 billion in funds designated for the Greenbelt project. The lawsuit seeks to stop the selection of the Reagan Building, prevent the diversion of funds, and ensure the administration follows the law. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks echoed these sentiments, emphasizing that the Greenbelt site was chosen through a thorough and transparent process. Prince George's County Executive Aisha Braveboy highlighted the significant economic benefits the Greenbelt project would bring, including over 7,500 jobs and $4 billion in economic benefit. The FBI's current J. Edgar Hoover Building, built in 1975, has been criticized for its disrepair and lack of modern security. The FBI and General Services Administration announced the Reagan Building as the new location in July, citing cost and time savings compared to constructing a new building in suburban Washington.
