## Article summary
Tesla shareholders have overwhelmingly approved a massive pay package for CEO Elon Musk, with 75% of the vote supporting the measure. This package could award Musk approximately a trillion dollars in Tesla stock if he meets ambitious performance targets over the next decade, including significantly increasing the company's market capitalization to over $8.5 trillion. Musk will receive no salary but would unlock stock in tranches as specific market cap, earnings, or product sales goals are met. This decision comes after a previous $55.8 billion pay package was tied up in a court battle due to concerns about board independence. Tesla's board argues this compensation is necessary to retain Musk's leadership and incentivize extraordinary performance, despite recent reports of declining profits and Musk's involvement in other ventures. The new package, valued conservatively by Tesla's board at around $88 billion, dwarfs previous compensation awards. A key target includes the sale of one million of Tesla's Optimus robots, a project Musk sees as crucial for his future influence. If fully realized, Musk's potential earnings would far exceed the wealth of the richest individuals globally, even after accounting for luxury purchases and taxes. Critics argue the package grants excessive power and influence, while supporters highlight the performance-based nature that benefits shareholders.
