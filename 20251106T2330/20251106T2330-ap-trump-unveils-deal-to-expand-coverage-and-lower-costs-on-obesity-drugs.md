## Article summary
President Donald Trump has announced a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for their popular obesity drugs, Zepbound and Wegovy. These drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, have gained popularity but have faced access issues due to their high cost, around $500 per month for higher doses, and inconsistent insurance coverage. The agreement aims to make these treatments more accessible, particularly for the over 100 million American adults affected by obesity. Starting next year, coverage for these drugs will extend to Medicare patients for weight loss purposes, with phased-in lower prices for uninsured individuals through the TrumpRx program. The administration also announced that starting doses of new pill versions of these treatments could cost $149 per month if approved. This initiative is part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to address cost-of-living concerns and lower prescription drug prices. While the exact impact on consumer prices remains to be seen, the deal includes provisions for lower prices for Medicaid programs and a $50 copay for qualifying Medicare patients. The announcement comes amidst economic concerns influencing voters and aims to demonstrate the administration's responsiveness to these issues. Doctors highlight the significant financial struggles patients face in affording these life-changing medications, often requiring them to take on extra work or delay retirement.
