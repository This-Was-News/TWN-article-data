## Article summary
U.S. airlines are canceling hundreds of flights due to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) order to reduce air traffic at the nation's busiest airports, a measure implemented because of the ongoing government shutdown. The FAA mandated a 10% reduction in flight schedules at 40 high-volume airports, including those in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, to maintain safety amidst signs of strain among air traffic controllers who are working without pay. This order impacts travel at many smaller airports as well, with airlines beginning to phase in the cuts. Major carriers like Delta, United, and American Airlines have already canceled a significant number of flights, and the disruptions are expected to continue indefinitely until safety data improves. Travelers are facing uncertainty, with many changing plans or seeking alternative options, especially with the busy holiday season approaching. The FAA's decision aims to alleviate pressure on air traffic controllers, many of whom are taking sick days due to financial hardship caused by the shutdown. Airlines are offering refunds to passengers who choose not to fly, and some are advising travelers to purchase backup tickets. The reductions could affect up to 1,800 flights and over 268,000 passengers daily, also potentially disrupting package deliveries from airports with major distribution centers. The situation is described as damaging confidence in the U.S. air travel experience, with staffing shortages becoming increasingly apparent.
