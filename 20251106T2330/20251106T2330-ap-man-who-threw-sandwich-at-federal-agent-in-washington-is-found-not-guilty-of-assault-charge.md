## Article summary
A former Justice Department employee, Sean Charles Dunn, was found not guilty of assaulting a federal agent after throwing a sandwich at him during a protest against federal law enforcement presence in Washington. The incident, captured on viral video, made Dunn a symbol of resistance to the deployment of federal agents. This acquittal marks another setback for prosecutors who faced criticism for their charging tactics during the intervention. Dunn's lawyers successfully argued that the sandwich throwing was a protected act of protest under the First Amendment, despite prosecutors claiming he knew he lacked the right to do so. Dunn had shouted anti-government slogans during the confrontation. Following the verdict, Dunn expressed relief and a desire to move forward with his life. The U.S. Attorney's office stated they accept the jury's verdict but emphasized that law enforcement should not be subjected to assault. Dunn had been fired from his Justice Department job after his arrest, with officials referring to him as an example of the 'Deep State.' His lawyers argued he was targeted for his political speech, citing White House and Justice Department posts. Dunn stated he acted to protect immigrants' rights, emphasizing the principle of 'e pluribus unum' and the right to a free life for all. His defense team viewed the verdict as an affirmation that dissent is not only tolerated but legal and welcome. The federal agent testified the sandwich hit his chest with enough force to be felt through his ballistic vest.
