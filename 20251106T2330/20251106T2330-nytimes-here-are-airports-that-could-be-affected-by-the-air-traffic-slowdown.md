## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is planning to reduce air traffic by up to 10 percent starting Friday, with cuts deepening over the weekend. While the administration has not publicly released a list of the 40 affected airports, preliminary information has been shared with airlines. The reductions are expected to focus on locations with the highest air traffic. Initially, a 4 percent reduction is anticipated on Friday, escalating to 10 percent by the weekend. The FAA's Core 30 list, comprising the nation's busiest airports, is a primary focus, along with high-traffic cargo hubs and airports frequently used by private jets. Factors such as traffic volume, location, and the strain on local air traffic controller staffing shortages are also being considered. Air traffic controllers are already working overtime due to severe staffing shortages and will now be working without pay during the shutdown. The document lists the 30 busiest airports and several other potential candidates for flight reductions. These include major metropolitan hubs like Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Los Angeles International, and Chicago O'Hare International, as well as airports such as Anchorage International, Dallas Love Field, and Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.
