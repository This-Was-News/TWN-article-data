## Article summary
President Trump announced a deal with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to significantly lower the prices of popular obesity drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. The agreements aim to make these medications more accessible and affordable for millions of Americans, with potential prices as low as $149 a month for pill forms and an average of $350 a month for injectable versions. Medicare and Medicaid will also see reduced costs for these drugs starting mid-next year, though coverage will still be limited to individuals meeting specific medical criteria. This initiative is part of Trump's broader effort to reduce prescription drug costs, and the companies have also secured a three-year reprieve from tariffs as part of the deal. The drugs, shown to be effective for weight management and reducing cardiovascular risks, have historically been out of reach for many due to high costs and limited insurance coverage. The administration projects a collective weight loss of 135 million pounds among Americans by the midterm elections. The announcement occurred during the ongoing government shutdown, with Democrats seeking to extend Obamacare subsidies. The deal also includes lower direct-to-consumer prices for other medications like migraine treatments and insulin. Despite the new pricing, federal law still presents barriers to coverage for weight-loss drugs within Medicare and Medicaid programs. The initiative aims to create a new website, TrumpRx.gov, to direct patients to manufacturer websites for purchasing these medications.
