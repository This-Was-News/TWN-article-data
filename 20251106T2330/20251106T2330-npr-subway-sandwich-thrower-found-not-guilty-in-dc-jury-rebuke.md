## Article summary
A jury found Sean Charles Dunn not guilty of assaulting a federal officer for throwing a Subway sandwich at an agent in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred in August 2025 during a federal law enforcement deployment to the city. Dunn was captured on video calling the officers "racists and fascists" and believed they were preparing for an immigration raid. He then threw his sandwich, which exploded on the agent, though the agent was unharmed. The case was initially considered for a felony assault charge but was later downgraded to a misdemeanor. Dunn's defense argued he was being targeted for his criticism of the Trump administration and that the act was harmless. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before reaching their verdict. Dunn expressed relief and a desire to move on with his life after the acquittal.
