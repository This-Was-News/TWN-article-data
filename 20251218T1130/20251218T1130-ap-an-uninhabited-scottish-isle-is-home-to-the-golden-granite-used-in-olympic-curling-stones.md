## Article summary
Ailsa Craig, an uninhabited Scottish isle, is the exclusive source of the unique golden and blue hone granite used to craft Olympic curling stones. The company Kays Curling holds the sole license to harvest this super-dense granite, which is crucial for the sport due to its durability and elasticity. This granite's properties allow the stones to withstand collisions without splitting and its waterproof nature makes the blue hone ideal for the running surface. Kays Curling has a long-standing relationship with the Olympics, having supplied stones for every Winter Games since curling became an official medal sport in 1998. The process of harvesting the granite involves carefully selecting boulders with tight surface patterns, with the common green granite falling naturally and the blue hone requiring careful extraction from cliff faces. Once harvested, the boulders are transported, sliced, and shaped into the distinctive curling stones, which weigh around 42 pounds each. The island itself is protected to preserve its natural habitat for Gannets and seals, with measures in place to prevent the reintroduction of rodents. Curling, a sport with roots in Scotland dating back to 1540, is experiencing growing popularity, particularly in Asia, and is set to launch its first professional league, The Rock League, following the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.
