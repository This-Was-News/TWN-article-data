## Article summary
The word 'affordability' has become a central theme in contemporary politics, frequently used by both Democrats and Republicans to appeal to voters. Democrats have significantly increased their use of the term, viewing it as a decisive issue. Donald Trump initially capitalized on affordability promises to win the presidency, but his stance has become more conflicted, sometimes embracing it and other times dismissing it as a Democratic "con job." Historically, 'affordable' was often associated with lower-income issues or suggested inferior quality. However, through marketing strategies like "affordable luxury" and policy shifts, particularly in housing and healthcare, the term was reframed to resonate with middle-class concerns. The rising costs of essentials like housing and healthcare have made affordability a pressing issue for a broader segment of the population. Voters are increasingly focused on their personal financial experiences rather than general economic indicators. While politicians can promise lower prices, the reality of inflation and wage adjustments makes it difficult to satisfy voters' concerns about the cost of living. The current appeal of 'affordability' extends beyond everyday prices, encompassing a broader frustration with the basic feasibility of maintaining a comfortable life, including costs for education, childcare, and energy. For many voters, 'affordability' now directly reflects their own financial struggles.
