## Article summary
President Trump claimed economic successes during a White House address, but a fact-check reveals several misleading statements. His assertion that inflation was the worst in 48 years when he took office is false; inflation had already fallen. While he stated turkey prices were down 33 percent, this was an exaggeration, and wholesale prices had actually risen. He was correct that egg prices had fallen significantly, but incorrect that all prices were rapidly declining, as the Consumer Price Index rose. His claim about gasoline prices being under $2.50 a gallon nationally was also exaggerated, with averages closer to $2.90. The president's stated $18 trillion in investment secured is nearly double his own White House's tally and includes unrealistic pledges. Finally, his description of a new bill offering tax breaks on tips, overtime, and Social Security for seniors was exaggerated, as these breaks are temporary, capped, and not fully inclusive for all seniors.
