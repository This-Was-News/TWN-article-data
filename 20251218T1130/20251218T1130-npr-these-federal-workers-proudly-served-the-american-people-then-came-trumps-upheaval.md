## Article summary
Under the Trump administration, the federal workforce experienced significant upheaval, leading to the departure of approximately 317,000 employees by the end of 2025. This exodus resulted from a combination of firings, buyout offers, and a climate of uncertainty and chaos. Many federal workers, like Liz Goggin, found the new working conditions untenable due to mandates such as weekly accomplishment reports and directives to report perceived anti-Christian bias. The administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives also created confusion and low morale. Mahri Stainnak, who worked in DEI, was fired shortly after President Trump's inauguration and is now part of a class-action lawsuit alleging illegal discrimination. Stainnak highlights the personal financial struggles faced after losing their job and health insurance. Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, warns that Trump's actions are dismantling government institutions and reverting the country to a patronage system reminiscent of the 1800s. Keri Murphy, another federal employee, was fired despite receiving an award for outstanding performance, and while a court found the mass firing of probationary employees illegal, reinstatement was not ordered. Despite the challenges, some former federal employees, like Goggin, have found success in the private sector but still express a sense of loss and a wistful desire to return to public service, though not under the current administration.
