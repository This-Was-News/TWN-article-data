## Article summary
Enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans are set to expire at the end of the year, potentially doubling or tripling premiums for millions of Americans. Despite broad public support for extending these subsidies, Congress is heading for a holiday recess without a solution, as partisan divisions and ongoing debates over healthcare reform stall progress. While some bipartisan efforts have been made to advance measures extending the subsidies, only partisan proposals have come to a vote, and both have failed. House Speaker Mike Johnson has introduced a package of health reforms favored by conservatives, but it does not include an extension of the expiring subsidies. Democrats are pushing for a standalone, three-year extension, while some Republicans, like Senator Bill Cassidy, advocate for alternative solutions such as health savings accounts. The debate over the ACA, which has been a contentious issue for 15 years, continues to be a significant factor in political discussions, with implications for upcoming elections. Some Republicans acknowledge the ACA's deep integration into the healthcare system, moving from a "Repeal and Replace" stance to "Reduce and Repair." The expiration of subsidies is a pressing concern for many, particularly those in competitive districts and rural areas, highlighting the personal impact of healthcare costs on constituents. As lawmakers depart for recess, the urgency to address the impending premium hikes for ACA enrollees intensifies, with time running out for a legislative deal.
