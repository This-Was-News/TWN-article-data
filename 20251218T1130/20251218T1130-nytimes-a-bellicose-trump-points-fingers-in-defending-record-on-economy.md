## Article summary
President Trump delivered an 18-minute speech defending his economic accomplishments during his first year in office, arguing that the promised "Golden Age" was gaining momentum. The speech largely consisted of familiar talking points, interspersed with exaggerations and misleading statements. Notably, Trump omitted his recent claims that affordability was a "hoax" orchestrated by Democrats, a statement that had reportedly made his own advisors uncomfortable. His tone throughout the speech was combative and fast-paced, resembling his typical free-association style rather than a structured address. He began by blaming former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., stating, "I inherited a mess," and described a country plagued by illegal immigration, a weakened manufacturing base, and crime, all of which he claimed to have solved. Trump vowed further economic relief for citizens, promising fatter paychecks. However, his angry tone seemed to overshadow his message, potentially indicating pressure to demonstrate results quickly and counter a narrative of economic mismanagement. The speech aimed to solidify his economic record before a negative perception could take hold.
