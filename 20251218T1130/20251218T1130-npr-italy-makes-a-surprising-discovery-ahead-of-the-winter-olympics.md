## Article summary
Thousands of dinosaur tracks, estimated to be 210 million years old, have been discovered on nearly vertical dolomite walls in Stelvio National Park in northern Italy. This significant find, located between the towns of Livigno and Bormio, areas that will host events for the 2026 Winter Olympics, has been hailed as the largest and one of the richest dinosaur track sites in the Alps. The prints, preserved in excellent condition, date back to the Late Triassic period and are believed to be from herbivorous prosauropod dinosaurs. This discovery marks the first dinosaur tracks found in the Lombardy region and the only ones discovered north of the Insubric Line. The tracks were found by nature photographer Elio Della Ferrara, who scaled a 2,000-foot rock wall to observe them. Scientists believe the area was once tidal flats where these dinosaurs roamed. While many prosauropod fossils have been found globally, much remains unknown about them, and Italian officials hope this discovery will provide new insights. Due to the inaccessibility of the site, researchers will utilize drones and remote sensing technologies for further study. The area is not expected to be open to the public soon, but the discovery adds a fascinating prehistoric layer to the Olympic landscape.
