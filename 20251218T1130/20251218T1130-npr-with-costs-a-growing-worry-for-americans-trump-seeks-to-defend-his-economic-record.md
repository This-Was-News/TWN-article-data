## Article summary
President Trump, facing growing voter anxiety over costs, defended his economic record in a primetime address, largely restating familiar messages. He blamed current economic problems on Joe Biden and claimed his own administration has been a massive success, asserting that more positive change has been brought to Washington than by any previous administration. Trump announced a "special warrior dividend" of $1,776 for nearly 1.5 million military service members, to be distributed before Christmas. This address comes as his economic approval rating has hit a low of 36%, with the cost of living being the top concern for 45% of Americans. Despite evidence that his tariffs are driving up prices, Trump continued to promote them as a key economic accomplishment. He also teased future "aggressive housing reform plans" and promised tax refunds from his "big, beautiful bill" next year. Trump's focus on economic issues follows the Democrats' success in recent off-year elections, attributed to their focus on affordability. He has been actively campaigning, making his economic case to supporters and promoting initiatives like "Trump accounts." The President is scheduled to deliver another speech in North Carolina on Friday.
