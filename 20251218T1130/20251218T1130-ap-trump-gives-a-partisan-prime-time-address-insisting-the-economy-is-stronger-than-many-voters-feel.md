## Article summary
President Donald Trump delivered a prime-time address, framing it as a report on his administration's economic achievements while blaming Democrats for current challenges. He announced a $1,776 bonus check for U.S. troops, funded by tariffs, which he claimed would alleviate financial strains. The speech, delivered from the White House, aimed to counter public anxiety about the economy, particularly rising costs of goods and a weakening job market. Trump insisted the economy was on an upward trajectory, citing job growth and investment, despite public sentiment reflecting frustration with inflation. He contrasted his administration's performance with that of his predecessor, Joe Biden, whom he blamed for inheriting a "mess." The address, more partisan than typical presidential speeches, occurred as Trump seeks to regain popularity ahead of midterm elections. While the stock market and gasoline prices have seen some positive movement, inflation has reaccelerated following Trump's imposition of tariffs. The speech also touched on other policy areas, including immigration and healthcare premiums. Despite assurances from aides that the speech was well-received, public perception of the economy remains a significant challenge for Trump.
