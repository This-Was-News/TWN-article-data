## Article summary
Western officials allege that Russia is orchestrating a widespread sabotage campaign across Europe, aiming to deplete the continent's security resources and sow division. This campaign, which intensified after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, involves incidents ranging from train derailments and arson to cyberattacks and vandalism. While these acts often result in minimal physical damage, they significantly strain European intelligence and law enforcement agencies, consuming resources that could be directed elsewhere. Officials note that these operations are cost-effective for Russia, often utilizing foreign proxies with criminal backgrounds, thus minimizing the risk to Russian operatives. The Associated Press has documented over 145 such incidents, with a notable increase in arson and explosives plots. Countries bordering Russia, such as Poland and Estonia, are frequently targeted, as are nations that are strong supporters of Ukraine. The campaign appears to have paused briefly in late 2024 and early 2025, possibly to gauge the U.S. administration, but has since resumed. Russia denies any involvement in these sabotage efforts. Despite the strain, the coordinated nature of these attacks has also fostered increased cooperation among European security services and NATO allies, leading to joint investigation teams and enhanced training for frontline officers to identify potential state-backed incidents. However, officials caution that Russia continues to evolve its methods, posing an ongoing threat.
