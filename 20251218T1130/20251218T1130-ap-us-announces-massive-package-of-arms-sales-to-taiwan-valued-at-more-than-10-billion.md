## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced a significant arms sale package to Taiwan, valued at over $10 billion. This package includes medium-range missiles, howitzers, and drones, which would be the largest U.S. weapons deal to Taiwan if approved by Congress. The State Department announced the sales, which aim to support Taiwan's modernization of its armed forces and defensive capabilities. China has strongly condemned the move, calling it a violation of diplomatic agreements and a threat to regional stability, warning that it could lead to military confrontation. Taiwan's Defense Ministry expressed gratitude, stating the sales will bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. This arms sale comes as Taiwan plans to increase its defense spending significantly. The U.S. is legally obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point of contention with China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory. The proposed sales are part of a broader legislative push by the U.S. to support Taiwan's security.
