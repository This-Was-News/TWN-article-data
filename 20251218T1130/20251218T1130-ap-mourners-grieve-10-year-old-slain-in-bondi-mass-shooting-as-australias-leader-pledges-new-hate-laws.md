## Article summary
Hundreds of mourners gathered in Sydney for the funeral of a 10-year-old girl, Matilda, who was killed in a mass shooting at Bondi Beach during a Hanukkah celebration. The attack, which targeted Jews, resulted in the deaths of 15 people and was reportedly inspired by the Islamic State group. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced plans for new hate speech laws aimed at curbing radicalization and strengthening punishments for promoting violence. These proposed laws would broaden the definition of hate speech offenses, allow for the designation of hateful groups, and give officials more power to reject or cancel visas for individuals who spread hate. The announcement followed pledges to tighten gun controls and implement stricter rules for protests. Meanwhile, investigators are probing the suspected shooters' links and travel, with the younger suspect, Naveed Akram, facing multiple charges including murder and committing a terrorist act. The older shooter, Sajid Akram, had legally acquired the weapons used in the attack. The funerals have highlighted the grief within Sydney's Jewish community, with tributes remembering the victims' lives, including Matilda, described as a 'little ray of sunshine,' and Alex Kleytman, an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor.
