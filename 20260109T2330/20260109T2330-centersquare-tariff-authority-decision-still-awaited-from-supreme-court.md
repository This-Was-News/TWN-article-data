## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to issue a decision on President Donald Trump's tariff authority, meaning the federal government continues to collect the revenue. Businesses worldwide were anticipating a ruling, but the court released an unrelated opinion instead, with the tariff decision expected by the end of June. Trump has utilized tariffs extensively, imposing import taxes on all U.S. trading partners and subsequently adjusting them under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. A coalition of states and small businesses challenged these tariffs, initially winning in lower courts before the administration appealed to the Supreme Court. The case's expedited review by the high court highlights its significant economic implications, as a ruling against the administration could force the refund of over $133.5 billion in tariffs to importers. Trump has deemed the case critically important, warning of potential economic ruin for the U.S. if the ruling is unfavorable, while businesses report that tariffs have increased consumer prices.
