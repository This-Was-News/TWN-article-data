## Article summary
The U.S. economy experienced a significant slowdown in job growth during President Trump's first year back in office, with only 584,000 jobs added over the past 12 months, the slowest pace since 2020. This figure is considerably lower than the over 2 million jobs created in the final year of President Biden's term. The decline in hiring is attributed to a steep slowdown in immigration, exacerbated by mass deportations initiated under Trump's administration. The unemployment rate also rose to 4.4 percent, with fewer job openings and smaller raises offered to workers. Job growth was concentrated in healthcare, while manufacturing saw job losses. Economists suggest that Trump's agenda, including deregulation, tax cuts, tariffs, and border enforcement, may be contributing to these economic strains. Despite public dissatisfaction with the economy, the White House is actively promoting a narrative of continued growth ahead of the midterm elections. A controversy arose when President Trump posted preliminary jobs data on social media before its official release, prompting an review of White House protocols. While some aides express optimism about future growth, citing productivity gains, others acknowledge the puzzling nature of the current economic indicators.
