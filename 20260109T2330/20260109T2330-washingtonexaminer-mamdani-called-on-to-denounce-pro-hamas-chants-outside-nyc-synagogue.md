## Article summary
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani is facing criticism for his silence on anti-Israel protesters chanting support for Hamas outside a Queens synagogue. Video footage showed masked individuals waving Palestinian flags and holding signs with anti-Israel messages, while pro-Israel demonstrators held a counter-protest across the street. Several political figures, including State Representative Sam Berger and Governor Kathy Hochul, have publicly denounced the chants as antisemitic and dangerous. Berger specifically called on Mamdani to condemn the incident, referencing the mayor's past commitment to fighting antisemitism. Hochul condemned the rhetoric, stating that Hamas is a terrorist organization and such chants have no place in New York. The NYPD maintained a safety perimeter during the protest, which led to the early closure of nearby schools and a house of worship. Other Democrats, such as former Comptroller Brad Lander and Senator John Fetterman, also condemned the protest. Actor Michael Rapaport criticized Mamdani for his lack of immediate response and urged Governor Hochul to resign for not banning masks in public. Rapaport also warned of dangerous consequences if antisemitism is tolerated in the city, referencing a recent attack in Sydney, Australia.
