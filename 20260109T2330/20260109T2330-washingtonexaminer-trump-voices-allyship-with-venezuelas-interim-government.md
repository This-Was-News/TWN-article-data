## Article summary
President Donald Trump expressed confidence in Venezuela's interim government, led by acting President Delcy Rodriguez, stating they appear to be an ally of the United States. This endorsement comes despite criticism for not immediately backing opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. Trumps decision to support Rodriguez was based on her perceived friendlier posture towards his administration and US interests in Venezuela's oil. The interim government has begun releasing political prisoners and agreed to provide oil, which Trump views positively. Trump also defended his decision to capture former dictator Nicolas Maduro, aiming to prevent increased influence from China and Russia in Venezuela. Machado is scheduled to visit Trump, and he indicated she might play a role in Venezuela's future government. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined a plan for Venezuela involving stabilization and reconciliation before new elections. When asked about prioritizing stability or democracy, Trump stated he seeks both, ultimately aiming for democracy.
