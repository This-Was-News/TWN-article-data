## Article summary
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced intensified efforts by the Treasury Department and the IRS to combat massive social services fraud in Minnesota, which is now estimated to be around $9 billion. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the IRS are investigating money service businesses suspected of funneling stolen social services funds overseas, potentially to groups like al-Shabaab. FinCEN has implemented a geographic targeting order in the Twin Cities to enhance financial reporting and detect fraudulent activity. The IRS is auditing financial institutions involved in laundering these funds and establishing a new task force to investigate pandemic-era tax incentive abuse and misuse of nonprofit status. The Treasury Department is also providing fraud prevention training to Minnesota law enforcement. The Justice Department is conducting its own investigations, and federal social services funding has been frozen for Minnesota, California, Colorado, Illinois, and New York. Bessent indicated that similar investigations are expected in other states, stating that the Minnesota situation will serve as a model for future probes. The administration aims to recover funds, hold perpetrators accountable, and ensure federal aid reaches its intended recipients.
