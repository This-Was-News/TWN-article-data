## Article summary
President Donald Trump met with oil executives at the White House to discuss securing $100 billion in investments to revive Venezuela's oil industry, though no commitments were made by the companies, with some CEOs deeming Venezuela currently uninvestable. Concurrently, U.S. forces intercepted a fifth sanctioned oil tanker bound for Venezuela as part of the administration's efforts to control global oil distribution. In other news, the Senate advanced a resolution to limit Trump's military actions against Venezuela, indicating unease among some Republicans. Envoys from Denmark and Greenland met with White House officials regarding Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland. The U.S. also sent a delegation to Venezuela to assess the potential reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, signaling a possible restoration of diplomatic relations. Trump announced plans to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds to lower rates and stated he would meet with Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado. Meanwhile, Iran's judiciary vowed decisive punishment for protesters amid ongoing demonstrations. The U.S. also saw subdued job growth in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 4.4%. Finally, Mexico's president requested dialogue with the U.S. following Trump's comments on potential ground attacks against drug cartels.
