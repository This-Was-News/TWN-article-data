## Article summary
A use-of-force review board has cleared Ohio police officer Connor Grubb, who fatally shot 21-year-old Ta'Kiya Young and her unborn child on August 24, 2023. The board, convened by Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford, found that Grubb did not violate department policy during the incident in a Kroger parking lot. This decision follows a Franklin County jury's acquittal of Grubb on all charges, including murder and manslaughter, in November 2025. The review board's findings were met with criticism from Sean Walton, an attorney for Young's family, who called the department's policies a danger and stated that Grubb chose escalation over de-escalation. Bodycam footage showed Grubb and another officer approaching Young's car based on a suspected shoplifting report. After Young partially lowered her window and protested, she put on her turn signal and her car moved forward slowly. Grubb then fired a single shot through the windshield, hitting her in the chest. Grubb stated he felt the vehicle hit his legs and shins and begin to lift him before he fired. Young and her unborn daughter were pronounced dead at a hospital. Grubb had been placed on paid administrative leave following the shooting.
