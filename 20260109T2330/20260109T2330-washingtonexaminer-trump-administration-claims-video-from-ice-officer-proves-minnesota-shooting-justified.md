## Article summary
The Trump administration claims that newly released cellphone video from an ICE officer proves he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Renee Good. Vice President JD Vance and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the footage shows Good endangered the officer's life by striking his SUV before he fired. A federal investigation is underway, with public debate focusing on whether the use of lethal force was justified. Some, including Rep. Mike Lawler, argue the shooting was warranted because Good failed to comply and drove toward officers. Conversely, critics question the officer's claim of self-defense, pointing to his expletive-laden reaction after the shooting and suggesting Good may have been trying to avoid hitting officers. They also question why the officer held onto his cellphone during the encounter. Online commentary suggests both parties may have contributed to escalating the confrontation, and some believe the officer acted out of anger rather than self-defense, citing other evidence that contradicts the self-defense narrative.
