## Article summary
A federal court has ordered Colorado to pay $5.4 million in legal fees to the nonprofit Becket after the state's law banning abortion pill reversals was blocked. The law, enacted in 2023, made it unprofessional conduct for healthcare providers to prescribe medications for women seeking to reverse the effects of abortion drugs. Becket represented Bella Health and Wellness, a Denver-area crisis pregnancy center, in its lawsuit against the state. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against the law in October 2023 and a permanent injunction two years later, citing First Amendment rights. The court found that the state failed to show a compelling interest in regulating the practice, noting that no one had been injured by the treatment and several women had successfully given birth after receiving it. This ruling struck down Colorado's ban, the first of its kind in the nation, ensuring clinics can continue offering abortion pill reversals. Becket stated that 18 babies have been born due to this treatment provided by Bella Health and Wellness during the litigation period alone.
