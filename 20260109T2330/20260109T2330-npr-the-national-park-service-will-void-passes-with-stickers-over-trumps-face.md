## Article summary
The National Park Service has updated its policy stating that passes may be voided if defaced or altered, following a backlash against the inclusion of President Trump's image on the 2026 "America the Beautiful" annual pass. This year's pass features side-by-side portraits of Presidents George Washington and Trump, deviating from the usual nature-themed designs selected through a photo contest. In response, many parkgoers have covered Trump's image with stickers of wildlife, landscapes, or smiley faces, leading to a growing sticker campaign where proceeds benefit conservation nonprofits. The Interior Department clarified that passes have always been void if altered, and the update aims to clarify this rule for staff and visitors. However, the updated guidance now explicitly includes stickers or markings on the front of the card, leaving it to park officials' discretion to determine if a pass is "defaced." A conservation group has filed a lawsuit, arguing the pass design violates federal requirements and is part of a pattern of "Trump branding." The lawsuit seeks to replace the current design with the contest winner and prevent presidents' faces from appearing on future passes. While some defend the design as a tribute to the nation's 250th birthday, others criticize it as self-glorification and a politicization of public lands.
