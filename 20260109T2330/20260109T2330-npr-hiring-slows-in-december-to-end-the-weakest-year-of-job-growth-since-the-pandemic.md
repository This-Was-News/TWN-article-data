## Article summary
In December 2025, U.S. employers added only 50,000 jobs, marking the slowest annual job growth since the pandemic began in 2020. The total job gains for 2025 reached 584,000, a significant drop from the 2 million jobs added in 2024. Despite the slowdown, the unemployment rate decreased to 4.4% in December. Job gains for previous months were also revised downward, further highlighting the weakening trend. Industries like healthcare and hospitality saw job additions, while manufacturing continued to decline, losing 8,000 jobs in December due to tariffs and rising component costs. The federal government, though adding 2,000 jobs in December, remains significantly down from the start of the year. Worker confidence in job security has decreased, leading to reluctance to leave existing positions and fewer opportunities for job seekers. This economic slowdown prompted the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate for the third time since September.
