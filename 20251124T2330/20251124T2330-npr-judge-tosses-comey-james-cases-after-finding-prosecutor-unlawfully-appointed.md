## Article summary
A federal judge has dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The judge ruled that Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney who secured the indictments, was unlawfully appointed. This decision is a significant setback for efforts targeting perceived political enemies of the president. The judge stated that all actions stemming from Halligan's defective appointment were unlawful and set aside. The cases were dismissed without prejudice, allowing the Justice Department to potentially refile them. The White House disagrees with the ruling, calling it an unprecedented action to shield Comey and James from accountability. Halligan, a former personal lawyer for the president with no prior prosecutorial experience, was appointed after the previous prosecutor expressed doubts about the cases. Comey expressed gratitude that the case against him was dismissed, calling it a prosecution based on malevolence. His attorney stated that the indictment is void and a new one cannot be brought due to the statute of limitations. Halligan also secured an indictment against James on bank fraud and false statements charges, which she has pleaded not guilty to. James's attorney argued that the president took extreme measures to substitute an ally to bring baseless charges.
