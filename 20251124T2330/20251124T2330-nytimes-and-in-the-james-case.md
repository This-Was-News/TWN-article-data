## Article summary
A federal judge has dismissed the criminal charges against Letitia James, New York's attorney general, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was illegally appointed. The judge found that Halligan's appointment as Interim U.S. Attorney violated federal statute 28 U.S.C. § 546, which limits the Attorney General's appointment power to 120 days. After this period, the authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney shifts to the district court. Halligan, appointed by the Attorney General after the 120-day limit had passed, lacked the lawful authority to secure the indictment against James. The court also determined that Halligan's appointment violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause, which dictates the exclusive means of appointing federal officers. The judge rejected the government's arguments regarding the de facto officer doctrine and harmless error, stating that such challenges are valid when the Appointments Clause is violated. The indictment was dismissed without prejudice, meaning the charges could potentially be refiled if James is indicted by a properly appointed prosecutor. The ruling emphasizes the importance of the Appointments Clause as a structural safeguard of the Constitution and aims to deter future unlawful appointments.
