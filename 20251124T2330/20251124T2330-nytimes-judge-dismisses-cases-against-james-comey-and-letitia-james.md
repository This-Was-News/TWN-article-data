## Article summary
A federal judge has dismissed criminal charges against former F.B.I. director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled that the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, who brought the charges, was appointed unlawfully by President Trump. This decision represents a significant setback for the president's efforts to use the justice system against perceived opponents. The rulings were based on the illegal appointment of two interim prosecutors in succession, which circumvents the Senate confirmation process. While the dismissals are a rebuke to Attorney General Pam Bondi and the White House, they were made without prejudice, leaving open the possibility of refiling the charges. The administration has signaled its intent to appeal the judge's decision. Lawyers for both Mr. Comey and Ms. James hailed the ruling as a vindication of the legal system and a victory against politically motivated targeting. The statute of limitations for Mr. Comey's case is also a point of contention, with his lawyers arguing it has expired. This case is part of a broader pattern where other federal judges have found similar appointment maneuvers by the Trump administration to be unlawful.
