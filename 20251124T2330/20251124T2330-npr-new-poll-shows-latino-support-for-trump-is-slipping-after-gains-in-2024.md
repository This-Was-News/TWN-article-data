## Article summary
A recent Pew Research Center poll indicates a significant decline in Latino support for President Trump. While Trump achieved unprecedented gains with Latino voters in 2024, the survey of over 5,000 Latinos reveals that majorities now disapprove of his performance. Specifically, 70% disapprove of his job as president, with 55% strongly disapproving. This marks a 12-point drop among those who previously voted for him. The economy is a primary concern, with 78% viewing current economic conditions negatively and blaming Trump's policies for making them worse. Half of respondents reported struggling to afford basic necessities like food, housing, or healthcare in the past year. Trump's immigration policies also face widespread disapproval, with 71% believing he is deporting too many people. More than half of Latinos worry about deportation for themselves or loved ones. The poll also found that over two-thirds of Latinos feel the situation for their community has worsened under Trump, a sentiment shared even by a third of those who voted for him. This is the first time in two decades of polling that Latinos have expressed such a negative view of their situation compared to the previous year. Concerns about their place in America have also risen, with 55% expressing serious worries, leading a third to consider leaving the country due to the political climate or cost of living.
