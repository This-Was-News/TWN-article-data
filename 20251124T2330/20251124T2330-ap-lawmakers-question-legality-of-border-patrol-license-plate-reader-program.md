## Article summary
Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns about the legality and privacy implications of a U.S. Border Patrol program that utilizes predictive intelligence to monitor and detain drivers based on their travel patterns. Senator Ed Markey has written to the agency's parent department, labeling the license plate reader program an invasive surveillance network that infringes upon civil liberties and potentially violates the U.S. Constitution. He argues that such widespread surveillance, comparable to that in authoritarian regimes, chills free expression and sets a dangerous precedent for government power. The program, which has operated under multiple administrations, uses cameras to collect license plate data, which is then analyzed by an algorithm to flag suspicious travel. This can lead to individuals being stopped, searched, and sometimes arrested, often with federal agents referring suspicious drivers to local law enforcement for traffic violations. While courts have generally permitted license plate reader collection on public roads, there is a growing legal debate about whether large-scale, persistent tracking of individuals' movements constitutes an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. Other lawmakers, including Representative Dan Goldman and Senator Mark Warner, have echoed these concerns, emphasizing the need for transparency and questioning the constitutionality of detaining individuals based on algorithmic suspicion rather than warrants or concrete evidence. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has previously stated that the program is governed by policy, federal law, and constitutional protections, aimed at identifying threats and disrupting criminal networks.
