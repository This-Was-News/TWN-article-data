## Article summary
President Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping held a phone call on Monday to discuss trade, Taiwan, and Ukraine. This conversation follows a series of diplomatic and trade discussions between the U.S. and China regarding tariffs and technology export restrictions. Trump stated on Truth Social that they covered topics including Ukraine/Russia, Fentanyl, and soybeans, emphasizing a strong relationship and a good deal for American farmers. China's state news agency reported that both leaders agreed to maintain momentum, foster cooperation, and reduce problems in their relationship. The leaders last spoke by phone in September and met in October, after which the U.S. reduced a tariff imposed to curb fentanyl. While a rough trade consensus was reached in October, China's suspension of export controls on rare earth materials is only for one year. Trump mentioned an invitation to visit Beijing and extended an invitation for Xi to visit Washington. The call also addressed China's claims over Taiwan and the conflict in Ukraine, with Xi reiterating that Taiwan's return to China is crucial to the post-war international order.
