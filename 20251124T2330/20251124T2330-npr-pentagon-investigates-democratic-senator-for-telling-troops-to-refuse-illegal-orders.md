## Article summary
The Pentagon has initiated an investigation into Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a retired Navy pilot and former astronaut, for potentially violating military law. This action follows his appearance in a video with other Democratic lawmakers urging active-duty military personnel to refuse "illegal orders." The Pentagon stated it received serious allegations of misconduct against Captain Mark Kelly, USN (Ret.), and is conducting a thorough review. The investigation could potentially lead to his recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures. This development occurs amidst legal questions surrounding the Trump administration's actions, including troop deployments and airstrikes. The video, posted on X, featured Kelly and other Democrats emphasizing the oath to defend the Constitution and the right to refuse illegal orders. President Trump responded on Truth Social, calling the lawmakers' actions "seditious behavior" and a "major crime," though he later clarified he was not threatening death. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that inciting defiance of the chain of command is dangerous and should be held accountable. House Speaker Mike Johnson also expressed strong disapproval of the lawmakers' statements. Senator Kelly stated that the Pentagon's action was the first he heard of the investigation and that it would not intimidate him from holding the administration accountable. Recalling a retired senator to active duty for court-martial is exceedingly rare, with legal experts noting the unique circumstances of Kelly's status as a civilian senator and potential presidential candidate.
