## Article summary
Hospital officials in Gaza reported that Israel handed over 15 more Palestinian bodies, concluding a recent swap as part of a ceasefire agreement. This exchange followed the return of Israeli hostage Dror Or's remains by Palestinian militants. Israel has returned a total of 345 Palestinian bodies since the exchanges began, with two hostages remaining in Gaza. Turkish, Qatari, and Egyptian officials met in Cairo to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire, which includes plans for an international stabilization force and a governing body for Gaza. Identifying the returned Palestinian bodies has been challenging due to a lack of DNA testing kits in Gaza. Dror Or and his wife were killed by militants on October 7, 2023, after ensuring their children's safety. Palestinian militants killed approximately 1,200 people and abducted 251 during their October 7 attack. Hamas expressed its commitment to returning the remaining hostages and urged mediators to pressure Israel regarding ceasefire violations. Separately, Israeli troops reportedly killed a Palestinian man and wounded others in central Gaza. Indonesia is preparing to deploy 20,000 peacekeepers for a potential stabilization force in Gaza, with troops undergoing mission-specific training.
