## Article summary
This Thanksgiving, embrace neuroscience and psychology to navigate holiday disagreements. A Pew Research Center study highlights increasing negative perceptions between Republicans and Democrats, viewing each other as dishonest, immoral, and close-minded. These conversations, often touching on politics, religion, and lifestyle choices, can quickly become personal and unproductive. However, research in neuroscience and psychology offers strategies to bridge these divides. The Short Wave episode explores these scientific insights and features individuals who effectively apply these methods in their daily lives. The goal is to foster better understanding and more constructive dialogue, even amidst differing viewpoints. Listeners interested in more neuroscience and psychology topics are encouraged to share their ideas via email. Support for NPR's Short Wave can be provided by signing up for Short Wave+.
