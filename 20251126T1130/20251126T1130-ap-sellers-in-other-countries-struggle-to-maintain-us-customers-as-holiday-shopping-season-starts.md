## Article summary
Small businesses and consumers are experiencing sticker shock as a tariff exemption for packages under $800 has ended, significantly increasing costs for international shipments to the U.S. This change, implemented on August 29, has led to higher brokerage fees, state taxes, and a 6.5% tariff, almost doubling the cost for some items. Sellers in countries like Canada and Australia report drastic declines in U.S. sales as customers are surprised by the unexpected charges. Some businesses are absorbing the extra costs to maintain customer loyalty, while others, like Kim Doherty's woolen mill, cannot afford to do so and are shifting focus to domestic markets. Chad Lundquist, a U.S. consumer, was surprised by a $10.80 tariff on a $27 purchase of fragrance oil from Canada. Martha Keith, founder of Martha Brook stationery, has seen a 30% drop in U.S. sales and faces a significant financial burden to ship pre-tariff advent calendars. Sue Bacarro of Digi Wildflowers is using banners and social media to inform customers that they will cover U.S. import duties. Selene Pierangelini of Apricot Rain Creations saw her U.S. sales plummet from 85% to 35% after her postal service temporarily halted deliveries to the U.S. The end of the de minimis exemption, intended to curb drug trafficking and low-quality goods, is negatively impacting small businesses and shoppers as the holiday season begins.
