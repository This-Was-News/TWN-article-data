## Article summary
America faces a significant food waste problem, with an estimated 30-40% of all food produced being discarded. This waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, as food decomposing in landfills releases methane, a potent heat-trapping gas. If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter globally. Factors contributing to this issue include consumer habits, holiday overconsumption, and cosmetic standards for produce at the production level. New York City is addressing this problem through its expanded Staten Island Compost Facility, aiming to repurpose food scraps into fertilizer. Composting is presented as a sustainable alternative to landfills, creating a circular economy. However, scaling up composting programs faces challenges, including infrastructure costs, education, and public participation. Despite these hurdles, even modest improvements in food waste management can significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, with food and yard waste comprising a substantial portion of household trash.
