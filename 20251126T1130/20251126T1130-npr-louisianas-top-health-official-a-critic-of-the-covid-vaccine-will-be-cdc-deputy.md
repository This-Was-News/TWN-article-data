## Article summary
Dr. Ralph Abraham, Louisiana's top health official and a critic of COVID vaccines, is set to become the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Abraham has previously expressed skepticism about vaccine safety, calling COVID vaccines "dangerous" and supporting investigations into debunked vaccine-autism links. He has also banned his department from promoting vaccines. This appointment has drawn criticism from public health experts, including former CDC official Dr. Nirav Shah, who called it "atrocious" and a way to "put a scientific gloss" on "anti-vaccine theories." Abraham's tenure in Louisiana included a delayed response to a severe whooping cough outbreak. Public health advocates express concern that Abraham's views may undermine the CDC's credibility and public health efforts, especially given his past support for unproven treatments like ivermectin and opposition to water fluoridation. The CDC's current leadership, lacking medical or scientific backgrounds, may rely on Abraham's medical degree to legitimize their stances. The role of principal deputy director is a high-ranking position, second only to the director, typically held by experienced public health professionals.
