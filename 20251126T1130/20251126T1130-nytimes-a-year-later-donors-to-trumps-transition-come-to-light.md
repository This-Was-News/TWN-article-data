## Article summary
A year after his presidential election, Donald Trump's transition team has finally disclosed a list of 46 donors who contributed to his move into the White House. The transition team raised over $14 million, spending $13.7 million, though individual contribution amounts were not specified. Several donors, including Linda McMahon and Howard Lutnick, later received appointments in the administration. The list's release comes after the transition team declined to sign an agreement with the General Services Administration that would have mandated earlier disclosure and capped donations. This decision allowed for potentially larger contributions than in previous transitions. Watchdog groups expressed concern over the lack of transparency, fearing potential conflicts of interest. The transition team, formally known as Trump Vance 2025 Transition Inc., is a Florida-based nonprofit that does not have to pay taxes but cannot offer donors tax breaks. An annual IRS report detailing finances is expected to be released soon. Some donors also contributed to Trump's inaugural fund and a White House construction project. The lack of detailed information on the list, such as addresses or professions, makes confirming the identities of all donors challenging.
