## Article summary
The FBI is seeking interviews with six Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a social media video urging U.S. troops to defy illegal orders. This action follows a Pentagon review of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona for potential violations of military law. President Donald Trump had accused the lawmakers of sedition following the video's release. Democratic lawmakers involved, including Sen. Elissa Slotkin, have called the FBI's inquiry a scare tactic and a misuse of federal resources. They assert that troops have a duty to refuse unlawful orders, a principle supported by legal precedent. The lawmakers involved have military or intelligence backgrounds. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski criticized the inquiries as reckless and stated that federal law enforcement should prioritize more significant matters. The FBI has not disclosed the specific basis for the requested interviews, and FBI Director Kash Patel stated that decisions on opening inquiries are made by career agents and analysts. The video itself did not cite specific incidents but was prompted by concerns from service members about potentially unlawful actions. The investigations highlight a willingness by the administration to challenge critics, even sitting members of Congress.
