## Article summary
A lawsuit has been filed challenging the practice of arresting individuals who appear for scheduled check-ins with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in San Diego. The legal action, brought forth by the Center for Immigration Law and Policy and the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, targets the detentions of at least three individuals, including Chancely Fanfan, a Haitian national who was arrested after a court hearing and subsequent ICE check-in despite having no criminal history. The lawsuit alleges that these arrests violate due process, as individuals who were previously deemed fit for release are being detained without clear justification. Petitioners argue that they have had no criminal contact since their initial release from federal custody. The detentions appear to have increased since early October, with observations of individuals being taken into custody after their check-ins. The lawsuit seeks class certification, which could allow others arrested under similar circumstances to benefit from a favorable ruling. A federal judge will determine whether to release the petitioners and declare such detentions unlawful. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet responded to requests for comment.
