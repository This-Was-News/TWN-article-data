## Article summary
The National Park Service will implement new entry fee policies for international tourists, effective January 1. These changes include an additional $100 fee for foreign visitors entering popular U.S. parks, with the annual pass price increasing to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to pay $80. This initiative, described as "America-first entry fee policies," aims to address staff reductions, budget cuts, and revenue loss experienced by the parks. The fee hikes will affect 11 national parks, such as the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and Yosemite. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated that these changes ensure U.S. taxpayers maintain affordable access while international visitors contribute to park maintenance and improvements. The announcement follows a July executive order from President Trump directing increased fees for foreign tourists. The National Parks Conservation Association has indicated they will raise implementation questions with the Department of the Interior. In 2018, national parks saw over 14 million international visitors. Revenue generated from these new fees will support park upgrades and maintenance. Additionally, fee-free days will be reserved exclusively for American residents, including Veterans Day, which was previously open to all.
