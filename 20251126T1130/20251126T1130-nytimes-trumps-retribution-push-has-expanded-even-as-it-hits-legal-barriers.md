## Article summary
Donald Trump's retribution efforts are encountering legal hurdles, as seen when a federal judge dismissed indictments against James B. Comey and Letitia James, individuals Trump had pushed the Justice Department to prosecute. Simultaneously, the Pentagon launched an unusual investigation into Senator Mark Kelly for stating that military members could refuse illegal orders. These events highlight that while Trump faces obstacles in using the Justice Department for his retribution campaign, he is also employing a broader, "whole-of-government" strategy to penalize perceived adversaries. This approach extends beyond the criminal justice system, indicating a multifaceted effort to target those he believes have crossed or undermined him. The article suggests that Trump's administration is actively seeking alternative avenues to impose penalties on his opponents, even when direct legal prosecution proves difficult.
