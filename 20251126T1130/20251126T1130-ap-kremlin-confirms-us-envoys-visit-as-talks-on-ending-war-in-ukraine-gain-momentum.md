## Article summary
U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to visit Moscow next week as diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war intensify. Russian officials confirmed the visit but stated they have not yet seen a U.S. peace proposal, despite recent talks in Abu Dhabi. U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll's potential visit to Kyiv was also mentioned. A peace plan, initially appearing to favor Russian demands, was discussed by U.S. and Ukrainian officials, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy finding it potentially workable but with unresolved issues. Reports surfaced that Witkoff coached a Putin aide on presenting the peace plan to former President Trump, a move Trump described as standard dealmaking. Meanwhile, the conflict continues, with Russia launching a drone attack on Zaporizhzhia, damaging residential buildings and injuring civilians, while Russia reported downing Ukrainian drones. European nations are concerned about their role in the negotiations, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasizing the need for European and Ukrainian approval for a sustainable peace. European Union executive head Ursula Von der Leyen expressed optimism for progress but stressed that any settlement must include security guarantees for Ukraine and not limit its armed forces or NATO aspirations.
