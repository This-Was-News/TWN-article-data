## Article summary
President Trump's administration has conducted a surprising military action in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who are now facing trial in New York. This move marks a significant shift for Trump, who campaigned against American intervention, yet has now authorized strikes in multiple countries during his second term. The justifications for removing Maduro have varied, including combating drug trafficking and leveraging oil resources, with Trump emphasizing the potential for U.S. oil companies to modernize Venezuela's infrastructure. This action appears to highlight the increased influence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been a vocal critic of left-wing dictatorships in Latin America. The administration's rationale, focusing on drug trafficking, is seen as politically palatable to the MAGA base, contrasting with Trump's previous praise for some right-wing authoritarians. Despite potential criticism regarding the legality and the irony of his actions, Trump is unlikely to face significant backlash from his base, as conservative media is expected to rally support. Democrats face a messaging challenge, needing to balance criticism of the action's legality with the risk of appearing to defend drug traffickers, while also potentially using it to highlight Republican priorities over domestic issues. The long-term political success of this intervention hinges on what happens next in Venezuela, as the administration has yet to lay out a clear plan for the country's future, a point that could be politically vulnerable for Trump.
