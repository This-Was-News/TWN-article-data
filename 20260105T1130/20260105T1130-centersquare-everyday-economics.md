## Article summary
This week's labor data, including the JOLTS report and the December jobs report, is crucial for understanding the trajectory of the U.S. labor market. Recent trends indicate a softening, with rising unemployment and declining employment numbers, suggesting a shift from peak tightness to weaker demand and increased layoffs. Consensus forecasts for the December jobs report predict slim payroll growth and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.7%, the highest since September 2021. The deterioration is not uniform, with healthcare and social assistance being the primary drivers of job gains, while other sectors like transportation and manufacturing are shedding jobs. Wage growth has also cooled to 3.5% year-over-year, a level not seen in four years, which is beneficial for inflation but strains household budgets. The Federal Reserve's recent 25 basis point rate cut reflects concerns about slowing job gains and increased downside risks to employment. Future data will determine the Fed's next steps, with continued weakness supporting further easing. For businesses, the era of labor shortages is over, necessitating a focus on flexibility, productivity, and cost control. The upcoming data will confirm whether the labor market's visible cracks are becoming undeniable, setting the tone for markets, policy, and growth expectations in 2026.
