## Article summary
President Donald Trump has reversed his earlier stance on the alleged Ukrainian strike on Russian President Vladimir Putin's residence. Initially, Trump had expressed concern and believed Putin's claim, stating, "It's no good." However, after further assessment, Trump now states he does not believe the attack occurred. He clarified that while something happened nearby, it was unrelated to the alleged strike on Putin's residence. Trump attributed his initial belief to a lack of information at the time, explaining that Putin had informed him of the incident directly. This contradicts his previous statements made on December 29th. The Kremlin had claimed Ukraine used 91 drones in the operation, which they stated was thwarted by Russian defenses. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had condemned the action and threatened retaliation. Conversely, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently denied the attack, calling it a "complete fabrication" and "typical Russian lies" intended to justify further attacks and derail peace negotiations. Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine does not take actions that undermine diplomacy, unlike Russia, and urged the international community not to remain silent.
