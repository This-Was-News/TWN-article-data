## Article summary
The U.S. operation to depose and capture Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela has drawn two main reactions. The first marvels at the skill and daring of American forces, contrasting it with past operations. The second reaction centers on President Trump's statement that the U.S. will 'run' Venezuela until a safe transition can occur. This has raised questions about the meaning of 'run,' with Trump indicating U.S. officials will be designated to coordinate the country's affairs. While Trump suggested U.S. troops might be necessary, Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified that the U.S. will not appoint officials or rewrite laws. Instead, the U.S. aims to guide Venezuelan officials away from corruption, drug trafficking, and mass migration, and towards better relations with the U.S. Rubio emphasized that U.S. leverage comes from its ability to block Venezuela's oil transactions, ensuring the nation's oil industry isn't controlled by U.S. adversaries. The success of this plan hinges on how quickly the U.S. can achieve a stable transition, as prolonged involvement could lead to accusations of nation-building, a strategy Trump has opposed. A swift and successful transition would be a significant achievement for Trump, while failure could lead to considerable political trouble.
