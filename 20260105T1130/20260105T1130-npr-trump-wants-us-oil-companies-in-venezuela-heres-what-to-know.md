## Article summary
President Trump has expressed a desire for U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela, following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Despite Venezuela possessing the world's largest proven oil reserves, its current production is a fraction of its past output, producing only about a million barrels a day. Historically, U.S. companies like Chevron played a significant role in Venezuela's oil sector, but disputes over contract renegotiations led to major companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips leaving and seeking billions in arbitration. Chevron remains, producing about a quarter of Venezuela's oil. The global oil market currently faces an oversupply, and Venezuela's heavy crude is considered "among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce" due to its environmental impact. Neighboring Guyana, however, has become a rising oil star with lighter, less polluting crude and more attractive tax conditions, attracting companies like ExxonMobil. Experts suggest that revitalizing Venezuela's oil industry faces significant hurdles, including the need for substantial financial support, improved management, and crucially, political stability to ensure the long-term viability of any contracts and investments.
