## Article summary
President Trump has signaled a renewed assertiveness in U.S. foreign policy, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, following the swift capture of Venezuela's leader. He has invoked a "Donroe Doctrine," an update to the Monroe Doctrine, asserting U.S. dominance and the right to claim strategically vital assets. Trump has threatened Colombia with similar action, citing its president's alleged involvement in drug trafficking, and has reiterated his desire for the U.S. to control Greenland for national security reasons. This approach prioritizes transactional gains, such as access to Venezuela's oil reserves, over the promotion of democracy, a departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy objectives. The strategy, outlined in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy, aims to counter non-hemispheric competitors like China and Russia. While Trump's rhetoric is often blunt, his administration's actions suggest a willingness to use U.S. power to secure resources and influence. The historical context of the Monroe Doctrine, established to prevent European colonization, contrasts with Trump's modern interpretation focused on U.S. resource acquisition. Despite potential economic and diplomatic challenges, Trump appears determined to pursue these objectives, viewing them as long-term investments for the United States.
