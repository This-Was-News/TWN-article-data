## Article summary
The recent U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has significantly divided the Latin American region, aligning with President Donald Trump's assertive foreign policy. Trump proclaimed American dominance in the Western Hemisphere, signaling a new era of U.S. interventionism marked by tariffs, sanctions, and military actions aimed at combating drug trafficking, halting immigration, securing resources, and countering Russian and Chinese influence. This aggressive approach, dubbed the 'Donroe Doctrine,' has created a clear divide between Trump-friendly leaders and those who express grave concerns. Right-wing leaders like Argentina's Javier Milei and Ecuador's Daniel Noboa celebrated Maduro's ouster, viewing it as a victory for democracy and a blow against 'narco-terrorist' regimes. Conversely, left-wing presidents such as Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the action as a dangerous precedent and an act of aggression against sovereignty. The U.S. raid evokes historical memories of U.S. intervention in Latin America, from supporting dictatorships to promoting corporate interests, leading to both harsh condemnations and uneasy responses even from some allies. Trump has also put perceived enemies like Cuba and Mexico on notice, emphasizing his desire for compliant nations in the hemisphere. The situation highlights a broader trend of rising right-wing, Trump-like leaders across Latin America who prioritize security and oppose globalization.
