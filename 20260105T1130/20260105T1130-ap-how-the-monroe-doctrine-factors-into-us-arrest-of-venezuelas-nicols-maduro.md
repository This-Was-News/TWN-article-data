## Article summary
President Donald Trump invoked the Monroe Doctrine, a foreign policy principle established by President James Monroe in 1823, to justify the U.S. military action leading to the arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. The Monroe Doctrine was originally intended to prevent European interference in the Western Hemisphere, with the U.S. also agreeing to stay out of European affairs. Over time, the doctrine has been used by various U.S. presidents to justify interventions in Latin America. For example, Theodore Roosevelt's Corollary in 1904 allowed for U.S. intervention in unstable Latin American countries. During the Cold War, it was used against communism, such as the demand for Soviet missile withdrawal from Cuba. Trump's administration has also referenced a "Trump Corollary" in its national security strategy, aiming to reassert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere and combat threats like drug trafficking and migration. This move, however, could potentially create divisions within Trump's political base, particularly among isolationists concerned about prolonged U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts.
