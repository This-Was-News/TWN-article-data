## Article summary
The article "Costly refugee funding on the table as they rake in over a dozen taxpayer benefits" by Sarah Roderick-Fitch highlights the significant increase in federal funding for refugee assistance programs under the Biden administration. Funding for Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs rose from less than $2 billion in fiscal year 2021 to nearly $9 billion in fiscal year 2022. This surge is attributed to the admission of hundreds of thousands of refugees, particularly from Afghanistan and Somalia. The article details over a dozen taxpayer-funded benefits that refugees are eligible to receive, including housing assistance, food stamps, healthcare, and educational grants. Despite this extensive support, the article notes that certain refugee groups, such as Afghans and Somalis, exhibit higher rates of poverty and lower labor force participation compared to other immigrant populations and U.S.-born individuals. For instance, a report indicates that about 80% of Somalians resettled in Minnesota rely on some form of taxpayer-funded welfare. As Congress prepares to vote on appropriations for fiscal year 2026, approximately $5.69 billion is allocated for refugee assistance services, continuing the debate over the cost and efficacy of these programs.
