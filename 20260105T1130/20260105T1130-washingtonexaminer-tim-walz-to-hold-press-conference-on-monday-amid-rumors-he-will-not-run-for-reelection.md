## Article summary
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is scheduled to hold a press conference on Monday to address his political future, amidst widespread rumors that he will not seek reelection in 2026. These speculations intensified after Walz reportedly met with Senator Amy Klobuchar on Sunday to discuss his plans. Sources suggest Walz may announce his withdrawal from the gubernatorial race, potentially opening the door for Klobuchar to enter the contest, though no official confirmations have been made. This potential withdrawal follows a period of significant scrutiny for Walz, particularly concerning allegations and revelations of extensive fraud within Minnesota's social services programs, including billions of dollars in suspected Medicaid fraud and issues with daycare centers. Walz had previously announced his reelection bid in September, stating his intention to continue his work and build on the state's progress. The ongoing investigations into the alleged fraudulent activities, including those by the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families, have drawn criticism. Republican gubernatorial candidate Kendall Qualls has called for Walz's resignation, citing the lack of high-level official accountability for the alleged fraud. Walz's press conference is set for 11 a.m. local time on Monday.
