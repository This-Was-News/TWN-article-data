## Article summary
Nicolás Maduro's presidency in Venezuela, which began in 2013 after being hand-picked by Hugo Chávez, has been marked by a severe economic collapse and political turmoil. Maduro inherited an economy heavily reliant on oil, which faltered after his rise to power, leading to hyperinflation and a drastic shrinkage of the country's GDP. This economic devastation triggered a massive migration, with millions of Venezuelans fleeing the country. Despite opportunities to course-correct, Maduro's leadership has been criticized for negligence and a lack of empathy. In 2024, the presidential election was deemed illegitimate by independent observers due to restrictions on opposition candidates, though Maduro declared himself the winner. The U.S. Department of Justice has accused Maduro of operating a vast drug-trafficking network and is scheduled to bring him to trial in New York. Maduro has denied these accusations, asserting that the U.S. aims to seize Venezuela's natural resources. His rise was shaped by his early involvement in youth politics and mentorship under Chávez, eventually leading him to become a prominent spokesperson and loyal successor. The economic policies under his government, including heavy reliance on the state oil company and excessive money printing, are seen as key factors in the nation's downfall.
