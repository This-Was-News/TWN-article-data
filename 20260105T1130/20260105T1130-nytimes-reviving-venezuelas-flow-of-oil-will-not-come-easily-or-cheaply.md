## Article summary
President Trump envisions U.S. oil companies rapidly reviving Venezuela's oil industry after Nicolás Maduro's ouster, but this ambitious goal faces significant hurdles. While a few Western producers could increase output relatively quickly under the right political conditions, a substantial revitalization would require years and tens of billions of dollars. Despite Venezuela possessing the world's largest oil reserves, the risks are high, and companies like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips have had negative experiences there previously. Current low oil prices further complicate investment decisions. Key uncertainties include the post-Maduro Venezuelan government and the continuation of U.S. sanctions. Ali Moshiri suggests that Chevron and other smaller operators could potentially raise Venezuela's oil output to 1.5 million barrels a day within 18 months, costing up to $7 billion. However, this would still represent a fraction of global oil usage and significantly less than Venezuela's 1990s production levels. Further expansion is hindered by severely dilapidated infrastructure, requiring time for contract negotiations and re-establishing a presence. Daniel Yergin emphasizes the critical role of politics and leadership stability. U.S. sanctions, designed to weaken the Venezuelan government, remain in place and will continue until policy changes occur. Chevron, holding a unique license, is currently the only company regularly exporting oil and is thus best positioned to increase production if conditions stabilize. Other companies like Eni and Repsol produce natural gas but cannot export it due to sanctions. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, having left Venezuela years ago after nationalization, are still seeking billions in compensation for seized assets. For significant foreign investment to resume, lifting U.S. sanctions is considered essential by experts like Moshiri.
