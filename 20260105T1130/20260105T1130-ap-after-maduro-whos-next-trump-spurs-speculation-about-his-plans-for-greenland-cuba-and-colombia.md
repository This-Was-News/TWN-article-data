## Article summary
Following a U.S. military operation that led to the ouster of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump has intensified speculation about his future foreign policy actions. Trump has renewed his interest in acquiring Greenland for U.S. security and issued threats towards Colombia over its role in the global cocaine trade. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also delivered a stern warning to Cuba, suggesting its government is in significant trouble. These statements indicate a more expansive U.S. role in the Western Hemisphere, drawing parallels to the Monroe Doctrine. Denmark has expressed strong opposition to any U.S. attempts to annex Greenland, emphasizing their close alliance and Greenland's territorial integrity. A social media post from a former Trump administration official further fueled tensions with Denmark. In Cuba, the ouster of Maduro, a key ally and oil provider, is expected to further destabilize its already struggling economy. Trump's comments about Colombia, a major cocaine producer, suggest potential U.S. intervention. The administration's assertive approach is causing unease among both allies and adversaries in the region and beyond.
