## Article summary
Groups across the U.S. organized protests following the Trump administration's capture and removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The feminist anti-war organization CODEPINK condemned the action as illegal and an act of war, stating the U.S. bombed civilian and military sites and kidnapped Maduro. President Trump described the event as a large-scale U.S. strike focused on seizing Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, after months of escalating conflict. Protests occurred in major cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Portland, and Washington, D.C., with attendees carrying signs such as "No blood for oil" and "Stop bombing Venezuela now." The administration claims Maduro is responsible for illegal immigration and drug trafficking into the U.S. and gained power illegitimately. Protesters, however, believe the U.S. acted illegally to serve its own interests and exploit Venezuela's natural resources. The Answer Coalition also listed over 100 protest locations nationwide. The Trump administration stated that Maduro and his wife face criminal charges in New York, with the Attorney General vowing they would "face the full wrath of American justice."
