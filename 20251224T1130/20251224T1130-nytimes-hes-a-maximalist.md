## Article summary
Donald Trump's Oval Office has undergone significant renovations, reflecting his personal taste for opulent, gilded decor reminiscent of Louis XIV's style. Many items, including gold angel statuettes, were brought from his Mar-a-Lago estate, while others are sourced from the White House archives. The president personally approves selections, sometimes visiting vaults to choose items. A notable addition is a portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy, whom Trump admires. The extensive use of gold, applied with real gold leaf over plaster or metal, is seen as a visual metaphor for his success and a deliberate creation of a "gilded stage" for his presidency. Beyond decor, Trump has made functional changes, such as installing a red button to order Diet Coke and replacing lighting for better televised appearances. Unlike previous presidents who used the office more formally, Trump treats it as a dynamic boardroom or center stage, often with numerous aides and allies present, leading to extended and sometimes unstructured meetings. The overall effect is a highly personalized and brightly lit space, with ongoing smaller additions and a potential for chandeliers.
