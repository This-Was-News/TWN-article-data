## Article summary
Venezuela's National Assembly has approved a law criminalizing actions that threaten maritime navigation and trade, including the seizure of oil tankers. This move comes in response to recent seizures of Venezuelan oil tankers by U.S. forces in international waters. The bill, which awaits President Nicolás Maduro's signature, proposes fines and prison sentences of up to 20 years for involvement in piracy, blockades, or other illegal acts against entities doing business with Venezuela. The U.S. has been intensifying pressure on Maduro's administration, viewing the tankers as a means to evade economic sanctions. U.S. Ambassador Mike Waltz stated that these tankers are the primary economic lifeline for Maduro's regime, funding his "narco-terrorist activities." Venezuela's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada accused the U.S. of acting outside international law and questioned its right to seize Venezuelan oil. While many countries expressed concern over violations of international maritime law, a few, including Panama and Argentina, supported the U.S. actions. The opposition in Venezuela, led by María Corina Machado, has aligned with President Trump's policy towards Maduro.
