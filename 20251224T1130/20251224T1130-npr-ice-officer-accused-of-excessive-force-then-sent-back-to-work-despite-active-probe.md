## Article summary
An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, Victor Mojica, was placed on administrative leave after being caught on video roughly pushing a woman. The incident occurred at an immigration court in New York and rapidly circulated online, prompting a public statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) criticizing the officer's behavior. However, Mojica was reinstated to his job within three days, before the DHS Office of Inspector General had concluded its review. The Inspector General's office ultimately decided not to pursue a criminal probe nearly two months later. This rapid reinstatement and lack of transparency have raised concerns about DHS oversight mechanisms and disciplinary practices. Critics and former ICE personnel worry this points to a larger systemic issue of politicization within law enforcement and erodes public trust. DHS has not provided detailed explanations regarding its investigation process or the reasons for Mojica's swift return to duty. While DHS stated that allegations of excessive force are reviewed through internal mechanisms, they declined to litigate personnel matters publicly. Concerns about DHS discipline predate the Trump administration, with a past review finding ICE did not consistently follow its own policies. Experts suggest that rapid hiring and pressure to increase deportations could exacerbate existing problems. The lack of clear communication and swift reinstatement of an officer publicly denounced by the agency has led some to believe ICE is losing its professionalism.
