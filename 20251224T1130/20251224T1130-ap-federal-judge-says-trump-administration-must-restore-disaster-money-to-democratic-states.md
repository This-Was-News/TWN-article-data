## Article summary
A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to cut Homeland Security funding to several Democratic states. These states were penalized for not cooperating with federal immigration enforcement, leading to a reduction of over $233 million in grants. U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy ruled that the administration's actions were arbitrary and capricious, ordering the Department of Homeland Security to restore the funding. The judge emphasized that withholding funds for vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs based on political whims is unlawful. This ruling comes after a separate legal challenge where a judge deemed it unconstitutional to condition FEMA disaster funding on state cooperation with immigration enforcement. While the administration plans to fight the order, attorneys general who sued applauded the decision, stating it prevents the administration from punishing states for not adhering to its immigration agenda. The funding is crucial for preparing and responding to disasters and emergencies, as highlighted by a recent tragedy at Brown University.
