## Article summary
Crime rates in the U.S. experienced a significant decline in 2025, with drops observed in both violent and property crimes across diverse regions, including big cities and small towns, and in both red and blue states. The number of murders saw a substantial decrease of about 20% compared to the previous year, according to the Real Time Crime Index. Experts attribute this positive trend partly to the nation moving past the peak stresses of the pandemic, which had previously led to a surge in homicides during 2020 and 2021. The reduction in crime is also viewed as a potential "virtuous cycle," where fewer crimes allow law enforcement more resources to investigate each incident. However, there's a noted disconnect between this widespread crime decrease and political rhetoric, with some leaders, like President Trump, portraying crime as escalating, particularly in certain cities. Researchers caution against using crime fears to justify crackdowns, citing historical precedents of such justifications leading to the repression of civil rights. Looking ahead to 2026, experts express concern that the decline may not continue, citing potential impacts from government funding cuts to community safety programs. These cuts could hinder efforts in violence prevention and community support, potentially reversing the progress made in 2025.
