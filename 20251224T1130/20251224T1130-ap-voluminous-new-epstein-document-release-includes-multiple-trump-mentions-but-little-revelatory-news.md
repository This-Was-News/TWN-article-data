## Article summary
The U.S. Justice Department has released a substantial batch of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, including numerous mentions of Donald Trump. While the release is the most voluminous to date, it offers little new revelatory information. Many references to Trump appear in news clippings, though an email from a prosecutor highlights Trump's flights on Epstein's private jet in the 1990s, a period relevant to Ghislaine Maxwell's case. Trump, who was friends with Epstein before a falling out, has not been accused of wrongdoing. The Justice Department has stated that some released documents contain false claims about Trump made before the 2020 election and has identified a purported letter from Epstein to Larry Nassar as fake. The latest release also includes a subpoena served to Mar-a-Lago for employment records. Trump has characterized the document releases as a distraction from Republican achievements. Other high-profile individuals, including Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson, are also mentioned in the files, though their inclusion does not imply wrongdoing. Correspondence suggests Prince Andrew may have been in contact with Ghislaine Maxwell. The document release, mandated by law, is being conducted in stages to protect victims, though some survivors advocate for greater transparency. Critics argue that too much information is still being withheld.
