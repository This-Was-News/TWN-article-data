## Article summary
The White House, under President Trump, has enthusiastically embraced Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), viewing it as a key driver of economic growth and dismissing concerns about potential risks. This optimism contrasts with the more cautious stance of many economists and technologists who worry about job displacement and unsustainable growth methods. Despite market jitters and warnings from experts about a potential A.I. bubble, the administration has focused on deregulating the industry and celebrating the soaring stock prices of A.I.-related tech companies. While some acknowledge A.I. as a productivity game-changer, former officials and Federal Reserve governors express concern about its impact on the labor market and the potential for financial instability, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble. The administration's policy, including restricting state-level regulations, aims to foster A.I. growth, with officials stating there will be no federal bailout for A.I. companies, though some analysts warn of systemic risks if major players falter. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring A.I.'s effects on inflation and employment, recognizing both potential benefits and drawbacks.
