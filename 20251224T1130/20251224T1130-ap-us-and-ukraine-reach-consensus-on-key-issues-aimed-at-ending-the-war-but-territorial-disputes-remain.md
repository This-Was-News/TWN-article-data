## Article summary
The United States and Ukraine have reached an agreement on key issues to end the ongoing conflict, though territorial disputes and the management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain points of contention. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy briefed journalists on a draft proposal that aims to balance security with economic potential. Russia has stated it will formulate its position based on information from its envoy who met with U.S. officials. The most significant hurdle is the territorial dispute over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with the U.S. proposing free economic zones and Ukraine insisting on a referendum and demilitarization. Another complex issue is the management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with the U.S. suggesting a tripartite consortium and Ukraine proposing a joint venture with the U.S. The agreement includes strong security guarantees for Ukraine, mirroring NATO's Article 5, to be detailed in a separate bilateral document with the U.S. It also proposes maintaining Ukraine's army at 800,000 during peacetime and sets a date for EU ascension. The plan includes accelerating a free trade agreement with the U.S., with Ukraine seeking privileged access to the European market and a global development package for reconstruction and investment in various industries. The proposal also requires Ukraine to hold elections post-agreement and calls for the release of all prisoners since 2014.
