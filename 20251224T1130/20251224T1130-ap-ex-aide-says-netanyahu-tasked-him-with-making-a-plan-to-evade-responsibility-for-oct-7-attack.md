## Article summary
A former close aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims that immediately after the October 2023 Hamas attack, Netanyahu instructed him to devise a strategy for the prime minister to avoid accountability for the security lapse. Eli Feldstein, a former Netanyahu spokesperson currently facing trial for alleged leaks of classified information, made these accusations in an interview with Israels Kan news channel. Feldstein stated that Netanyahu appeared panicked when he made the request and asked him to find a way to offset the media attention on the issue of responsibility. He was later instructed by individuals in Netanyahu's inner circle to exclude the word "responsibility" from all official statements. Hamas-led militants killed approximately 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages on October 7, 2023, leading to a war in Gaza that has resulted in nearly 71,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Netanyahu's office has refuted Feldstein's claims, calling them "mendacious and recycled allegations" from someone with personal motives. Feldstein's statements follow his indictment for allegedly leaking classified military information and his status as a suspect in the Qatargate scandal.
