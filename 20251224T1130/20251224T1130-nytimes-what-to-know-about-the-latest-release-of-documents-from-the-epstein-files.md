## Article summary
The Department of Justice has released a new batch of files concerning Jeffrey Epstein, containing nearly 30,000 documents. These files include various versions of Epstein's will, redacted tax returns for Ghislaine Maxwell, and internal communications from the jail where Epstein died. The documents also reference President Trump multiple times, including details about his past travel on Epstein's private jet and two subpoenas sent to Mar-a-Lago. However, the Justice Department stated that some accusations in the newly released material are false. Prince Andrew is also referenced in correspondence with Maxwell, where he appears to inquire about "inappropriate friends" and "girls" before a trip to Peru. The files also reveal that Wall Street executives, including former heads of Bear Stearns and JP Morgan Chase, were named as executors of Epstein's estate at different times. Additionally, federal agents attempted to contact around 10 potential co-conspirators shortly after Epstein's arrest in 2019, with names like Leslie Wexner and Jean-Luc Brunel appearing unredacted. In contrast to previous releases, Trump administration officials deflected attention from President Trump's appearance in these documents, labeling claims against him as "unfounded and false."
