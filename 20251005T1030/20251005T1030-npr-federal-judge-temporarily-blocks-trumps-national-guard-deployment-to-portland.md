## Article summary
A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, temporarily blocked President Trump from federalizing 200 members of the state's National Guard. Judge Karin J. Immergut ruled that the government did not meet the threshold for declaring recent protests outside an ICE facility a rebellion. She noted that the Portland Police Bureau and other local law enforcement were capable of managing the protests, which were generally small and nonviolent. The Trump administration argued that the deployment was necessary to protect federal personnel at the ICE facility, citing sporadic violence and property damage. State and local officials rejected the need for National Guard involvement, stating that the protests were small and mostly peaceful. The judge's decision comes as the Trump administration deploys the National Guard to several American cities, despite objections from local leaders. The broader lawsuit filed by the city and state to declare the deployment unlawful will proceed separately. The protests in Portland have been much smaller than those in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. The Trump administration has faced legal challenges over similar deployments in other cities, with courts previously ruling against the use of the National Guard for civilian law enforcement.
