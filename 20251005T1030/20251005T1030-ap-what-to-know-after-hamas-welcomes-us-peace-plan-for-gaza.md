## Article summary
Both Israel and Hamas have signaled support for a new U.S. plan to end the war in Gaza and release all remaining hostages. President Trump has urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza but warns Hamas to act quickly. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu hopes to announce the release of all hostages soon. The plan includes immediate cessation of hostilities, release of hostages and prisoners, withdrawal of Israeli troops, and international governance of Gaza. Hamas has expressed willingness to release hostages and hand over power but has not agreed to disarm. Netanyahu insists on Hamas's surrender and disarmament. Key uncertainties remain, including the timing of steps and the future of Gaza. Arab mediators are preparing for talks to unify Palestinian positions. There is cautious hope among Palestinians and hostage families, but memories of past failed negotiations persist.
