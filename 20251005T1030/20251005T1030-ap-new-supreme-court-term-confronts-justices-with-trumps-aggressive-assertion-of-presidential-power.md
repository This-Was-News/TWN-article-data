## Article summary
The Supreme Court's new term begins with significant cases on presidential power, voting rights, and LGBTQ rights. The conservative majority has generally supported President Trump's assertions of authority, with liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson criticizing the approach as 'Calvinball jurisprudence.' Key cases include the legality of Trump's tariffs, his power to fire independent agency members, and an executive order denying birthright citizenship. The court will also consider a case on congressional redistricting in Louisiana, which could impact the Voting Rights Act. Additionally, the justices will review limits on political party spending and cases involving transgender athletes. The court's decisions could have far-reaching implications, with potential changes to long-standing legal precedents. The term is expected to be highly polarizing, with a clear conservative-liberal divide. The justices will also consider the future of electoral districts with majorities of Black, Hispanic, or Native American voters. The court's rulings will shape the landscape of presidential power, voting rights, and civil rights for years to come.
