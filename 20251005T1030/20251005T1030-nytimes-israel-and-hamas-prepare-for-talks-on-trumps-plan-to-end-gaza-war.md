## Article summary
Israel and Hamas are preparing for indirect negotiations in Egypt to discuss a plan proposed by President Trump to end the Gaza war. The talks, scheduled for Monday, aim to secure the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Key points of contention include the terms of the hostage exchange, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the disarmament of Hamas. The plan involves releasing 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of at least 25 others in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans jailed during the war. Hamas has expressed reservations about several aspects of the plan, particularly the disarmament and the extent of Israeli withdrawal. The negotiations face significant challenges, including the logistical difficulties of locating and recovering hostages and bodies. The war, which began with a Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 65,000 deaths in Gaza, including thousands of children. The success of the talks hinges on overcoming these obstacles and reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.
