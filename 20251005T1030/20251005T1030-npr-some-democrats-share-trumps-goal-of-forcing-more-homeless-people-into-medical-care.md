## Article summary
President Trump has proposed forcing homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for medical care, a plan that has raised concerns among experts. Portland, Oregon, while not a 'war zone,' still struggles with visible homelessness and drug use, leading to public frustration. Trump's plan involves expanding civil commitment laws to mandate medical care for those with severe addiction and mental illness. Some Democrats, including officials in California, New York, Oregon, and Massachusetts, support similar measures. Oregon's new law, crafted by Democratic state Rep. Jason Kropf, aims to balance helping those in crisis with avoiding over-institutionalization. Judy Thompson, an advocate for mental illness services, supports expanded civil commitment after her son's struggles with bipolar schizoaffective disorder. Experts warn against using forced care as a solution to restore public order, emphasizing the need for less invasive programs like affordable healthcare and housing subsidies. Trump's executive order diverts funds from 'woke' liberal programs to pay for these initiatives, but critics argue more resources are needed. The effectiveness and ethical implications of these measures will depend on how they are implemented.
