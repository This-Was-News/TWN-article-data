## Article summary
A federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Portland, ruling that the small protests did not justify federal intervention. Judge Karin Immergut emphasized the importance of resisting government overreach and upholding constitutional law. The Trump administration appealed the decision. Oregon officials had sued to stop the deployment, arguing that the protests were not violent or disruptive enough to warrant federal troops. The judge agreed, stating that the president's determination was not based on facts. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the president's actions, while Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield criticized the deployment as unnecessary. Trump has previously deployed or threatened to deploy troops in other U.S. cities led by Democrats. The Portland protests have been limited to a small area and have generally been peaceful, with only minor incidents of vandalism or criminal activity. The judge's ruling reaffirmed the importance of state sovereignty and the need for federal actions to be justified by facts.
