## Article summary
President Donald Trump's administration has demanded that Governor JB Pritzker call up 300 Illinois National Guard troops, threatening to federalize them if he refuses. Pritzker criticized the demand as outrageous and un-American. The request follows a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to deploy 100 military troops to Illinois for the protection of ICE personnel. Trump has cited Chicago's crime rate, despite a decline in violent crime and murder rates, as a reason for sending troops. A recent shooting by U.S. Border Patrol agents in Chicago has heightened tensions. Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton argued that deploying federal troops would escalate conflict and undermine community trust. ICE agents have conducted raids in Chicago, detaining residents and facing protests that have turned violent. Pritzker dismissed the troop deployment as a manufactured performance aimed at control rather than public safety. The White House has not responded to requests for comment.
