## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown has entered its fifth week with both Democrats and Republicans remaining entrenched in their positions. Senate Republicans had hoped a union appeal would sway Democrats, while Democrats anticipated news of rising Obamacare premiums would pressure Republicans, but neither development broke the stalemate. Several significant milestones are approaching, including the start of Obamacare open enrollment, a potential suspension of federal nutrition benefits for millions, and off-year elections, which both parties are watching for potential shifts in political momentum. Lawmakers are nearing the record for the longest government shutdown. Republicans are considering the impact of halted nutrition benefits on millions of Americans, while Democrats plan to push for votes to extend these programs, aiming to put Republicans in a difficult position. Democrats are also counting on the upcoming Obamacare open enrollment to highlight premium increases and pressure Republican voters. The return of President Trump to Washington is also a factor, with Democrats skeptical of progress during his absence. Some Democrats privately acknowledge internal divisions on how to proceed. As Thanksgiving approaches, the continued impact on federal workers, including air traffic controllers, is expected to increase pressure for a resolution.
