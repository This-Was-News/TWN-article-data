## Article summary
Nvidia has become the first company to surpass $5 trillion in market value, driven by the artificial intelligence boom ignited by ChatGPT. The company's AI chips are crucial components for AI development, making Nvidia a linchpin in the global economy and a strategic asset in international trade negotiations. Nvidia's market value surge has significantly contributed to U.S. GDP growth, highlighting the increasing dependence of the stock market on a few dominant tech companies. Despite the optimism surrounding AI, questions remain about its ultimate productivity and the justification for the massive investments being made. Nvidia's chips are highly sought after by businesses and governments, influencing U.S. foreign policy and trade strategies, particularly with China. The company is also shifting some manufacturing to the U.S., with its latest AI chip, Blackwell, being produced in Arizona. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, believes AI will become as essential as electricity and the internet, with every company and nation eventually utilizing it. While Nvidia has secured substantial orders for its chips, concerns persist among investors about the long-term viability and return on investment for AI technologies. The company's dominance in the AI chip market mirrors historical tech giants like Intel and Microsoft in their respective eras, positioning Nvidia at the forefront of the current computing wave.
