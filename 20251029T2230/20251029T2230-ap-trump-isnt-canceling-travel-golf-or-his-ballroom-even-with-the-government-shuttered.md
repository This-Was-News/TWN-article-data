## Article summary
President Donald Trump is continuing his regular schedule of travel, golf, and White House events despite the ongoing government shutdown, a departure from the practices of past presidents during similar crises. While approximately 750,000 federal employees are furloughed and services like SNAP face funding lapses, Trump has embarked on international trips, hosted fundraisers, and maintained a significant portion of his White House staff. This approach contrasts with his first term, when he curtailed his schedule and canceled holiday travel during a shutdown. Unlike previous shutdowns where presidents often scaled back their activities to appear sympathetic, Trump's administration has a lower percentage of staff furloughed, making it difficult to discern the shutdown's impact. This strategy may offer political advantages, allowing him to appear presidential while avoiding congressional disputes. Some observers suggest this approach is a deliberate political tactic, aiming to avoid taking ownership of the shutdown and instead blame Democrats. While past presidents have used shutdowns to negotiate, Trump's focus appears to be elsewhere, with his administration signaling a willingness to wait out the closure. Americans are divided on who is to blame for the shutdown, with a recent poll showing roughly equal responsibility attributed to both Trump/Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The situation remains a muddle, with no clear winners or losers likely to emerge.
