## Article summary
More than four months after fashion designer Arthur Folasa Ah Loo was fatally shot during a June No Kings protest in Salt Lake City, his widow, Laura Ah Loo, is demanding accountability. Ah Loo, known as Afa, died when a volunteer peacekeeper fired at a man who allegedly brandished a rifle. The rifleman, Arturo Gamboa, was arrested but not charged, with police stating he created the dangerous situation. Gamboa's lawyer claims he was lawfully carrying an unloaded weapon. The safety volunteer who shot Ah Loo has not been publicly identified or charged, though authorities are investigating the justification for his actions. The 50501 Movement, which organized the protests, stated weapons were prohibited. Ah Loo's family and their lawyers are calling for charges against the volunteer and plan to file a wrongful death lawsuit. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill stated a decision on charges is expected soon, acknowledging the case's complexity. However, legal experts suggest criminal charges are unlikely due to Utah's strong self-defense and gun carry laws, with a civil lawsuit being a more feasible path to justice and compensation for the family.
