## Article summary
The White House has terminated six members of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency responsible for advising on the design of federal buildings, monuments, and coins. This commission, established in 1910, has reviewed plans for significant projects such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The terminated commissioners include Bruce Redman Becker, Peter D. Cook, Lisa E. Delplace, William J. Lenihan, Justin Garrett Moore, and vice chair Hazel Ruth Edwards. The White House stated that the new appointments will be "more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies." These commissioners would have advised on projects like President Trump's planned White House ballroom and a monument commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. However, one of the fired commissioners noted that neither of these projects had yet been submitted for review. President Trump has not yet announced the replacements. Notably, President Biden previously removed four commissioners appointed by Trump in 2021, including Justin Shubow, who advocated for traditional architecture.
