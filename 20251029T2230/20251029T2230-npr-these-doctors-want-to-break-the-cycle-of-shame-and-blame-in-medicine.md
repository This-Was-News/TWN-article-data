## Article summary
Physicians and researchers are advocating for "shame competence" training in medical education to address the pervasive culture of shame experienced by doctors and its negative impact on patient care. Dr. Will Bynum, who experienced intense shame during his residency, is a leading voice in this movement, arguing that learning to recognize and manage shame can foster healthier interactions. This effort aims to prevent physicians from inadvertently transmitting shame to patients, which can worsen health outcomes, lead to defensiveness, isolation, and substance use. The current U.S. political climate, with public officials blaming lifestyle choices for chronic conditions, exacerbates this issue, mirroring attitudes sometimes found in doctor's offices. Studies reveal that a significant portion of physicians feel repulsed by or hold negative views about patients with conditions like Type 2 diabetes, often attributing them to a lack of motivation or laziness. This can lead patients to avoid healthcare altogether, as exemplified by Christa Reed's two-decade hiatus from regular medical care due to weight-related lectures. Psychiatrist Savannah Woodward highlights that unacknowledged shame in physicians can lead to burnout, depression, and impaired patient care, as patients can sense a doctor's lack of confidence or well-being. A recent survey indicated that a substantial percentage of graduating medical students experienced public embarrassment or humiliation during their training. The intense scrutiny and high stakes of medical training, coupled with an inherent drive for perfectionism, can amplify feelings of inadequacy. Efforts are underway at institutions like Duke University, through initiatives like The Shame Lab, to train hundreds of physicians and residents in recognizing and mitigating shame. The goal is to reframe negative experiences as learning opportunities rather than personal failures, fostering kindness and support within the medical community. Ultimately, acknowledging and processing shame is seen as crucial for physicians' well-being and for providing compassionate, effective patient care.
