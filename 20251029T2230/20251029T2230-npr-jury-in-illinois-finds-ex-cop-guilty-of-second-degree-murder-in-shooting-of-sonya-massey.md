## Article summary
A downstate Peoria jury has convicted former Sangamon County Sheriff's Deputy Sean Grayson of second-degree murder for the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, an unarmed Black woman, in her home. The jury, comprised of nine women and three men, deliberated for parts of two days before reaching their verdict. Grayson had initially faced three counts of first-degree murder, but the jury opted for the lesser charge, which carries a potential sentence of four to 20 years in prison, avoiding a potential lifetime sentence. Massey's family, represented by attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, expressed that while they believed a first-degree murder conviction was warranted, the verdict represents a measure of justice and the beginning of accountability. They praised the Sangamon County prosecutors for their handling of the case. Grayson's sentencing is scheduled for late January. The verdict was met with tears from Massey's mother and sobs from her daughter, who felt the conviction should have been for first-degree murder. Attorneys for the Massey family stated they would continue to fight for the family and for reforms against the unlawful use of force.
