## Article summary
The Federal Reserve has reduced its key interest rate for the second time this year, aiming to stimulate economic growth and hiring amidst elevated inflation. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that future rate cuts are not guaranteed, citing significant disagreements among Fed officials and the disruption of economic data due to the government shutdown. The rate cut, a quarter of a point, brings the key rate down to approximately 3.9%. This move occurs as the Fed faces challenges of sluggish hiring and inflation remaining above its 2% target, further complicated by the lack of government economic reports. Financial markets reacted with some volatility to Powell's cautious remarks about future policy. Powell acknowledged that the limited data could lead the Fed to proceed more cautiously in its December meeting. Despite concerns about inflation, Powell suggested it is not far from the 2% goal when excluding tariff impacts. The economy might also be rebounding, potentially reducing the need for further rate cuts. Two officials dissented on the rate decision, one favoring no change and another advocating for a larger cut. Separately, the Fed will cease reducing its securities holdings starting December 1st, a move expected to have a minor impact on longer-term interest rates. The ongoing government shutdown continues to hinder the tracking of economic indicators like job growth and inflation.
