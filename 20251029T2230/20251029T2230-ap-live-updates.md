## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa has caused widespread devastation and claimed at least 32 lives across the Caribbean, impacting Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba. Initially making landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 storm, one of the strongest on record, Melissa has since weakened but continues to affect the southeastern Bahamas as a Category 1 storm. In Haiti, the southern coastal town of Petit-Goâve suffered immense damage, with 20 deaths and 10 missing, primarily due to flooding from a burst riverbank. Jamaica experienced catastrophic damage, with thousands evacuated to shelters, widespread power outages, and significant destruction to homes and infrastructure, including hospitals. Cuba evacuated hundreds of thousands to shelters, with eastern provinces reporting collapsed houses and blocked roads. International aid is being mobilized, with the U.S. and Britain sending rescue teams and humanitarian funding. Scientists note that Melissa's extreme rapid intensification is consistent with warming oceans, leading to more frequent severe weather events. While hurricane warnings have been dropped for Haiti and Cuba, the storm's impact continues to be felt as recovery efforts begin.
