## Article summary
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced that Mexico intends to send more water to the United States, but not immediately, amidst threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to increase tariffs on Mexican imports. Mexico is currently behind on its water deliveries from the Rio Grande River due to drought conditions and limitations in its pipeline infrastructure. Under a 1944 treaty, Mexico is obligated to deliver 1.7 million acre-feet of water to the U.S. every five years. Trump has publicly stated that Mexico has a water debt accumulated over five years, impacting Texas farmers, and has threatened a 5% tariff increase if the water is not released promptly. He specified a need for 200,000 acre-feet before December 31st, with the remainder to follow soon after. This is not the first time Trump has used tariffs as leverage in this water dispute, having made similar threats in April. Sheinbaum expressed Mexico's intention to fulfill its water obligations from previous years and conveyed hope for a renewed understanding between the two nations on this issue.
