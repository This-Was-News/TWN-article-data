## Article summary
Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is urging the Democratic Party to define itself by what it stands for, rather than solely by its opposition to Donald Trump. He argues that Democrats have become too aligned with the status quo and need to articulate a clearer policy agenda and sharper election messages. Van Hollen believes the party must actively fight back against what he describes as a "lawless president" at every opportunity. He emphasizes the need to support new voices within the party who are connecting with voters. Among his proposals to rebuild public trust, Van Hollen suggests a tax cut for working- and middle-class Americans. He acknowledges that grassroots groups are currently providing the energy for resistance against Trump in the absence of a single party leader. Van Hollen intends to be actively involved in shaping the Democratic Party's direction leading up to the 2028 election. He stated that the party needs to be clear about its positive vision for the future, not just its opposition to the current administration.
