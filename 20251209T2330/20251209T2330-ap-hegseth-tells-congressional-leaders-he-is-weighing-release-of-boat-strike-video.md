## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is considering whether to release full video of an attack on an alleged drug boat that resulted in the deaths of two survivors, facing increasing pressure from Congress for disclosure. Lawmakers, frustrated by a lack of information from the Pentagon, are demanding a full accounting of the strikes, which legal experts suggest may have violated laws governing the use of deadly military force. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer described a classified briefing on the matter as "very unsatisfying," emphasizing that all members of Congress have a right to view the video. Separately, Adm. Alvin Holsey, who is retiring early from his command of the campaign against drug boats near Venezuela, briefed key lawmakers. Congress, through its annual defense authorization bill, is demanding the Pentagon provide unedited video and orders for the strikes, threatening to withhold Hegseth's travel budget if he refuses. The Trump administration's campaign, which has struck 22 boats and killed at least 87 people since September, applies rules similar to the global war on terror to kill drug smugglers, asserting they pose a direct threat to American lives. Lawmakers question the intelligence used to determine the boats' cargo and destination, noting the destroyed boat in the Sept. 2 strike was heading south and its intelligence indicated it was en route to another vessel bound for Suriname. House Speaker Mike Johnson was the only leader to miss the classified briefing. A group of senators is preparing to force a vote on legislation to halt Trump's ability to use military force against Venezuela without congressional approval, citing renewed interest from GOP lawmakers amid escalating threats and scrutiny of the strike that killed survivors.
