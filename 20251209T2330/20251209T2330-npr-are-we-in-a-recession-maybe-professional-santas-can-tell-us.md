## Article summary
The demand for professional Santa Claus hires has seen a notable decline this holiday season, potentially signaling broader economic slowdowns. Mitch Allen, founder of Hire Santa, reports a nearly 27% year-to-date decrease in inquiries compared to last year, with last year also showing a dip from the previous one. This trend aligns with a general decrease in demand for seasonal workers, with hiring projected to be at its lowest point since 2009. Factors contributing to this include the shift of holiday shopping online and a struggling brick-and-mortar retail sector. Additionally, a spike in company layoffs, including those at major retailers and delivery services, further suggests a cooling labor market. The lack of comprehensive economic data due to recent government shutdowns makes it difficult to definitively assess the economy's state, but the decline in Santa hires is one of several indicators suggesting a potential downturn. While some sectors, like businesses using Santa to drive traffic, may remain recession-proof, private events and home visits are reportedly being scaled back by consumers. Despite the overall decrease, Allen assures that Santa is still coming to town, though perhaps with fewer appearances.
