## Article summary
Formal complaints have been filed with FIFA's ethics investigators concerning FIFA president Gianni Infantino's public support for Donald Trump and a peace prize awarded to the U.S. president. The London-based human rights nonprofit FairSquare claims Infantino breached FIFA's statutory duty to remain politically neutral. FIFA has stated that its ethics committee does not comment on ongoing cases and could not confirm receipt of the complaint. Violating the duty of neutrality can result in a ban from soccer for up to two years. Infantino has publicly backed Trump and his policies, suggesting he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. He has also closely aligned soccer with the U.S. government ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico. FairSquare argues that awarding a peace prize to a sitting political leader is a clear breach of FIFA's neutrality. They also suggested that if Infantino acted unilaterally without authority, it would be an abuse of power. FairSquare has a history of challenging FIFA on issues such as human rights records of World Cup hosts and FIFA governance standards.
