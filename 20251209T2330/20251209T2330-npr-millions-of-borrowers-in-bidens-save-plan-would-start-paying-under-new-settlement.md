## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Education has reached a proposed settlement to end the Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) student loan repayment plan. This plan, known for its flexibility and low $0 payments for some borrowers, faced legal challenges from Republican state attorneys general who argued it was too generous. The legal battles have left millions of SAVE borrowers in limbo, with interest resuming on their loans in August. The proposed agreement, pending court approval, would halt new enrollments in SAVE, deny pending applications, and transition the approximately 7 million current SAVE borrowers to other repayment plans. Borrowers will have a limited time to choose between fixed payment plans or income-based plans. Two new plans, a revised standard plan and a new income-driven plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, are set to roll out in July 2026 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but SAVE borrowers are expected to switch plans before then. This transition is expected to be challenging for loan servicing companies, as many borrowers have not been in repayment for years and will have numerous questions. Critics argue that ending the SAVE plan will make life more expensive for borrowers, especially as millions are already struggling with payments and are on the edge of default.
