## Article summary
Joan Brugge, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, has been investigating breast cancer prevention by analyzing donated breast tissue samples. Her lab identified specific "seed cells" in breast tissue that contain the genetic precursors to tumors, a discovery made possible by a $7 million federal grant. However, this crucial research was significantly disrupted when the National Cancer Institute (NIH) froze funding to Harvard researchers over the university's handling of antisemitism on campus. This freeze led to staff layoffs and the inability to apply for renewed grants, jeopardizing the project's future. Despite the restoration of funding flow, the missed renewal deadline means Brugge's current grant ends in August, forcing her to seek private funding. The uncertainty surrounding federal research funding, with proposed budget cuts to the NIH, raises concerns about the future of cancer research and drug development in the U.S. Brugge's lab also faces challenges in hiring foreign researchers due to new visa fees. The disruptions not only impact scientific progress but also the careers of young researchers, with potential long-term consequences for cancer treatment advancements.
