## Article summary
The current artificial intelligence (A.I.) boom in Silicon Valley shares similarities with the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, including widespread enthusiasm, rapid wealth creation, and inflated company valuations. However, significant differences suggest a potentially different outcome. Unlike the dot-com era's numerous startups, the A.I. boom is largely financed and controlled by established, financially stable tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. The internet's adoption was gradual, requiring new infrastructure, whereas A.I. is being embraced more readily by businesses. Regulatory hurdles for A.I. are also minimal compared to the antitrust actions of the 1990s. Interestingly, the public discussion about a potential A.I. bubble might, paradoxically, indicate that a full-blown bubble has not yet formed, as true bubble capitulation is marked by a lack of skepticism. While both booms concentrated investment in a single sector, the scale of the A.I. boom is vastly larger, with companies like Nvidia valued far higher than the peak valuations of dot-com era tech leaders. The dot-com boom was a more populist movement, attracting individuals seeking fortune, whereas A.I. is a less accessible phenomenon, demanding specialized expertise. A.I. is considered a computer technology that can provide immediate value, unlike the internet, which required network effects and user adoption to mature. While the potential for fraud exists, similar to the dot-com era, current A.I. deals are viewed differently by analysts, with capital actively seeking A.I. rather than the other way around. Despite potential risks and out-of-whack valuations in private markets, the underlying value and rapid adoption of A.I. suggest this boom may indeed be different.
