## Article summary
A daylight heist at the Louvre, where nine priceless jewels were stolen in under seven minutes, quickly transitioned from a real-life crime to internet sensation. The audacity of the theft, compared to movie plots, sparked a wave of memes and viral marketing campaigns. Brands like Böcker and IKEA released cheeky advertisements referencing the heist, while social media users created Halloween costumes inspired by the thieves. The fascination stems from the fantasy of a successful, daring crime, offering a more appealing narrative than tragic news. Even Hollywood joined in, with George Clooney joking about the heist during a film premiere. A viral image of a well-dressed passerby near the Louvre was dubbed a suave detective, further fueling the meme culture surrounding the event. The Paris prosecutor's office even played along with the online speculation. Meanwhile, French police are actively investigating, analyzing over 150 trace samples, including DNA and fingerprints, in an effort to recover the missing jewels, valued at approximately $102 million.
