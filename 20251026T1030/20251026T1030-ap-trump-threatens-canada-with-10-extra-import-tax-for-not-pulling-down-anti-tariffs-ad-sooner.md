## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced plans to impose an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods in response to an anti-tariff advertisement aired by the province of Ontario. The ad, which used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan, angered Trump, who accused Ontario of misrepresenting facts and acting hostilely. Trump stated he would end trade talks with Canada over the ad, although Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to pull it after the weekend. The White House did not immediately clarify the specifics of the new tariff, including its effective date or scope. Canada's federal minister responsible for trade issues with the U.S. emphasized that trade negotiations are handled by the federal government, not provincial leaders. Canada's economy has been significantly impacted by Trump's tariffs, with a large portion of its exports going to the U.S. Trump also expressed no intention of meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at an upcoming summit in Malaysia. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions over trade policy and the use of tariffs.
