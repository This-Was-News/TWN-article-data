## Article summary
A number of suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of crown jewels from Paris' Louvre museum last weekend, according to the Paris prosecutor. Investigators made the arrests on Saturday evening, with one suspect reportedly preparing to leave the country. The jewels, valued at 88 million euros ($102 million), were stolen in a heist that took less than eight minutes. Intruders used a basket lift to scale the museum's facade, forced open a window, smashed display cases, and fled. The museum's director described the incident as a terrible failure. The arrests were made by the anti-gang brigade. The prosecutor expressed regret over the premature leak of information, stating it could hinder the work of over 100 investigators. The investigation aims to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all perpetrators.
