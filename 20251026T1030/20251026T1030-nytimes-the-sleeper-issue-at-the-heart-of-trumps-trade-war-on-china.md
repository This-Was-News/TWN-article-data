## Article summary
Southeast Asian nations are increasingly concerned about a "sleeper issue" in President Trump's trade strategy: the definition of a product's origin. This definition is crucial for Trump's aim to reduce China's role in global manufacturing supply chains. Companies and officials are awaiting clarity on how the U.S. will determine the nationality of goods that contain parts from multiple countries. Southeast Asia is particularly vulnerable, as billions of dollars in goods flow through the region from China. While Trump has announced trade agreements with some Southeast Asian countries, these lack specific details on origin criteria. The U.S. administration has proposed a "rule of origin" target of 30% foreign content, a threshold many regional products may struggle to meet. This uncertainty could jeopardize existing trade agreements and lead to hefty tariffs, potentially as high as 40%. Companies are seeking clarity on what constitutes foreign content, including investment, machinery, or labor. The lack of clear guidelines creates a dilemma for Southeast Asian governments, balancing the threat of steep tariffs with the need for concrete trade agreements. This situation also impacts the broader strategic stability of the region, as countries rely on the U.S. as a balance to China.
