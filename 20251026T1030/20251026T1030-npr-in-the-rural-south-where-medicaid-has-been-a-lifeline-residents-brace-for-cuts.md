## Article summary
In rural areas of the South, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi, residents are bracing for significant cuts to Medicaid, a program that has become a vital lifeline for many. Lake Providence, Louisiana, a town once thriving, now faces economic hardship with dilapidated buildings and limited industry. Medicaid expansion in 2016 significantly lowered the uninsured rate in Louisiana, making healthcare accessible to low-income individuals who previously struggled to afford it. However, a new federal tax and spending bill includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade, potentially leading to millions losing health coverage nationwide. In Louisiana alone, an estimated 317,000 low-income residents could lose coverage. The law introduces new work reporting requirements and more frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid expansion enrollees, set to take effect in 2027. These changes are causing anxiety among residents like Sherila Ervin and Nevada Qualls, who worry about accidentally losing their coverage due to administrative hurdles. Healthcare providers and community leaders express concern that these cuts will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and reverse the progress made in expanding healthcare access. While a rural health fund is included in the bill, its effectiveness in offsetting cuts and keeping rural hospitals open remains uncertain. The situation has led to feelings of distress and a sense of disconnect between policymakers and the realities faced by those relying on Medicaid.
