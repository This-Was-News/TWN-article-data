## Article summary
President Trump is embarking on a nearly week-long trip to Asia, with a key focus on trade negotiations and diplomatic engagements. The itinerary includes meetings with leaders in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. A significant event will be Trump presiding over a peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, an outcome he has been touting as a personal success. In South Korea, he is set to meet with President Lee Jae Myung to finalize trade details and potentially discuss North Korea, with Trump expressing openness to meeting Kim Jong Un. The trip also involves meeting Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi. The most anticipated event is a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit. This meeting occurs amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, including China's recent restrictions on rare earth minerals. Despite these tensions, Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a deal with Xi. However, experts suggest the meeting may primarily serve to extend a trade truce rather than achieve a breakthrough agreement, as both sides remain firm in their positions.
