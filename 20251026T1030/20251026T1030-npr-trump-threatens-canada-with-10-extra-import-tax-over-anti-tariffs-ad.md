## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced plans to increase tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10%. This decision stems from an anti-tariff television advertisement aired by the province of Ontario, which Trump deemed a "misrepresentation of the facts" and a "hostile act." The ad utilized words from former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs, reportedly angering Trump. Ontario Premier Doug Ford stated the ad would be removed after the weekend, but it had already aired during the World Series. It remains unclear when the tariff hike will take effect or if it will apply to all Canadian goods. Canada's economy is significantly impacted by Trump's existing tariffs, with over 75% of its exports going to the U.S. Some Canadian products already face a 35% tariff, with steel and aluminum at 50%. Trump indicated he would not meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at an upcoming summit in Malaysia. Trump also claimed the ad misrepresented Reagan's stance on tariffs, despite Reagan's known wariness of them. The President expressed concern that the ad was intended to influence an upcoming Supreme Court case regarding his authority to impose tariffs.
