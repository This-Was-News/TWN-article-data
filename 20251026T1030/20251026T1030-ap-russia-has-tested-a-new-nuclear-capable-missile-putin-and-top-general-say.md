## Article summary
Russia has successfully tested a new nuclear-capable cruise missile, the Burevestnik, which President Vladimir Putin claims is capable of bypassing existing missile defenses due to its unlimited range and unpredictable flight path. During a meeting with top military officials, Gen. Valery Gerasimov reported that the missile completed a 14,000-kilometer test flight lasting 15 hours, with Putin indicating this is not its maximum range. Putin instructed Gerasimov to conduct final tests and prepare for the weapon's deployment to the armed forces. This development follows recent strategic nuclear force drills ordered by Putin, which included practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles, cruise missiles fired by strategic bombers, and simulated launches from a submarine. These drills involved all components of Russia's nuclear triad and aimed to test the capabilities of military command structures. The timing of these exercises coincides with a pause in planned summits on Ukraine with U.S. President Donald Trump.
