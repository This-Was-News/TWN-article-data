## Article summary
During his visit to Malaysia for the ASEAN summit, U.S. President Donald Trump attended a ceasefire ceremony between Thailand and Cambodia. This agreement, spurred by Trump's threats of economic pressure, involves the release of Cambodian prisoners and the withdrawal of heavy artillery. Trump hailed it as a historic achievement, while Cambodian and Thai leaders expressed optimism for lasting peace. The trip also provided an opportunity for Trump to pursue economic agreements, particularly to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals. He expressed confidence in reaching a deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later in his trip. The summit also saw Trump discussing potential tariff reductions with Brazilian President Lula da Silva, while avoiding Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney due to trade disputes. The U.S. aims to strengthen supply chains and cooperate with ASEAN nations, whose combined economy is significant. The ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia is seen by some as a strategic move for Trump to bolster his image as an international dealmaker, potentially in pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize. While Trump has a history of claiming credit for resolving conflicts, the long-term impact of his diplomatic efforts remains to be seen.
