## Article summary
The current government shutdown, already the second-longest in history, has evolved from a mechanism to enforce federal law into a tool for President Donald Trump to assert greater executive power. Initially, in 1980, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti used the Antideficiency Act of 1870 to argue that government spending must cease when congressional authority expires. However, in this shutdown, Trump has leveraged the funding lapse to target Democrats, initiate layoffs of federal workers, and reallocate the federal budget to align with his priorities. Civiletti himself expressed surprise that shutdowns would become such a prolonged political tactic. Following periods with no lengthy shutdowns, the 1990s saw dramatic standoffs between Republicans and President Bill Clinton, which historians largely view as unsuccessful for the GOP. A significant shutdown occurred in 2013 under President Barack Obama, but it was during Trump's term that Democrats began employing extended shutdowns. Unlike previous administrations that applied shutdown rules uniformly, the Trump administration has exercised a more "freewheeling presidential appropriation power." This approach has introduced a political dimension, with agencies blaming Democrats and funds being redirected. Trump has even boasted about cutting Democratic priorities. Democrats, however, remain resolute, believing voters will hold Republicans accountable and seeing the fight as a stand against the expansion of presidential power. The prolonged shutdown is causing significant hardship, with federal employees unpaid, essential programs like SNAP facing funding issues, and critical services like air traffic control being impacted.
