## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa is expected to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane by Sunday, posing a significant threat to the Caribbean. The storm is projected to bring life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides to Jamaica and southern Hispaniola, including Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Currently a category two hurricane with 100 mph winds, its slow movement is anticipated to prolong dangerous impacts over several days. A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti, and a hurricane warning is issued for Jamaica, where officials warn it could be worse than previous major storms. The National Hurricane Center forecasts 15-30 inches of rain in Jamaica and southern Hispaniola, with some areas potentially receiving up to 40 inches. Jamaica's National Water Commission has activated emergency protocols, and hospitals will be prioritized for water supply if disruptions occur. Flooding may also displace crocodiles from waterways. Tragically, at least one death has been reported in the Dominican Republic due to heavy rainfall, and three deaths are reported in Haiti from a landslide and falling tree. Eastern Cuba, the Southeast Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos Islands are urged to monitor the storm closely, with the U.S. Navy ordering non-essential personnel to evacuate Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Hurricane conditions are expected in eastern Cuba from Tuesday into Wednesday, with rainfall totals potentially exceeding one foot.
