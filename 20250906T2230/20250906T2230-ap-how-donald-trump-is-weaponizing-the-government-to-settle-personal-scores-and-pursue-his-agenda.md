## Article summary
President Donald Trump, known for his deal-making approach, has been using his second term to amass and wield government power against various entities and individuals he dislikes. He has deployed federal agents, threatened deployments in Democratic-run cities, and fired officials, including a Federal Reserve governor. Trump has targeted universities, media organizations, law firms, and even sports teams, using tactics like revoking security clearances, blocking research funds, and pursuing legal actions. His administration has also dropped charges against allies and pursued investigations into political opponents. Despite campaigning against government weaponization, Trump has embraced it, claiming to end it while actively using state power to pursue his agenda. His actions have been supported by a loyal base and a Congress and Supreme Court that have ceded power to the executive branch. Trump's approach exemplifies a radical use of power, including spreading misinformation and shaping public discourse through memes and jokes.
