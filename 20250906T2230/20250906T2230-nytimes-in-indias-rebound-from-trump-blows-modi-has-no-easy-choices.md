## Article summary
Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, after facing setbacks with former U.S. President Trump over trade tariffs, sought to strengthen ties with Russia and China, signaling a shift in India's foreign policy. Modi's absence from a Chinese military parade highlighted India's cautious approach towards China, despite their shared border disputes and economic rivalry. India's foreign policy has traditionally balanced relationships with multiple countries, but Modi's recent alignment with the U.S. has faced challenges, particularly under Trump's administration. The strained U.S.-India relations have pushed India to avoid public confrontations with U.S. officials while seeking opportunities to improve ties. Modi's strategy mirrors his response to Chinese aggression in the past, maintaining a delicate balance. Despite the downturn in U.S. relations, India remains wary of China's intentions and seeks to reduce its dependence on Chinese imports. Trump's fluctuating statements on India have further complicated the relationship, with Indian officials focusing on positive aspects. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on India, citing its purchases of Russian oil, which has strained relations. Indian officials privately express concerns about long-term damage to U.S.-India relations, highlighting the unpredictability of U.S. policies. India's economic resilience and diverse trade relations provide some confidence in standing firm. The centralization of power in Trump's second term has made it difficult for India to communicate effectively with the White House, reducing the influence of Indian-Americans in bridging the gap. The political climate in the U.S. has made it challenging for supporters of India to advocate for stronger ties without facing backlash from Trump's base.
