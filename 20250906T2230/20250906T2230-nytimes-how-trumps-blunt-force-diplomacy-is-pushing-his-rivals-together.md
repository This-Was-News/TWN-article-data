## Article summary
President Trump has expressed concern over India and Russia aligning with China, marking a shift in global alliances. Trump's blunt diplomacy and punitive tariffs have strained relations with India, pushing it closer to China. India's Prime Minister Modi visited China for the first time in seven years, meeting with Chinese and Russian leaders, signaling a potential strategic realignment. Trump downplayed the rift with India but acknowledged discontent over Modi's actions. Experts suggest India's move towards China is driven by frustration with U.S. policies. Trump's strong-arm tactics, successful in domestic politics, have backfired internationally, alienating key allies. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting highlighted this shift, with several U.S. partners attending. Trump's approach has accelerated the aggregation of aggrieved states, challenging U.S. global leadership. Analysts warn that strained U.S.-India relations could benefit China. India's historical aversion to being dictated to by foreign powers further complicates the situation. Despite tensions, experts believe India values its relationship with the U.S. and could be won back.
