## Article summary
The U.S. government plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Eswatini despite his fear of deportation to Uganda. ICE stated that his fear of persecution or torture in Uganda is hard to take seriously, given his claims of fear in 22 other countries. Eswatini's government has not received any communication regarding his transfer. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man, lived in Maryland for over a decade before being mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year, sparking contentious court battles. He has an American wife and child and was initially deported due to an administrative error. The Trump administration returned him to the U.S. in June but charged him with human smuggling. ICE now seeks to deport him again, while Abrego Garcia is requesting asylum in the U.S. His 2019 asylum request was denied, but his attorney believes he is now eligible. If allowed a fair trial, his attorney is confident he will succeed in his asylum claim.
