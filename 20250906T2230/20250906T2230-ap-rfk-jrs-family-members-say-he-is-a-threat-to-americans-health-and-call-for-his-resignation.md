## Article summary
Members of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s family, including his sister Kerry Kennedy and nephew Joseph P. Kennedy III, are calling for his resignation as health secretary following a contentious congressional hearing. They argue that his leadership poses a threat to Americans' health and well-being. The family's statements come after Kennedy defended his efforts to roll back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and fire high-level officials at the Centers for Disease Control during a Senate hearing. This is not the first time Kennedy has faced opposition from his family, who previously objected to his presidential run and nomination as health secretary due to his views on vaccines. As a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement, Kennedy has implemented significant changes in public health policies and vaccine guidelines, leading to thousands of layoffs and causing concern among medical groups and officials in Democratic-led states.
