## Article summary
Federal agents arrested 475 people, mostly South Korean nationals, at a Hyundai Motor Group electric vehicle battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. South Korea's Foreign Minister expressed deep concern and called for swift resolution, while President Lee Jae Myung emphasized protecting the rights of South Korean nationals and businesses. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) described the operation as the largest single-site enforcement action in its history, aiming to protect American jobs and uphold federal laws. The arrests have strained U.S.-South Korea relations, particularly as Hyundai plans significant investments in the U.S. President Trump supported the raids, while Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock criticized the operation and the companies' employment practices. Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are investigating the incident, with LG suspending U.S. business trips and dispatching its chief HR officer to address the issues. Georgia officials defended the operation, emphasizing the enforcement of immigration laws, while Republican Congressman Buddy Carter praised the action as a step to protect American workers.
