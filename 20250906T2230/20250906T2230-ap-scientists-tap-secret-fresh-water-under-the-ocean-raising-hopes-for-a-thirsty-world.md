## Article summary
Scientists have discovered a massive, hidden aquifer of fresh water beneath the ocean off the coast of Cape Cod, stretching from New Jersey to Maine. Expedition 501, a global research project, drilled thousands of samples from this aquifer, which could potentially provide a significant water source for a world facing increasing water scarcity. The water's origin is still a mystery, with possibilities including glacial melt, connected groundwater systems, or a combination. The potential is enormous, but challenges include extraction, ownership, and environmental impact. The discovery comes as global demand for fresh water is projected to exceed supply by 40% in just five years. The research team will analyze the water's properties, including its safety for consumption and its potential as a renewable resource. The project is a collaboration of over a dozen countries, backed by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling. The discovery could have significant implications for water management and policy, but further research is needed to understand the potential consequences of tapping into these underwater aquifers.
