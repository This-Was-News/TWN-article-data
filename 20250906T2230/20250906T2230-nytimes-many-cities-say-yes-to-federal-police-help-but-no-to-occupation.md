## Article summary
Many mayors and police chiefs express openness to traditional federal law enforcement cooperation but resist the deployment of the National Guard. In 2020, President Trump sent federal agents to Kansas City, which Mayor Quinton Lucas initially opposed but later endorsed parts of Operation Legend for its effectiveness in reducing crime. Mayor Lucas now supports targeted federal help, such as keeping guns from abusers and tracing bullets. While many leaders oppose using the military for domestic law enforcement, they welcome federal agents' assistance in tracking guns, conducting surveillance, and capturing fugitives. Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina successfully collaborated with the National Guard, emphasizing careful planning and mutual respect. Concerns arise about unplanned federal surges and potential conflicts with local desires, such as deporting undocumented residents. Operation Legend's impact is debated, with over 6,000 arrests and 2,600 guns seized, though its effectiveness is questioned. Chicago's Mayor Brandon Johnson resists Trump's plans, advocating for local control but supporting federal collaboration in gun and drug cases. Experts caution that more police or federal agents do not always mean better outcomes, and forced deployments can backfire. Mayor Jerry Dyer of Fresno emphasizes the importance of community buy-in and tailored approaches to crime reduction.
