## Article summary
The Trump administration plans to release a report linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy and certain vitamin deficiencies to autism spectrum disorder, despite lacking scientific evidence. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously made unsupported claims about autism. The HHS confirmed they are working on a report but declined to comment on its conclusions. There is no credible scientific evidence that acetaminophen causes autism or that leucovorin can prevent it. Medical experts, including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, state that acetaminophen is safe and recommended for use during pregnancy. Dr. Alyca Halladay of the Autism Science Foundation emphasizes that autism's causes are complex and not reducible to a single factor. Small studies suggest a possible link between fetal exposure to acetaminophen and autism or ADHD, but the largest study found no increased risk. Leucovorin, a form of vitamin B9, is sometimes used off-label for autism treatment, though evidence is limited. Folate is crucial for brain development, and deficiencies can increase the risk of neural tube defects, but the link to autism remains unclear. The Autism Science Foundation notes that more research is needed to understand the potential connection between low folate levels and autism.
