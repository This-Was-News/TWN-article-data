## Article summary
Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has confirmed that her office filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Mike Johnson for not swearing in Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva. Grijalva, who succeeded her father, the late U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, was elected by Southern Arizona voters. Mayes' office had previously sent Johnson a letter demanding a date for Grijalva's swearing-in, but the deadline was not met. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., seeks to ensure Grijalva's swearing-in, allowing her to represent her district and participate in congressional activities. Democrats, including Grijalva, accuse Johnson of delaying the swearing-in to prevent a vote on releasing U.S. Justice Department files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Johnson denies these accusations and has stated that he will administer the oath of office after the Senate votes to reopen the government. Grijalva has pledged to support the release of the Epstein investigation documents, which would require her signature to force a vote. The lawsuit also requests that if Johnson refuses, another authorized person can swear in Grijalva. The special election for Congressional District 7 saw a turnout of about 23%, with Grijalva winning approximately 69% of the vote.
