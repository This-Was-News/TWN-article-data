## Article summary
Election officials from nearly all 50 states were alarmed after a call with Heather Honey, the new deputy assistant secretary for election integrity, who echoed right-wing rhetoric about the 2020 election. Honey, a former leader in the election denial movement, criticized the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity experts for allegedly straying from their mission and mentioned a report often cited by election conspiracists. Her appointment reflects Trump's ongoing fixation on his 2020 election grievances and his use of government powers to challenge the electoral system. Trump has elevated multiple proponents of his fraud claims into high-level administration jobs, potentially allowing them to discredit future election results or argue for federal intervention in local voting systems.
