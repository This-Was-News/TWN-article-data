## Article summary
President Trump is demanding that the Justice Department pay him approximately $230 million in compensation for federal investigations into him. This unprecedented situation involves potential ethical conflicts, as senior department officials who previously defended Trump or his associates are now in positions to approve any such payout. Trump submitted administrative claims seeking damages for investigations into Russian election interference and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago. He has accused the FBI and Justice Department of violating his privacy and engaging in malicious prosecution. The president has stated that any money he receives would be donated to charity, acknowledging the unusual nature of the situation. Legal experts and former officials have raised concerns about the ethical implications and the potential for conflicts of interest. The Justice Department's regulations require high-level approval for settlements over $4 million, and key officials involved have past ties to Trump. The administration has not publicly announced plans to reject Trump's claims, and there may be no official declaration if a settlement is reached.
