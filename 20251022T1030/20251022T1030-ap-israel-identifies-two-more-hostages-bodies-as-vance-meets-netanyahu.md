## Article summary
Israel has identified the bodies of two more hostages killed in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The remains of Arie Zalmanovich and Tamir Adar were returned to Israel, where a military ceremony was planned. U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog to discuss the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. Since the ceasefire began, the remains of 15 hostages have been returned to Israel, with 13 still to be recovered. Meanwhile, the burial of 54 Palestinians is set for the day, with some bodies showing signs of torture. Vance expressed optimism about the ceasefire but acknowledged ongoing challenges, including the composition of an international security force and the governance of Gaza. Additionally, a Palestinian charity reported an armed takeover of one of its facilities in Gaza, urging authorities to intervene. Israelis prepared to bid farewell to a Thai hostage killed in the 2023 attack, with his body to be repatriated to Thailand.
