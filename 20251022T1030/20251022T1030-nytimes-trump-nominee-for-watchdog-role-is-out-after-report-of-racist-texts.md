## Article summary
Paul Ingrassia, a far-right lawyer and podcaster, was nominated by President Trump to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an agency tasked with fighting corruption. His nomination faced significant opposition from at least four Republican senators, including the majority leader, due to his controversial past and a recent report of racist text messages. Ingrassia had previously pushed a fake theory about Nikki Haley's eligibility to run for president and hosted a far-right podcast. The racist texts reportedly used derogatory language to describe holidays honoring Black Americans and expressed distrust towards ethnically Chinese and Indian people. Facing insufficient Republican support, Ingrassia withdrew his nomination. The controversy also highlighted broader issues within the Republican Party, including the use of racist and homophobic language by young officeholders and activists. Ingrassia, who described himself as a constitutional law expert, stated he would continue to serve the Trump administration. The White House confirmed his withdrawal but did not address whether he would retain his current role as a liaison with the Department of Homeland Security.
