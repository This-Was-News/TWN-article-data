## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown has entered its third week with no resolution in sight, affecting federal employees, national parks, and various services across the country. The shutdown began due to a partisan dispute over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. Republicans and Democrats remain gridlocked, with Republicans tying the shutdown to reducing the size of the government and Democrats pushing for healthcare program protections. Federal employees will miss their first full paycheck, though they are legally entitled to back pay once the shutdown ends. President Trump has threatened mass layoffs, and some federal workers are fighting back in court. Essential services like the U.S. Postal Service and air traffic control continue, but other programs like WIC and SNAP face funding issues. National parks are partially open but with limited services, and some communities are stepping in to keep critical facilities operational. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security benefits continue, but some services are disrupted. Immigration enforcement and air travel are mostly unaffected, but staffing shortages are causing flight delays.
