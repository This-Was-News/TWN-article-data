## Article summary
North Carolina is set to redraw its congressional districts, aiming to secure more seats for Republicans ahead of the midterm elections. The proposed map, which targets the state's only swing district, has sparked controversy for potentially diluting the voting power of Black residents. Republicans argue that the changes are necessary to maintain their slim majority in the U.S. House. The new map is part of a broader national battle between Republicans and Democrats to gain congressional seats. North Carolina has seen frequent redistricting due to legal challenges, with this being the seventh map since 2016. The current proposal follows a Supreme Court ruling that allowed for partisan gerrymandering. The state Senate has approved the plan, and final passage is expected. The move is part of a larger trend, with other states like Texas and California also redrawing districts to favor their respective parties.
