## Article summary
President Donald Trump asserted that the federal government owes him substantial money for past investigations into his conduct. He claimed he would have the final say on any payout, as any decision would need to go across his desk. Trump's comments followed a New York Times report about his administrative claims seeking roughly $230 million in damages. These claims are related to the FBI's 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago property for classified documents and a separate investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump suggested he could donate any taxpayer money or use it for personal projects. The status of these claims and any negotiations within the Justice Department were unclear. Trump's lead defense lawyer in the Mar-a-Lago investigation, Todd Blanche, is now the deputy attorney general. The claims were filed to resolve federal complaints through settlements and avoid litigation. One claim alleges malicious prosecution by the Biden administration, while the other seeks damages related to the Trump-Russia investigation.
