## Article summary
A web page discusses how reversing previous advice on peanut consumption has significantly reduced peanut allergy cases among young children. For many years, parents were advised to avoid giving babies peanut products to prevent allergies. However, a 2015 study found that early introduction of peanuts actually reduced the likelihood of developing allergies. This led to a change in pediatric guidelines, resulting in a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% reduction in overall food allergy prevalence among children under 3 in the U.S. The shift in guidelines has prevented tens of thousands of peanut allergy cases over the past decade. The change was influenced by research showing that Israeli children, who were routinely fed peanut snacks, had lower allergy rates compared to their British and American counterparts. The revised recommendations now suggest introducing peanut products to high-risk infants as early as 4 to 6 months. Despite some limitations in the study, experts agree that the strategic shift has been beneficial, as peanut allergies are often lifelong conditions.
