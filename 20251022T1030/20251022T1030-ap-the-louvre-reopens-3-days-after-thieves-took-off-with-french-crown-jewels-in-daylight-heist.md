## Article summary
The Louvre reopened three days after a daring daylight heist where thieves stole eight pieces from France's Crown Jewels, including items linked to Marie-Amélie, Hortense, Marie-Louise, and Empress Eugénie. The theft, occurring just 250 meters from the Mona Lisa, has sparked national concern and questions about the museum's security. The thieves spent less than four minutes inside, using a freight lift and motorbikes for their escape. The stolen jewels are valued at approximately €88 million, but their historical significance is immeasurable. Authorities have identified four individuals present at the scene and are investigating. The heist has highlighted issues of overcrowding and understaffing, with unions arguing that mass tourism strains resources. The Louvre's security measures are under scrutiny, particularly after recent upgrades were announced. Despite the breach, the museum's other major attractions remained open, but the Apollo Gallery, where the theft occurred, remained sealed off.
