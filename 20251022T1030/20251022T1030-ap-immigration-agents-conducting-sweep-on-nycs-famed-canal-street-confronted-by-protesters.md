## Article summary
A chaotic scene unfolded on Manhattan's Canal Street when immigration agents conducted a sweep targeting vendors selling counterfeit goods. The operation, involving agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol, led to arrests and confrontations with protesters who attempted to block the agents. The confrontation began around 4 p.m. in Chinatown, a known market for knock-off items. Protesters, many of whom were passing by, surrounded the agents, shouting slogans and attempting to impede their actions. Federal agents responded by pushing protesters and threatening the use of pepper spray, leading to further escalation. The sweep followed a video shared by a conservative influencer, highlighting the sale of counterfeit goods. Mayor Eric Adams condemned the operation, emphasizing that undocumented immigrants should not be the target of law enforcement. The New York Immigration Coalition accused the Trump administration of creating a violent spectacle to terrorize immigrant communities.
