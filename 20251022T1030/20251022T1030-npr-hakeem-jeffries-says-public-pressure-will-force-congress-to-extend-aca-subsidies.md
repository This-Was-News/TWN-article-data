## Article summary
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries believes public pressure will force Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are crucial for over 20 million people to afford health insurance. The government shutdown continues as Democrats insist on extending these subsidies, which expire at the end of the year, just as open enrollment begins. Jeffries argues that without the subsidies, health insurance premiums will skyrocket, making coverage unaffordable for many. He opposes a one-year extension proposed by some Republicans, advocating instead for a more permanent solution. Jeffries also criticizes a GOP bill to pay military and essential federal workers, calling it a political ploy that gives the president too much discretion. He emphasizes the need for a comprehensive reopening of the government and a bipartisan agreement that benefits all Americans.
