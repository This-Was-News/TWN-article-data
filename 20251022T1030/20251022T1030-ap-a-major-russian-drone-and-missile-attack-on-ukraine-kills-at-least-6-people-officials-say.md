## Article summary
A major Russian drone and missile attack across Ukraine resulted in the deaths of at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters, and injured at least 18 others in Kyiv. The attack targeted multiple Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure, causing rolling blackouts. The assault occurred as U.S.-led efforts to end the war faltered, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy appealed for more military aid. Zelenskyy urged international partners to apply pressure on Russia through sanctions, long-range capabilities, and coordinated diplomacy. He credited U.S. President Trump's consideration of supplying Tomahawk missiles for Putin's willingness to engage in talks. Zelenskyy is set to engage in a week of intense diplomacy, starting with a visit to Stockholm. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to discuss NATO's support for Ukraine with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The attack caused significant damage in several Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, and highlighted the ongoing conflict's impact on civilian areas.
