## Article summary
The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their groundbreaking research into quantum mechanical tunneling. Clarke, surprised by the honor, praised his co-laureates' contributions, noting their work as foundational for quantum computing. The Nobel committee highlighted the laureates' research as pivotal for advancing quantum technology, including cryptography, computers, and sensors. Clarke mentioned that their discoveries underpin the functionality of modern cellphones. The prize underscores the ongoing relevance and utility of quantum mechanics, which is the bedrock of digital technology. This marks the 119th awarding of the physics prize, following last year's recognition of AI pioneers. The Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday, with the Peace Prize and economics prize to follow. The award ceremony will be held on December 10, commemorating the death of Alfred Nobel, the prizes' founder. The laureates receive a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to nearly $1.2 million.
