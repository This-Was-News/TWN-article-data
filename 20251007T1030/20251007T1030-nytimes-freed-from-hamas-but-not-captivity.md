## Article summary
Emily Damari was taken hostage by Hamas during an attack on her kibbutz in Israel, enduring 471 days of captivity. She was freed in January 2025 during a cease-fire and emerged with injuries, including missing fingers, which she symbolized with a unique V-sign. She faced months of rehabilitation and surgery. Damari now lives a different life, filled with gratitude and a new partner, Danielle Amit. She remains connected to her friend Romi Gonen, another former hostage. Damari advocates for the freedom of remaining hostages and shares her story to inspire hope. She reflects on her past life in Kfar Aza and the trauma of her captivity, including being moved around Gaza and enduring harsh conditions. Despite her freedom, she feels guilt for those still held captive and is determined to raise awareness about their plight.
