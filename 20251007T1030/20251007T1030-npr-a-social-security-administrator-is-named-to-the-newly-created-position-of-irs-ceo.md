## Article summary
Frank Bisignano, the Social Security Administration Commissioner, has been appointed as the new CEO of the IRS, a role created by the Trump administration. He will oversee daily IRS operations while continuing his role at the SSA, reporting to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The move raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the effectiveness of managing two major agencies simultaneously. Critics, including advocates for Social Security and tax law experts, have expressed apprehension about the appointment, citing issues such as avoiding Senate confirmation and the complexity of managing both roles. Bisignano's dual roles add to the leadership changes at the IRS, which has seen multiple acting commissioners since Trump's term began. The appointment also highlights the trend of Trump administration officials holding multiple positions. Bisignano's background includes serving as CEO of Fiserv and advocating for LGBTQ+ protections.
