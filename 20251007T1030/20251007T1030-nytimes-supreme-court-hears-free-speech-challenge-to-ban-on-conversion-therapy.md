## Article summary
The Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to a Colorado law that prohibits licensed mental health professionals from performing conversion therapy on minors. The law, passed in 2019, aims to protect young people from ineffective and potentially harmful practices. Kaley Chiles, a therapist, argues that the law violates her free speech rights. The case's outcome could impact over 20 other states with similar laws. The justices must decide if the law regulates professional conduct or infringes on free speech. Colorado officials argue the law protects patients from substandard care. The Supreme Court has recently ruled in favor of religious freedoms in similar cases. The conversion therapy case is part of a broader debate on medical treatments for transgender youth and religious exemptions. Chiles disputes medical associations' findings on the risks of conversion therapy. The First Amendment's role in regulating professional speech is a key issue. The lower courts are split on the matter, with the Tenth Circuit upholding Colorado's law.
