## Article summary
The federal government shut down in October 2025 due to a failure to reach a funding deal, coinciding with the open enrollment season for health insurance. Democrats are using the shutdown to pressure Republicans into extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, which have significantly lowered premiums for millions of Americans. Without the extension, premiums are expected to more than double, affecting around 24 million enrollees. Julio Fuentes, CEO of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, warned that Hispanic voters, who helped elect Republicans, could turn away if affordable healthcare is not maintained. Democrats see this as an opportunity to highlight healthcare affordability, while Republicans are confident in their stance. The shutdown also impacts federal workers, public health agencies, and food assistance programs. The ACA has been a political battleground since its inception, with Republicans previously attempting to repeal it. The current standoff centers on enhanced tax credits introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are set to expire at the end of the year. Both parties recognize the political implications of this issue, with some Republicans acknowledging the potential negative impact of letting the credits lapse.
