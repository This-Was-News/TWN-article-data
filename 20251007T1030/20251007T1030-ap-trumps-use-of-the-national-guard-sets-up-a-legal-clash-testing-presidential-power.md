## Article summary
President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard domestically, over local opposition, is sparking legal conflicts with Democratic governors and raising constitutional questions. Trump envisions a robust role for the military in addressing illegal immigration and crime, leading to deployments in states like Oregon and Illinois. This move challenges traditional boundaries of presidential power and federalism, with lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states questioning its legality. Trump's use of the National Guard has been criticized as authoritarian, with concerns about the potential misuse of force against Americans. The Posse Comitatus Act limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement, but Trump has hinted at invoking the Insurrection Act if necessary. Governors like Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker have sued, while the Pentagon struggles to confirm troop deployments. Legal experts warn that Trump's actions could undermine democratic norms and the rule of law, with courts set to decide on the constitutionality of his orders.
