## Article summary
On the second anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israelis and Palestinians marked the occasion with a mix of mourning, anticipation, and skepticism as indirect talks between Israel and Hamas continued in Egypt. Thousands gathered in southern Israel to commemorate the victims, while in Gaza, residents fled or sheltered in place ahead of another Israeli invasion. The talks in Sharm el-Sheikh aimed to finalize the first phase of a U.S.-proposed peace plan, including a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Despite progress, key disagreements remained, particularly over Hamas' disarmament and the future governance of Gaza. Meanwhile, protests and statements from world leaders highlighted the ongoing tensions and the humanitarian crisis in the region.
