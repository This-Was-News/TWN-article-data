## Article summary
Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee amid concerns about the Justice Department's politicization under her leadership. This comes after the department indicted former FBI Director James Comey, following public demands from President Trump. Comey faces charges related to his 2020 congressional testimony. Critics argue that the department has been weaponized, with significant turnover in key divisions and the firing of prosecutors handling cases involving Trump. Bondi has promised to end the 'two-tier system of justice' and investigate perceived adversaries. Trump has openly directed Bondi to target political opponents, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Senator Adam Schiff. The department's independence has been questioned, with career prosecutors expressing concerns about the strength of cases. Bondi has defended the indictments, stating that no one is above the law. Nearly 300 former DOJ employees have criticized the department's direction, calling for a return to upholding the rule of law.
