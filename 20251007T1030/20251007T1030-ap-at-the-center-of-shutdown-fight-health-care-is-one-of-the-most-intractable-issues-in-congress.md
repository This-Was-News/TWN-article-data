## Article summary
Democrats are pushing for an extension of health care subsidies to reopen the U.S. government, but Republicans are divided on the issue. Some Republicans support extending the subsidies, which were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, while others oppose them and see the debate as an opportunity to cut back on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, signed into law 15 years ago, has seen a record number of enrollees due to subsidies making plans more affordable. The government shutdown has entered its seventh day, with federal workers going unpaid. President Trump has said he is willing to work with Democrats on health care but insists the government must reopen first. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated Republicans are open to extending subsidies with reforms but refuses to negotiate until the government is reopened. Some GOP senators argue for overhauling the ACA, while Democrats believe public sentiment supports their stance. Private talks among senators aim to find a resolution, but disagreements persist, leaving the government shutdown unresolved.
