## Article summary
Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is currently on furlough due to the government shutdown. She has been vocal about the negative impacts of the shutdown, including program cuts and potential layoffs. Norton has urged lawmakers to assert their constitutional authority and reject spending deals that maintain the status quo. She believes the situation inside the government is worse than most Americans realize and sees her role as an opportunity to highlight the destruction of public services. Norton's work focuses on health disparities, particularly the higher rates of kidney disease among Black communities. The Trump administration has canceled numerous NIH grants, citing terms like 'structural racism,' which a judge initially ruled as unlawful before the Supreme Court intervened. Norton fears retaliation for speaking out but feels obligated to raise awareness about the administration's actions. She wears bracelets symbolizing her commitment to the Constitution and her support for federal agencies. Norton hopes for a future where her children can grow up in a world with free speech and democratic values.
