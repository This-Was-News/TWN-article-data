## Article summary
Israel marked the second anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks in a subdued manner, with peace talks ongoing but 48 Israeli hostages still in Gaza and over 67,000 Palestinians dead. The war, which began with a devastating Hamas attack, has led to significant destruction in Gaza and a high civilian death toll. The conflict has deeply divided Israeli society, with criticism directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for prolonging the war. The war has also exacerbated tensions with the ultra-Orthodox community and fueled global antisemitism. Israel's conduct in the war has drawn widespread allegations of genocide, which Israel denies. The conflict has increased Israel's isolation internationally, with several countries recognizing Palestinian statehood. Despite these developments, Palestinian political aspirations seem more distant than ever. The war shows no signs of ending, with ongoing military operations on both sides of the Israel-Gaza border.
