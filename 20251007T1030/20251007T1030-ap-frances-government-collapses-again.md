## Article summary
French President Emmanuel Macron faces significant political challenges following the abrupt resignation of his prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, marking the fourth prime minister in over a year. The resignation highlights Macron's diminishing control over France's political agenda and the difficulty in governing with a hung Parliament. Lecornu's resignation was due to the inability to build consensus on the budget, signaling that France may be becoming ungovernable. Macron's centrist camp has struggled to form stable alliances in the National Assembly, which is divided into three main blocs. Political opponents, particularly from the far left and far right, have consistently opposed Macron's governments, leading to repeated resignations. Macron has given Lecornu 48 hours to seek a resolution, but dissolving the parliament again could risk further political instability and potential far-right dominance. Macron's unpopularity and the risk of a crushing defeat for his centrist camp add to the political turmoil. Despite the domestic chaos, Macron remains focused on international issues, including wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and security threats from Russia. The political deadlock and instability weaken Macron domestically but do not necessarily limit his influence on the world stage.
