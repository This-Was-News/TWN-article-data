## Article summary
Dr. Tsion Firew, chair of emergency medicine in Rwanda, faced a Marburg virus outbreak, a deadly cousin to Ebola. She sent her children away for safety and worked tirelessly to combat the virus. The outbreak, which started with a miner infected by a bat, had a lower death rate than usual, with only 15 of 66 patients dying. Firew experienced fear, exhaustion, and hallucinations but remained committed to her work. She implemented experimental treatments, including remdesivir and monoclonal antibodies, which helped save lives. Despite the challenges, Firew's efforts and the Rwandan government's swift response were crucial in controlling the outbreak. She reflects on the importance of science and public health, hoping the world can learn from Rwanda's success. Firew's journey highlights her resilience and dedication to her family and community.
