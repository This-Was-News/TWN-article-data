## Article summary
Somali community care providers in Minnesota have donated over $138,000 to Somali politicians, predominantly Democrats, since 2020. This influx of campaign cash comes amid widespread allegations of fraud in Minnesota's autism, child care, and elder assistance sectors, with potential losses reaching billions of dollars. State Senator Omar Fateh and other Somali legislators have been major recipients of these funds. Some donors, like Abdi Daisane, have faced scrutiny for their businesses' compliance issues. Federal prosecutors estimate the fraud could cost taxpayers up to $9 billion, leading the Trump administration to freeze federal child care payments to Minnesota. State Senator Omar Fateh received approximately $11,000 from individuals implicated in the "Feeding Our Future" fraud scandal, which involved defrauding nutrition programs. He later redirected these contributions to food assistance charities. Representative Ilhan Omar also accepted funds from those involved in the scandal, subsequently donating them to community organizations. Governor Tim Walz has also received thousands from donors linked to Somali-operated care centers, some of whom have faced past fraud allegations. The situation highlights a complex intersection of community support, political fundraising, and allegations of significant government fraud.
