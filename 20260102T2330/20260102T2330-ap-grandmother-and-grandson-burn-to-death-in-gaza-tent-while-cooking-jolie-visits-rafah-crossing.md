## Article summary
A grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson tragically died in Gaza when their tent caught fire while they were cooking. This incident highlights the dire humanitarian crisis and harrowing winter conditions faced by thousands of Palestinians in makeshift housing. Angelina Jolie visited the Rafah border crossing to advocate for sustained humanitarian aid and a ceasefire. The crossing's reopening remains contentious, with Israel demanding the return of hostages before allowing Palestinians to exit. Meanwhile, Arab and Muslim foreign ministers expressed concern over Gaza's humanitarian situation, citing insufficient access to supplies. The conflict has resulted in a significant Palestinian death toll, with recent Israeli military operations in Gaza and the West Bank leading to further casualties and arrests. Aid groups report that not enough shelter materials are entering Gaza, exacerbating the challenges posed by the cold and wet weather. The lack of fuel and firewood makes it difficult for displaced individuals to stay warm. Israel disputes claims that it is not meeting the ceasefire stipulation for aid delivery, citing Hamas's alleged siphoning of supplies. The ongoing situation underscores the urgent need for increased humanitarian access and a lasting resolution to the conflict.
