## Article summary
California is facing scrutiny for fraud and financial waste, with Governor Gavin Newsom attempting to counter the narrative. The state's budget deficit has ballooned to an estimated $18 billion, exacerbated by spending on healthcare for undocumented immigrants and the high-speed rail project. Despite Newsom's team denying widespread scandal, critics point to the high-speed rail's cost overruns and delayed completion as evidence of mismanagement. An audit of the state's homelessness spending revealed a lack of oversight and accountability. The article argues that California's government is characterized by excessive spending, bureaucratic bloat, and a pattern of increasing taxes on residents to cover budget shortfalls. The high-speed rail project, in particular, is highlighted as a case of "union giveaways" rather than a functional transportation initiative. The state's financial situation is described as precarious, with a history of deficits despite a high tax burden. The article concludes that California's spending is rife with fraud and abuse, a reality acknowledged even by Newsom's administration.
