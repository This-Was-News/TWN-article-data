## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced a pause on immigration applications from an additional 20 countries, a move that took effect on January 1st. This expansion brings the total number of restricted countries to 39, plus the Palestinian Authority. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will halt the review of all pending applications for visas, green cards, citizenship, and asylum from immigrants in these newly added nations. The agency also plans to re-examine applications submitted as far back as 2021. The list of affected countries is primarily composed of nations in Africa, including Angola, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. USCIS stated the rationale behind these measures is to prevent individuals from high-risk countries, particularly those with high overstay rates or significant fraud, from posing risks to national security or public safety. Exceptions to the pause include athletes participating in the World Cup and Olympics. This action follows an earlier announcement by the Trump administration to expand travel restrictions. The DHS began implementing these enhanced reviews toward the end of 2025, coinciding with a decision to re-review the status of all refugees admitted under the Biden administration. Additionally, USCIS had previously implemented an indefinite pause on all asylum application processing to address its existing backlog.
