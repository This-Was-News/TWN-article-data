## Article summary
The debate over taxpayer-funded child care facilities in Ohio has intensified following State Rep. Josh Williams' call for an investigation into alleged fraud. Williams claims that publicly funded child care programs are billing the state for children who do not attend, with a particular focus on Columbus-area facilities. Governor Mike DeWine has defended Ohio's existing fraud prevention procedures, which differ from those in other states like Minnesota, where millions in taxpayer dollars were allegedly stolen and sent to a terror group. Ohio received over $800 million in federal funds for child care services in fiscal year 2024. Conservative social media accounts have linked dozens of Columbus-area day care centers to inactive shell companies, though DeWine stated some claims are inaccurate. Ohio pays child care facilities based on attendance, not enrollment, and verifies this through personal identification numbers with photo confirmation or QR codes. The state also utilizes cross-department data reviews and encourages public tips regarding suspected fraud. DeWine highlighted an instance where a social media tip about a tobacco shop at a daycare address was disproven by the fact that the Google Maps image was outdated and the facility had opened more recently.
