## Article summary
Representative Ro Khanna of California has expressed concerns regarding the delayed release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. He stated that the Justice Department should have begun preparing these files for public release months ago, following the introduction of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. While acknowledging the missed deadline, Khanna indicated that his primary concern is not the delay itself, but rather the specific documents the DOJ is currently withholding. He emphasized the importance of releasing survivor statements to the FBI that name individuals involved in abuse or cover-ups, as well as draft prosecution memos that explain the reasons behind the limited number of indictments. Khanna, along with Representative Thomas Massie, co-authored the transparency act, which was signed into law by President Trump. He discussed these issues in an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, highlighting the significance of a complete release for ensuring transparency and outlining potential congressional actions to expedite the process.
