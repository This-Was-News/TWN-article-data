## Article summary
President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of wind energy, asserting that wind turbines are responsible for the deaths of millions of birds, including bald eagles. Trump shared posts on Truth Social featuring images of bald eagles and flocks of birds near wind turbines, accompanied by claims of mass bird fatalities. He also referenced a Fox News story about the administration fining the wind energy company Orsted for allegedly killing bald eagles. This is not the first time Trump has attacked the wind industry, previously labeling wind turbines as ugly and inefficient. However, one image he used to illustrate bird deaths near turbines actually depicted a falcon that died in Israel in 2017. Under his administration, the wind industry has faced increased regulatory hurdles and the cancellation of over $679 million in offshore wind project funding. Recently, the administration paused five under-construction offshore wind projects along the East Coast, citing national security concerns related to the turbines' visibility. This pause has led to Democratic lawmakers halting discussions with Republicans on accelerating energy project reviews, as they were hesitant to support permitting reform legislation due to Trump's actions against renewable energy.
