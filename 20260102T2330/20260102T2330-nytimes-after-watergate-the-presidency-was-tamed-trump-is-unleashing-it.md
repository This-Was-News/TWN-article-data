## Article summary
The Watergate scandal led to significant reforms aimed at curbing presidential power and restoring public trust in government. These reforms included establishing ethical safeguards, protecting federal workers from political pressure, and restricting the president's unilateral war-making abilities. The Justice Department and FBI also worked to shed their roles as political tools. However, the article argues that Donald Trump has systematically dismantled these post-Watergate guardrails. Trump fired inspectors general, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, and the director of the Office of Government Ethics, agencies created to ensure accountability and prevent conflicts of interest. He has also used the Justice Department and FBI as political instruments, mirroring some of the abuses seen during the Nixon administration. Critics argue that Trump's actions represent a "perversion of justice" and a "legal abandon" that undermines the integrity of government institutions. While some legal theories support expansive presidential authority, experts warn that Trump's approach goes beyond constitutional arguments, enabling him to punish opponents and reward allies while potentially profiting his own businesses. The article concludes by questioning whether Trump will be remembered as a president who strengthened the office or as one who abused its power, akin to Nixon.
