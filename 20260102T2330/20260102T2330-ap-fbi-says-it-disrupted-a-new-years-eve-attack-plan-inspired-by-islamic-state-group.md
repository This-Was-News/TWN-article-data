## Article summary
The FBI announced the disruption of a New Year's Eve attack plot targeting a grocery store and fast-food restaurant in North Carolina, leading to the arrest of 18-year-old Christian Sturdivant. Authorities allege Sturdivant pledged loyalty to the Islamic State group and shared his plans to attack shoppers with an undercover FBI employee. Investigators found a manifesto detailing his intentions to use knives and hammers, and a note listing specific targets and a desire to die by police hands. The FBI had Sturdivant under surveillance and was prepared to arrest him earlier if he had left his home with weapons. Sturdivant was arrested on Wednesday and appeared in federal court on Friday, facing charges of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. This alleged plot occurred a year after a deadly attack in New Orleans by an individual who also expressed support for the Islamic State group. The FBI's investigation began after identifying Sturdivant's social media activity, which included content supportive of IS and references to its former leader. Sturdivant had previously been on the FBI's radar in 2022 as a minor after contact with a suspected IS member and receiving instructions for attacks, though no charges were filed at that time. The FBI also recently disrupted a separate New Year's Eve plot in Southern California involving an extremist anti-capitalist group. Sturdivant faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
