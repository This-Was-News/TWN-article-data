## Article summary
In the second year of the Trump administration, Congress is grappling with how to reassert its power after largely deferring to the president in the previous year. President Trump has demonstrated a pattern of acting with scant regard for Congress, unilaterally changing laws, withholding funds, claiming tariff powers, and launching military actions without legislative authorization. With midterm elections approaching and constituents concerned about economic issues, lawmakers face a choice: reclaim congressional authority or accept a diminished role. Some Republicans, like Representative Don Bacon, believe pushing back would lead to better policy, but acknowledge that the president may not feel constrained if his party acts as "lackeys." Despite bipartisan objections to some of the administration's actions, pushback from Capitol Hill has been largely ineffective due to Republican control of both chambers and a lack of robust oversight. Scholars note that Congress's traditional operating methods struggle to keep pace with a president who can act expeditiously. The president has ignored laws, such as the TikTok ban, and undermined agencies, while continuing military strikes without approval and undertaking large construction projects without congressional input. White House officials maintain that the president has acted within his legal authority, and Republican leaders in Congress highlight successes like extending tax cuts. However, the president has largely dismissed Congress's role in lawmaking and federal spending, with the Office of Management and Budget acting as a primary arbiter. Democrats, like Senator Michael Bennet, argue that Trump has "walked all over Congress," citing actions such as vetoing a water project bill and threatening funding for congressionally approved projects. Some in the House are exploring options like discharge petitions to bypass leadership and pursue legislation independent of the president's agenda, while Senate Republicans have resisted some of Trump's demands. Democrats see the courts and upcoming elections as the most effective means to challenge a president they accuse of having "utter contempt for the law."
