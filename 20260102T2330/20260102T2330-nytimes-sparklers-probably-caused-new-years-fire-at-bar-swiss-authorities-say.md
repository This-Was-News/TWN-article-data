## Article summary
A devastating New Year's fire at the Constellation bar in the Swiss resort town of Crans-Montana has claimed the lives of 40 people and critically injured dozens more. Authorities believe the blaze, one of Switzerland's deadliest conflagrations, was likely ignited by "feux de Bengale," small fireworks that produce a shower of sparks, which ignited the bar's ceiling insulation. The fire spread with extreme rapidity, trapping many young revelers, some as young as 15, inside the crowded basement bar. Survivors described a horrific scene of intense heat, flames, and a lack of oxygen, with some emerging with severe burns and disfigurement. Investigators are examining the bar's construction materials, safety measures, and emergency exits to understand how the disaster unfolded, with a focus on potential negligence. Families are desperately searching for missing loved ones, facing agonizing uncertainty as authorities work to identify the deceased through extensive forensic efforts. The bar, known as a casual and affordable nightspot, did not charge an entrance fee, contributing to its popularity with younger patrons. Eyewitnesses reported hearing an explosion, likely a flashover, as hot gases ignited. The owner claims the bar had passed multiple inspections, but investigations into criminal liability are ongoing. The incident highlights the dangers of seemingly harmless pyrotechnics in enclosed, combustible environments.
