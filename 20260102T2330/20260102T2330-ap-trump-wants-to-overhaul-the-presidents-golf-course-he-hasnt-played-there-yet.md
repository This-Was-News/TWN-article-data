## Article summary
President Donald Trump, despite preferring his own golf courses, has enlisted golf champion Jack Nicklaus to design a major overhaul for the Courses at Andrews, a military golf course near Washington D.C. This course, known as the president's golf course, has been frequented by numerous past presidents, with Barack Obama playing it most often. Trump has toured the base with Nicklaus and expressed his view that the course has been "destroyed" by a lack of maintenance, though others describe it as being in good condition. The planned renovation is expected to be the most significant in the course's history, potentially including a multifunctional event center. The cost and funding for the project are yet to be determined, with Trump suggesting it will require minimal funds. This endeavor is part of a larger pattern of Trump's construction projects, both within and outside the White House. The White House states that the improvements will benefit service members and their families for generations. Former general manager Michael Thomas shared anecdotes about presidents enjoying their time on the course, noting their particular enjoyment of driving golf carts. The article also touches on presidential perks at Andrews, such as blocking off holes for security and consistent play, and recalls Obama cutting short a round for a crucial national security decision. The Trump administration recently ended a lease agreement for three public golf courses in Washington, which the White House claims is unrelated to the Andrews project.
