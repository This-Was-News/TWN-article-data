## Article summary
President Donald Trump vetoed the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, a bill intended to provide a 100-year, no-interest repayment plan for Colorado communities funding a water pipeline. The bill, which had bipartisan support in Congress, was blocked by Trump who cited concerns about protecting taxpayer money from funding special interests and restoring fiscal sanity. U.S. Representative Lauren Boebert, who introduced the bill, expressed anger and disbelief at the veto, questioning the "America First" rationale and suggesting potential political retaliation. The Arkansas Valley Conduit project, authorized in 1962, aims to supply water to 50,000 people across 39 Colorado communities and has faced significant delays due to repayment challenges. Previous legislation in 2009 extended the repayment period and reduced the financial burden on local users, but construction only began in 2023 after state-level support. Despite the veto, the project is expected to proceed, with municipalities remaining on the existing 75-year repayment schedule with interest. Trump argued that the project, estimated to cost over $1.3 billion, is economically unviable and that federal taxpayers should not bear excessive costs for a local infrastructure project. Congress has the ability to override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate.
