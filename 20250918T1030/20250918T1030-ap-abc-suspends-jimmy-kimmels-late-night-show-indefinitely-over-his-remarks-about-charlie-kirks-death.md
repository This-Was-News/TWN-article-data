## Article summary
ABC has indefinitely suspended Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show following controversial remarks he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The suspension comes after several ABC-affiliated stations, led by Nexstar Communications Group, refused to air the show, citing Kimmel's comments as offensive and insensitive. Kimmel had suggested that Kirk's alleged killer might have been a pro-Trump Republican, which sparked backlash from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who called the comments sick and misleading. The FCC is considering holding Kimmel, ABC, and Disney accountable for spreading misinformation. The suspension risks further political repercussions, as President Trump has celebrated the move and threatened to retaliate against any reinstatement of Kimmel. Both Disney and Nexstar have pending FCC business, adding to the stakes of the situation. The suspension has drawn criticism from free speech advocates, who warn against government pressure on media outlets. Kimmel's show was canceled just as audience members were about to enter the theater, with Kimmel himself departing the studio shortly after. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to police speech about Kirk's death and exert influence over media coverage.
