## Article summary
The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has sparked divisive online discourse, with some officials suggesting foreign governments are exacerbating the situation. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox warned about foreign bots spreading misinformation and encouraging violence. However, experts like Darren Linvill from Clemson University argue that the toxic discourse is primarily home-grown, with foreign influencers and state-run media discussing the shooting but failing to significantly impact American audiences. For instance, a video by Irish journalist Chay Bowes, who works for Russia's state-run RT, garnered only 46,000 views, while a conservative influencer's video on the same topic received over 780,000 views. Linvill noted that foreign influence campaigns struggle to gain traction on major stories dominating social media. Despite this, state-run media in Russia, China, and Iran have mentioned Kirk's assassination over 6,000 times, each giving the story a unique spin. Russian media blames Ukraine, Iran points to Israel, and Chinese media uses the story to criticize the U.S. While these messages are intended for domestic audiences, experts warn that the U.S. is less equipped to detect foreign disinformation due to the dismantling of key government groups tasked with countering such influence since President Trump took office. This leaves the U.S. vulnerable to foreign malign influence.
