## Article summary
Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company due to a dispute with its parent company, Unilever. In his resignation letter, Greenfield accused Unilever of silencing Ben & Jerry's progressive voice on social issues. The company has long been known for its activism alongside its ice cream business. Greenfield and co-founder Ben Cohen have frequently clashed with Unilever over the company's independence and ability to take public stances on political and social matters. Ben & Jerry's sued Unilever earlier this year, alleging retaliation for the company's activism. Unilever's Magnum Ice Cream division expressed gratitude for Greenfield's contributions but disagreed with his perspective. The tension arises from an unusual merger agreement that grants the Ben & Jerry's board control over social messaging. The co-founders have been advocating for Unilever to sell the company through the 'Free Ben & Jerry's' campaign. Magnum is set to separate from Unilever in November, but the co-founders argue that the companies are no longer aligned. Cohen described the relationship as 'on the rocks' and called for Ben & Jerry's to find a socially-aligned owner.
