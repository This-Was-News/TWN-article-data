## Article summary
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a mutual defense pact, framing any attack on either nation as an attack on both, following Israel's recent strike on Qatar. This agreement, signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, aims to strengthen defense cooperation and joint deterrence. The pact comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, particularly after Israel's military offensive since Hamas' attack on October 7, 2023. Analysts suggest the timing is a signal to Israel, which is suspected of being the region's only nuclear-armed state. The agreement does not explicitly mention nuclear weapons, but a senior Saudi official hinted that Pakistan's nuclear protection is part of the deal. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have had long-standing defense ties, with Pakistan historically defending Saudi Arabia's Islamic holy sites. Pakistan developed its nuclear program to counter India's atomic bombs, and both countries have significant nuclear arsenals. India has expressed concern over the pact's implications for regional stability. The agreement also comes as Saudi Arabia seeks U.S. assistance for its civilian nuclear program, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has maintained a détente with Iran, mediated by China, and has condemned Israel's actions in Gaza.
