## Article summary
A tip led investigators to examine Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos's vacation photos on Instagram, revealing their stay on luxury yachts owned by billionaires. The Visual Investigations team used clues from a video and photographs to identify the yachts, including the Phoenix 2, owned by Turkish billionaire Ercument Bayegan. The team confirmed the locations and timelines using ship-tracking websites and background details in the photos. They found that the Trump-Boulos family moved between the Phoenix 2 and another yacht, the Magna Grecia, owned by Greek billionaire Ioannis Papalekas. The investigation also revealed that the family spent time at a private estate on St. Marguerite Island, owned by Papalekas's company. The findings raised concerns about the Trump family's associations with foreign business leaders involved in U.S. foreign policy.
