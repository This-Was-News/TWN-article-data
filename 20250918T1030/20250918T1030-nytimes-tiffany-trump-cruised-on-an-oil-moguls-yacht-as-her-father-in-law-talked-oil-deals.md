## Article summary
Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, vacationed on a luxury yacht owned by billionaire oil traders Ercument and Ruya Bayegan while Massad Boulos, Michael's father and Tiffany's father-in-law, negotiated oil deals in Libya. Massad Boulos, a senior Africa adviser for the State Department and a Trump family member, faced criticism for blending diplomatic and family interests. His actions, including unorthodox diplomacy and potential conflicts of interest, raised concerns among U.S. officials and allies. Despite praise for brokering a peace accord between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Boulos's tenure has been marked by controversies and diplomatic missteps. The family's yacht trip, involving high-profile figures and potential business interests, further blurred the lines between personal and governmental affairs.
