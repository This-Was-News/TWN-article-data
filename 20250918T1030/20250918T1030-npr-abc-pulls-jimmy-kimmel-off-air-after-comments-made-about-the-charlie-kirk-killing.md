## Article summary
ABC has pulled *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* off the air indefinitely following backlash over comments Jimmy Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During his monologue, Kimmel criticized President Trump's response to Kirk's killing and suggested that the shooter was part of the 'MAGA gang,' which sparked outrage. The Federal Communications Commission chairman threatened federal action against ABC affiliates carrying the show. Major TV station operators like Nexstar and Sinclair have also taken action, with Sinclair demanding an apology and donation from Kimmel. Supporters, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and free speech organizations, have denounced the suspension as censorship. The Writers Guild of America has opposed the move, emphasizing the importance of free speech and dissent.
