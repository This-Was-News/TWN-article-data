## Article summary
Former Vice President Kamala Harris reveals in her new book, '107 Days,' that she initially considered Pete Buttigieg as her 2024 running mate but ultimately deemed the pairing too risky for America. Harris writes that Buttigieg would have been an ideal partner if she were a straight white man, but the combination of a woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man, and Buttigieg was seen as too much for the country to accept. Despite her admiration for Buttigieg and his husband, Harris decided against the choice, acknowledging mutual sadness. The book excerpt, published in The Atlantic, comes as potential 2028 contenders begin campaigning. Harris eventually chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate after his attack line against Donald Trump and JD Vance gained traction, but they ultimately lost the election. The book, set to be published by Simon & Schuster, reflects on her brief presidential campaign.
