## Article summary
A New York Times investigation revealed that Michael Boulos, the husband of Tiffany Trump, and his family benefited financially from their proximity to the Trump family after their engagement in 2021. Boulos, working for his cousins yacht brokerage, sold Jared Kushner an overpriced superyacht, concealing the true cost and overcharging him by $2.5 million. Boulos received $300,000 from the deal. Additionally, Boulos cousin promised a Saudi businessman access to the Trump family at their wedding in exchange for $100,000, which Boulos received. Both deals ultimately failed, but Boulos and his family gained financially. The Trump administration's blending of family, business, and government is mirrored in the Boulos family's activities. Massad Boulos, Michael's father, became a Trump advisor and was portrayed as a billionaire, despite limited evidence of personal wealth. Michael Boulos is also pursuing business opportunities in Africa, leveraging his family's political connections. Associates of the Boulos family are also seeking business opportunities, using their proximity to power. Despite denials of wrongdoing, the deals highlight the blurred lines between personal relationships and financial gain in the Trump administration.
