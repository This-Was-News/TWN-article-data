## Article summary
A shooting in North Codorus Township, York County, Pennsylvania, has resulted in the deaths of three law enforcement officers and injuries to two others. The incident occurred during a follow-up investigation on a domestic-related case that began the previous day. Five officers were shot on Wednesday afternoon, with the two injured officers currently in critical but stable condition. The gunman was fatally shot by police, and there is no ongoing threat. Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Colonel Christopher Paris provided initial details but deferred further information to the York district attorney. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro expressed grief and called for societal improvement to prevent such violence. The U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi offered federal support, and local FBI is involved in the investigation. The incident affected the Spring Grove Area school district, which issued and later lifted a shelter-in-place order. York County, with a population of over 456,000, is located west of Philadelphia and north of Baltimore.
