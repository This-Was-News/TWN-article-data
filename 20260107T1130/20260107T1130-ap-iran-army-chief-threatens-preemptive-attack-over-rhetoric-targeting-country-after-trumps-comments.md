## Article summary
Iran's army chief, Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami, has threatened preemptive military action in response to rhetoric targeting the country, potentially referencing U.S. President Donald Trump's warnings. This statement comes as Iran faces a dual threat from Israel and the United States, alongside growing internal protests fueled by economic hardship. The Iranian government has implemented a new subsidy of approximately $7 per month for essential goods, but shopkeepers anticipate significant price increases due to the collapsing rial and the end of preferential exchange rates. These protests, which began on December 28th, reflect deep-seated anger over government repression and policies leading to international isolation. Hatami, who took command after a recent conflict, stated that Iran's armed forces are more prepared than ever and will retaliate decisively against any aggressor. Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been reacting to Trump's comments, particularly after the U.S. operation in Venezuela. The protests have spread across numerous locations in Iran, with reports indicating dozens of deaths, including civilians and security forces. The vice president described the situation as a "full-fledged economic war," calling for internal reforms. The ongoing demonstrations highlight the severe economic challenges and public discontent within the country.
