## Article summary
Pro-Trump influencers are celebrating a perceived victory after Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced he would not seek re-election, a move they attribute to a viral video alleging widespread fraud at Somali-run daycare centers. The video, posted by YouTuber Nick Shirley, has garnered millions of views and was amplified by Vice President JD Vance. Following the video's release, the Trump administration announced a freeze on $10 billion in federal funding to five Democratic-led states and deployed federal agents to Minnesota for an immigration crackdown. Influencers like Rogan O'Handley and Shirley himself have claimed responsibility for Walz's decision. Experts suggest this demonstrates a symbiotic relationship where online content creators can influence policy by highlighting issues that align with the administration's existing goals, such as defunding social programs in blue states. This dynamic is facilitated by Trump's cabinet, which includes individuals familiar with the attention economy of online content. While legitimate fraud cases exist, the rapid spread of unsubstantiated claims from influencers makes fact-checking difficult and allows them to shape public opinion before verification. Some childcare providers featured in Shirley's video have faced threats and vandalism, despite state officials finding children present at most of the facilities investigated. The Trump administration continues to use such claims to justify policy actions, with influencers like Benny Johnson now investigating alleged fraud in California.
