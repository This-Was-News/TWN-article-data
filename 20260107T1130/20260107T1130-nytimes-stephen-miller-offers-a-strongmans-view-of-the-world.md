## Article summary
Stephen Miller, a key figure in the Trump administration, has shifted his focus from hard-right domestic policies to aggressive foreign policy ambitions, particularly concerning Venezuela and Greenland. Miller embodies President Trump's "strongman" approach to international relations, believing that power and force govern the world. This philosophy is evident in the administration's consideration of military action to annex Greenland, a move that has drawn criticism even from within the Republican party. Miller's past, marked by controversial stances and a deep-seated belief in "100 percent Americanism," foreshadowed his current influence. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated Trump intends to buy Greenland, the White House has not ruled out military force. Miller's wife has also shown support for the administration's expansionist views. The administration maintains that Greenland should be part of the United States, a position that has strained relations with NATO ally Denmark. Miller's unwavering loyalty and execution of Trump's agenda, whether on immigration, trade, or territorial ambitions, underscore his significant role in shaping the administration's policies.
