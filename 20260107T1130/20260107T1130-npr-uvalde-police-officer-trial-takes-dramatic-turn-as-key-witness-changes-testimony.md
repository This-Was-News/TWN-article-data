## Article summary
The trial of Adrian Gonzales, a former Uvalde school district police officer charged with child endangerment in the Robb Elementary shooting, took a dramatic turn when a key witness altered her testimony. Stephanie Hale, a former teacher, stated she saw the gunman on the south side of the campus, the same area where Gonzales was positioned. This testimony contradicted her previous statements to a Texas Ranger, leading to defense objections and a halt in proceedings. The jury was dismissed, and the defense has raised the possibility of a mistrial. Gonzales faces 29 counts of abandoning or endangering a child, with prosecutors alleging he failed to confront the shooter despite being one of the first officers on the scene. The prosecution argued Gonzales had a duty to engage, while the defense contended he acted based on the information available to him. The altered testimony has caused distress to victims' families, who are anxious for justice. Criminologists estimate the chance of conviction at around 50 percent, noting the difficulty in predicting the case's outcome. Multiple reviews have found the overall law enforcement response to the shooting to be a failure, with nearly 400 officers present but taking over an hour to confront the gunman. Gonzales and former Uvalde CISD police chief Pete Arredondo are the only officers criminally charged, with Arredondo awaiting a separate trial.
