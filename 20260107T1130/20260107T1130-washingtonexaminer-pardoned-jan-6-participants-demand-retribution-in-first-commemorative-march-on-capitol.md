## Article summary
The fifth anniversary of the January 6th event saw a stark reversal from previous years, with pardoned participants marching on the Capitol, celebrating their release and demanding "retribution." Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, a prominent figure, defined retribution as "accountability" against those who "weaponized the government." Many attendees expressed gratitude to former President Donald Trump, believing he helped them regain their lives. The march featured various demands for retribution, including the prosecution of the officer who shot Ashli Babbitt, the firing of judges who sentenced Jan. 6 defendants, and a belief that the 2020 election was stolen. Some participants also sought financial reparations. The event was disrupted by activist Patricia Eguino, who protested the marchers, leading to confrontations and her brief detention by police. The gathering also saw instances of confusion regarding symbols, with some participants unaware of the meaning behind signs like WWG1WGA. Several Jan. 6 defendants, like Brian Betancur, have had their lives return to normal after receiving pardons. Robert Morss, a former defendant, found new opportunities and met his fiancée through Jan. 6 related events. Counterprotesters were also present, expressing strong opposition to the Jan. 6 participants and the MAGA movement, viewing their stance as crucial for the nation's well-being.
