## Article summary
Russia and China view President Trump's revival of the Monroe Doctrine, exemplified by the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, as a sign of the decline of the rules-based world order. Both nations, which have vested interests in Venezuela, criticize the U.S. action as a violation of international law and norms. Russia has provided significant military and economic aid to Venezuela, gaining a foothold in South America and challenging U.S. interests. China, a major purchaser of Venezuelan oil, also condemns the U.S. move, seeing it as a disruption to their economic ties and a potential precursor to further U.S. interventionism. While China criticizes the U.S. action, analysts suggest it will not accelerate their timeline for annexing Taiwan but will reinforce their belief in power over principle. The U.S. policy, while focusing on the Western Hemisphere, does not ignore other regions, with Trump also threatening intervention in Iran if the regime uses violence against protesters. The capture of Maduro highlights the geopolitical tensions and differing perspectives on international law and regional dominance among global powers.
