## Article summary
Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon has issued a warning to New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani's administration regarding anti-white discrimination. This warning follows the appointment of Cea Weaver as tenant advocate, who has previously expressed radical views on property ownership. In unearthed videos and social media posts, Weaver suggested a transition from viewing property as an individual good to a collective one, stating that white families would need to adopt a different relationship with property. She also equated property ownership with white supremacy in a 2019 post. Dhillon stated on X that the Department of Justice's Civil Rights division is paying close attention and will not tolerate discrimination based on skin color, emphasizing that such actions are illegal. In an interview, Dhillon reiterated that discrimination against white people is still discrimination and will not be tolerated, asserting that all citizens have equal rights. She warned the administration that they are under high scrutiny and that federal intervention will occur if necessary to protect citizens and residents of New York.
