## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is urging Venezuelans in the U.S. to return home, despite ongoing fears about the stability of the Maduro regime. This push comes after the Trump administration ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 600,000 Venezuelans last year, citing improved conditions in Venezuela. However, many Venezuelans, like Sebastian, a 28-year-old architect, express disbelief, pointing to the U.S. government's recent actions to remove President Maduro as evidence that the situation remains dangerous. The State Department advises U.S. citizens against travel to Venezuela due to risks including wrongful detention and torture. Reports of journalists being detained and armed groups suppressing dissent further fuel these concerns. Luis Falcón, who fled Venezuela due to persecution, believes returning now would lead to imprisonment, torture, or death. He argues that TPS should be reinstated until a stable government is in place. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Venezuela is more free than before and that TPS holders can apply for refugee status, a claim immigration attorneys dispute, noting that refugee applications must be filed from outside the U.S. While asylum is an option, recent pauses on asylum decisions present challenges. The situation is described as frightening yet potentially hopeful, with a desire for democracy and peace in Venezuela.
