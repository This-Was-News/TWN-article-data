## Article summary
President Trump announced that Venezuela would begin sending oil to the United States, a significant development following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro by American forces. This move, if confirmed, would involve the transfer of 30 to 50 million barrels of oil, valued between $1.8 and $3 billion, with Trump stating he would control the profits for the benefit of both nations. China has criticized this claim as "bullying," while Russia is reportedly escorting an oil tanker that defied U.S. blockades on Venezuelan energy exports. The U.S. is also pressuring Venezuela's interim government to expel advisers from China, Russia, Cuba, and Iran. Meanwhile, Venezuela has issued an emergency order that appears to criminalize support for the U.S. attack and militarize key industries. The potential influx of Venezuelan oil, despite its heavy crude nature, could impact global markets and benefit U.S. refineries equipped to process it, potentially lowering prices at the pump. However, the decree's enforcement and its impact on U.S. oil company interests remain uncertain. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing pursuit of oil tankers reflagging themselves as Russian vessels to evade U.S. sanctions.
