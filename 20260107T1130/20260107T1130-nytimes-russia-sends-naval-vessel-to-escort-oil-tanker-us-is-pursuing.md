## Article summary
Russia has dispatched a naval vessel to escort an oil tanker, previously known as the Bella 1 and now the Marinera, which the U.S. military has been pursuing for weeks. The U.S. initially stopped the tanker in the Caribbean on December 21st, citing a seizure warrant because it lacked a valid national flag. The tanker, which began its journey in Iran and was en route to Venezuela, refused to be boarded and sailed into the Atlantic with the U.S. in pursuit. In response, the tanker's crew painted a Russian flag on its hull, renamed the vessel, and added it to an official Russian ship database. Russia also lodged a formal diplomatic protest against the U.S. chase. Despite these actions, a video showed the U.S. Coast Guard vessel trailing the tanker in foggy weather. This tanker is part of a "shadow fleet" used to transport oil for Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, often in violation of U.S. sanctions. The U.S. has intensified its efforts against these tankers since President Trump ordered a blockade on oil shipments to and from Venezuela. The situation highlights increasing friction between the U.S. and Russia, particularly concerning U.S. actions against Venezuela. In recent weeks, at least three other oil tankers operating in Venezuelan waters have similarly switched to Russian flags, following a pattern of reflagging by ships under U.S. sanctions.
