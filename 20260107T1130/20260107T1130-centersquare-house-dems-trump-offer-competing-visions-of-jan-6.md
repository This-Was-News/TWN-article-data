## Article summary
On the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol storming, Democratic lawmakers and the Trump administration presented contrasting viewpoints. House Democrats, led by Rep. Bennie Thompson, questioned individuals connected to the events, including former Capitol Police officer Winston Pingeon, who criticized President Trump's pardons for those involved in the attack. Rep. Jamie Raskin echoed this sentiment, calling the pardons indiscriminate. Pam Hemphill, a Jan. 6 participant who declined a pardon, stated that accepting it would mean lying about the events. In response, the Trump administration launched a website detailing Jan. 6 events and defending the pardons, characterizing many participants as peaceful protestors unfairly labeled as insurrectionists by a "weaponized" DOJ. The administration also accused former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of misusing taxpayer funds to blame Trump and claimed Democrats staged an "insurrection" by certifying a "fraud-ridden" election. Mary McCord, a witness for the House Democrats, identified misinformation about the 2020 election results as the root cause of the violence, warning against false narratives that suppress voting rights and public protest.
