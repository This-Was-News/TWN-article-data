## Article summary
California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis is actively opposing President Trump's initiative to expand offshore oil drilling along the California Coast. She has formally communicated this opposition through a letter to the U.S. Department of the Interior, urging the removal of California from the federal plan. Kounalakis emphasized that the environmental and community costs of such drilling are excessively high, stating a firm rejection of these efforts. Assemblymember Dawn Addis echoed these concerns, citing potential restarts of oil drilling operations by Sable Offshore Corp. and highlighting the threat to existing industries and public health. Both officials pointed to historical environmental disasters like the 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill and the 2015 Refugio Spill as evidence of the severe consequences. Kounalakis's letter also noted that coastal industries, including agriculture, tourism, and clean technology, generate over $80 billion in revenue, which is at risk. The opposition comes in the wake of the federal government's auction of oil and gas drilling rights in the Gulf of America, signaling a broader push for increased domestic energy production. This move by California officials aims to protect the state's valuable coastal resources and economy from the detrimental impacts of expanded offshore drilling.
