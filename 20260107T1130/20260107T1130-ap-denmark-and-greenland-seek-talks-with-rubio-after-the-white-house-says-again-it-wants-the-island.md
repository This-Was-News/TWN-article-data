## Article summary
Denmark and Greenland are seeking a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio following renewed expressions of interest from the Trump administration in acquiring the Arctic island. The White House has stated that military action is a potential option for securing Greenland, which is a Danish territory. This assertion has been met with strong rejection from European leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Denmark and Greenland. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that a U.S. takeover would signal the end of the NATO military alliance. Leaders from several European nations have issued a joint statement affirming Greenland's sovereignty and its right to self-determination. President Trump has previously advocated for acquiring Greenland, citing its strategic importance in the Arctic and the need to counter threats from China and Russia. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Greenland's counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt have formally requested a meeting with Rubio, as previous attempts were unsuccessful. U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Thom Tillis have also criticized Trump's rhetoric, emphasizing the importance of respecting NATO allies' sovereignty. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot reported that Rubio dismissed the idea of a Venezuela-style operation in Greenland, highlighting the U.S. commitment to NATO principles.
