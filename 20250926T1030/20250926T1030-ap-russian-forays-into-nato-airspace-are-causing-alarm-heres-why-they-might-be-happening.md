## Article summary
Russian incursions into NATO airspace have reached unprecedented levels, raising concerns about the Kremlin's intentions. These violations, often denied or dismissed by Russia, have escalated since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with recent incidents involving drones and fighter jets in Poland, Estonia, Romania, and Latvia. The most significant breach occurred in Poland, where NATO jets shot down Russian drones, marking the first direct military engagement between the alliance and Russia since the Ukraine war began. Experts suggest these incursions may be aimed at testing NATO's resolve, exploiting potential weaknesses, or diverting attention and resources from Ukraine. Russia's actions could also be a coercive strategy to discourage NATO from supporting Ukraine robustly. The recent events have prompted NATO to bolster its air defenses and hold discussions, with some members advocating for a firm response. However, the alliance's unified stance remains uncertain, as responses from key members like the U.S. have been mixed. The situation underscores the delicate balance between deterrence and escalation in NATO-Russia relations.
