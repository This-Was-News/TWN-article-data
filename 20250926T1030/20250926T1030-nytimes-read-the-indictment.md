## Article summary
The document is an indictment filed in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, against James B. Comey Jr. on September 25, 2025. The indictment consists of two counts: one for making false statements to the legislative branch and another for obstructing a Congressional proceeding. Count One alleges that on September 30, 2020, Comey falsely stated to a U.S. Senator during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that he had not authorized anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about an investigation concerning PERSON 1. In reality, Comey had authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source. Count Two alleges that Comey obstructed a Congressional proceeding by making false and misleading statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The indictment concludes with a statement that the bill is true, signed by the foreperson and the United States Attorney, Lindsey Halligan.
