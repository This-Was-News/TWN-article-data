## Article summary
A 29-year-old gunman, identified as Joshua Jahn, carried out a deadly attack on a Dallas ICE facility on Wednesday, allegedly aiming to terrorize ICE employees. Jahn acted alone and extensively planned the attack, according to authorities. He fired at the ICE building and a van, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others before taking his own life. Investigators found notes from Jahn expressing hatred towards ICE employees and detailing his attack plan. The rifle used in the attack was legally purchased. Since the shooting, security at ICE facilities nationwide has been increased. This attack is the third incident targeting ICE facilities in the region since July. Jahn had no prior record of violent crime, though he had a minor drug conviction in 2016. Investigators are still processing evidence from the scene and Jahn's home. The attack appears to be motivated by a desire to disrupt ICE operations and instill fear among its employees.
