## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced new import taxes starting October 1, 2025, including 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture, and 25% on heavy trucks. These tariffs aim to reduce the budget deficit and boost domestic manufacturing, though their legal justification remains unclear. The tariffs could increase consumer prices and dampen hiring, adding to economic uncertainty. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that higher goods prices are contributing to inflation. Trump has pressured Powell to cut interest rates more aggressively, but Fed officials remain cautious due to tariff-related uncertainty. The pharmaceutical tariffs exempt companies building U.S. manufacturing plants, but the immediate doubling of drug prices could strain healthcare costs. Trump's earlier statements suggested a phased tariff approach, but the sudden announcement has shocked many. Major pharmaceutical companies have already announced U.S. production investments due to earlier tariff threats. The new tariffs on cabinetry and heavy trucks could further increase costs for homebuilders and domestic truck manufacturers. Despite Trump's claims of economic success, data shows job cuts in manufacturing and construction, and inflation remains a concern. Trump acknowledged that his tariffs against China have hurt American farmers and promised to divert tariff revenues to support them.
