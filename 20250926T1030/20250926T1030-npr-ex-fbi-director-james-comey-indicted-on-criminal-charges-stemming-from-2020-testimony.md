## Article summary
Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on criminal charges, including making false statements and obstruction of justice, related to his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The charges were brought after President Trump pushed for a faster investigation into one of his critics. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized that the indictment underscores the Justice Department's commitment to holding powerful individuals accountable. The move follows the replacement of the top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia with one of Trump's former defense attorneys. The indictment is the latest development in a long-standing feud between Trump and Comey, who has previously compared Trump to a mob boss. Earlier this year, the Secret Service investigated Comey after he posted a photo of seashells shaped like the numbers '86 47,' which some interpreted as an assassination threat. Comey served as deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush and began his career as a federal prosecutor in Virginia. Additionally, Comey's daughter, Maurene, was fired from her position as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan and has since sued the Justice Department, alleging wrongful termination due to her father's political speech and her perceived political beliefs.
