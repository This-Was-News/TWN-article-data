## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced new import taxes on various goods, including 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets, 30% on furniture, and 25% on heavy trucks, starting October 1. Trump believes these tariffs will reduce the budget deficit and boost domestic manufacturing, though he did not provide a legal justification. The tariffs are part of a broader strategy to address national security concerns and economic uncertainty. However, economists warn that these taxes could increase consumer prices and dampen hiring. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has cautioned about rising inflation due to higher goods prices. Trump has pressured Powell to cut interest rates more aggressively, but Fed officials remain cautious due to tariff-related uncertainty. The pharmaceutical tariffs will not apply to companies building U.S. manufacturing plants, but the sudden announcement has raised concerns about potential price hikes and healthcare costs. Homebuilders may also face increased costs due to the cabinetry tariffs, while heavy truck manufacturers will be protected from foreign competition. Despite Trump's claims of economic success, data shows job cuts in manufacturing and construction sectors, and inflation remains a concern. Trump also acknowledged the impact of his tariffs on American farmers and promised to divert tariff revenues to support them.
