## Article summary
Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted for allegedly lying to Congress and obstructing a criminal proceeding. He denied the charges and called for a trial. The indictment stems from Comey's 2020 Senate testimony about an investigation. President Donald Trump, who fired Comey in 2017, celebrated the news, calling Comey bad for the country. Comey has been a vocal critic of Trump, describing him as unethical and untethered to truth in his 2018 memoir. Trump and his supporters have long targeted Comey, with recent tensions rising over a social media post by Comey that some interpreted as a call for violence. Comey's daughter, Maurene, a former federal prosecutor, is suing the Justice Department after being fired, alleging her dismissal was connected to Trump's hostility toward her father. Meanwhile, Comey's son-in-law, Troy Edwards, resigned as a federal prosecutor shortly after Comey's indictment.
