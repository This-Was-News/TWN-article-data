## Article summary
Hollywood is divided over the Israel film boycott, with two opposing open letters from prominent figures. Over 5,000 actors and filmmakers, including Pedro Pascal, Javier Bardem, and Selena Gomez, signed a letter on September 9 pledging to boycott Israeli film groups, accusing them of being involved in genocide and apartheid against Palestinians. In response, more than 1,200 Hollywood figures, such as Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik, and Sharon Osbourne, signed a counter-letter rejecting the boycott. They argue that the boycott is misinformed, discriminatory, and antisemitic, and that it erases dissenting Israeli voices and shields Hamas from blame. The counter-letter urges the industry to reject the boycott and calls for the release of hostages and standing against Hamas. The original letter was published by Filmmakers for Palestine, while the counter-letter was published by Creative Community For Peace and The Brigade. Filmmakers for Palestine dismissed the counter-letter as anti-Palestinian racism. The counter-letter includes influential figures like Shari Redstone, Ynon Kreiz, and David Kohan. Paramount Studios also responded, condemning the boycott and advocating for engagement and communication in the global entertainment industry.
