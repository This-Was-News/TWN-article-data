## Article summary
A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James B. Comey on charges of making a false statement and obstructing a congressional proceeding, following intense pressure from President Trump. The indictment, filed in Alexandria, Virginia, stems from Comey's 2020 Senate testimony regarding an investigation into Hillary Clinton. Despite objections from career prosecutors, who found insufficient evidence, Trump loyalist Lindsey Halligan, recently appointed by the president, overruled them. The indictment is seen as a significant step in Trump's campaign to retaliate against perceived enemies. Comey has declared his innocence and welcomed a trial to clear his name. The case has raised concerns about political interference in the Justice Department and the erosion of public trust. Meanwhile, Trump has praised the indictment, continuing his public demands for prosecutions of his adversaries. The investigation into Comey is one of several opened by the Trump administration, with other probes focusing on classified documents related to the Russia inquiry. The indictment has led to resignations within the Justice Department and sparked warnings about the misuse of the justice system for political purposes.
