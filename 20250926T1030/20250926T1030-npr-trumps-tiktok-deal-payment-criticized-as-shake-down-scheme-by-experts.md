## Article summary
President Donald Trump's administration has been criticized for extracting payments from businesses, including a multibillion-dollar fee from U.S. investors acquiring TikTok's operations. The investors, including Larry Ellison and the Murdochs, agreed to the payment, seen as a 'finders' fee.' This practice is part of a broader pattern where the Trump administration seeks financial benefits from major business transactions, such as equity stakes and profit shares. Critics argue this undermines innovation and fosters rent-seeking behavior. Trump has defended these actions, citing benefits for America. Media companies have also faced pressure, with settlements and regulatory approvals following Trump's interventions. Business leaders express private concerns but publicly support the deals, fearing retaliation. The TikTok deal, involving Oracle and ByteDance, includes data hosting and algorithm licensing, with a surprise fee request. Overall, the administration's actions are seen as crony capitalism, raising concerns about fairness and market principles.
