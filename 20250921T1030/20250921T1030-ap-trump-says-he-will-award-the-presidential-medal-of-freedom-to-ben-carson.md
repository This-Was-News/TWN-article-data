## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will award Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon and Housing and Urban Development secretary, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Trump made the announcement during an event at Mount Vernon for the American Cornerstone Institute, which Carson founded. Carson, once a rival during the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, has since become a close ally and served as Trump's national faith chairman during the last election cycle. Known for his staunch conservative views, Carson has become a popular speaker and author. The Medal of Freedom, established in 1963, recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to the United States or world peace. Trump has previously awarded the medal to 24 people during his first term and has recently announced awards to Rudy Giuliani and Charlie Kirk. Giuliani, a longtime political ally, was seriously injured in a car crash, while Kirk, a conservative activist, was assassinated earlier this month. Trump plans to attend Kirk's memorial service in Arizona on Sunday.
