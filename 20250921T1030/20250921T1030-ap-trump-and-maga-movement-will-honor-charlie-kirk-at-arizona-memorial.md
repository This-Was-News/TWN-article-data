## Article summary
President Donald Trump and prominent members of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement will honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a memorial service in Arizona. Kirk, credited by Trump for playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, was assassinated at a Utah college campus, sparking a debate about political violence and free speech. The memorial, expected to draw tens of thousands, will be held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, with tight security. Trump has blamed the 'radical left' for Kirk's death and criticized Democrats for not condemning the assassination. The event has led to job losses for those deemed offensive about Kirk's death, igniting a First Amendment debate. The State Department warned of visa revocations for foreigners celebrating Kirk's assassination. Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah man, has been charged with Kirk's murder. Kirk founded Turning Point, a multimillion-dollar organization mobilizing young Christian conservatives. Despite his controversial statements, Kirk had a massive influence in conservative America. The memorial will feature speeches from Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other prominent figures, along with performances by notable Christian musicians.
