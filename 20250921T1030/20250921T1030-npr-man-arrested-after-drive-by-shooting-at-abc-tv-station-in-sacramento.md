## Article summary
A man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, was arrested after a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 TV station in Sacramento, California. He faces felony charges including shooting into an occupied building and assault with a deadly weapon. The incident occurred on Friday afternoon when at least three bullets were fired into the station's lobby, but no injuries were reported. The shooting happened a day after protests outside the station over the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, though the connection is unclear. The station's owner, TEGNA, expressed gratitude that employees were unharmed and increased security. Journalists and organizations, including the National Association of Black Journalists Sacramento chapter, condemned the violence. Hernandezsantana was released on bail and is scheduled to appear in court on September 23.
