## Article summary
The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has sparked a deep divide in how Americans interpret the event, with social media exacerbating the schism. Vice President Vance blamed left-wing extremism, while Jimmy Kimmel suggested the shooter was part of the 'MAGA gang,' leading to Kimmel's suspension and debates over free speech. Social media, where over half of U.S. adults get news, has fragmented understanding of the event, with videos of the shooting spreading rapidly. Experts note that social media rewards extreme content, driving engagement but lacking context. Influencers quickly shared theories, some linking the shooter to far-right or leftist groups, or video game culture. The arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who grew up in a conservative household but leaned left, revealed his motivations were personal, targeting Kirk for his anti-trans rhetoric. Despite claims of a larger movement, Robinson acted alone. The cryptic messages on the bullet cartridges were meant as an online meme. The charging document undermines both Vance's and Kimmel's narratives, showing no evidence of a wider extremist movement. Social media continues to fuel speculation and conspiracy theories, with users gravitating towards beliefs that align with their political leanings.
