## Article summary
Russian jets violated Estonian airspace for 12 minutes, ignoring signals from NATO's Italian pilots. The incursion, near Vaindloo Island, was the fourth this year, with Estonia confirming it via radar and visual contact. Russia denied the violation, but Estonian officials dismissed the claim, suggesting it could be a tactic to divert Western resources from Ukraine. The Russian MiG-31 fighters, tracked by Finnish and Italian jets, posed no military threat but ignored communications. Estonia plans to request NATO consultations under Article 4, while Lithuania's defense minister cited Turkey's 2015 response as an example. Czech President Petr Pavel advocated for a strong NATO response, including potentially shooting down Russian jets. Estonia ruled out invoking Article 5, despite repeated violations and allegations of a Russian hybrid war against the West. Russia's Defense Ministry maintained its jets stayed in neutral waters, but Estonia and NATO allies confirmed the airspace breach. Estonian officials suspect Russia aims to distract from Ukraine by provoking NATO into reinforcing Estonia's defense.
