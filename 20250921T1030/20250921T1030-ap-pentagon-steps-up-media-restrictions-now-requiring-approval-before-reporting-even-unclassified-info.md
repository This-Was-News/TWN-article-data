## Article summary
The Pentagon has introduced stricter media restrictions, requiring credentialed journalists to sign a pledge not to report unclassified information without prior approval. Violations could result in the loss of Pentagon access. The new policy, outlined in a 17-page memo, has been criticized by press freedom advocates as an attack on independent journalism. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized that the press must follow rules or leave. The Pentagon has previously faced issues with leaks and unauthorized disclosures, leading to increased scrutiny and restrictions. Organizations like the National Press Club and the Society of Professional Journalists have condemned the policy as a violation of press freedom and a step toward government censorship. The Washington Post's executive editor also criticized the policy, stating it undermines the public's right to information about government activities.
