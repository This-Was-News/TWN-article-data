## Article summary
A corporate jet registered to retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle crashed while attempting to land at Statesville Regional Airport on Thursday morning, resulting in the deaths of all seven people on board. North Carolina State Highway Patrol confirmed Biffle was among the deceased, and U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson stated that Biffle, his wife Cristina, and their two children were killed in the crash. The Cessna Citation business jet was engulfed in flames upon the arrival of emergency crews. Flight records indicated the jet was registered to a company owned by Biffle. Governor Josh Stein expressed his heartbreak, remembering Biffle not only as a NASCAR champion but also for his humanitarian efforts following Hurricane Helene. Biffle had organized helicopter flights to deliver supplies and rescue victims in cut-off mountain towns after the hurricane. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has dispatched a team to investigate the crash. The airport remains closed while debris is cleared from the runway. Tributes have poured in from the NASCAR community and political figures, mourning the loss of Biffle and his family. The NTSB expects to hold a media briefing on Friday.
