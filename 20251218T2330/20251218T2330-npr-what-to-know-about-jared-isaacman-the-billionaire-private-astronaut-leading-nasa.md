## Article summary
Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut, has been confirmed as the new head of NASA by the Senate. This confirmation follows a turbulent year after his initial nomination by President Trump in December 2024. Isaacman, who has flown to space twice with SpaceX and was the first civilian to walk in space, brings no federal government experience to the role. His nomination was initially withdrawn by Trump in May due to concerns over "prior associations" and political donations, despite Isaacman describing himself as "relatively apolitical." Isaacman's vision for NASA, outlined in a leaked document called "Project Athena," emphasizes a business-like approach with reduced bureaucracy, more frequent astronaut missions, and increased industry partnerships. He has a background in e-commerce, founding Shift4 Payments as a teenager, and has funded and commanded private spaceflights, including the Polaris Dawn mission. Isaacman takes the helm at a critical time for NASA, which faces potential significant budget cuts, downsizing, and competitive pressures. He aims to lead NASA into a "bold new Era," focusing on lunar and Mars missions while also seeking to extract more value from space through commercial partnerships. His confirmation hearing was attended by supporters, including Bill Nye, CEO of The Planetary Society, who advocates for NASA's science programs. Isaacman's personal reflections on space emphasize its challenging nature and the need for hard work to establish a human presence in space.
