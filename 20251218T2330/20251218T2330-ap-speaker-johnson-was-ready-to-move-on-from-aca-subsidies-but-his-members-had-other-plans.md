## Article summary
Speaker Mike Johnson faced a revolt from the moderate wing of the Republican party regarding the extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. Despite Johnson's preference to move past the issue, four Republican members joined a Democratic discharge petition, forcing a House vote on extending the subsidies in January. This move by Democrats is seen as a vindication of their strategy to highlight the issue, especially with upcoming midterm elections. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded an immediate vote, but Johnson stated it would occur in January. The impasse leaves lawmakers in limbo as they head for the holiday break, with pressure mounting on Republican leaders to address concerns about rising insurance costs. While a bipartisan group of senators is discussing potential compromises, the Senate has previously rejected a three-year extension. The White House has been involved in discussions but has largely let House Republicans resolve their internal divisions. House Republicans recently passed a healthcare package focused on long-standing GOP priorities, but some members remain concerned about ACA costs. The holidays offer Johnson a chance to persuade moderates, and the discharge petition's success indicates broader support for a vote. Jeffries' strategy of holding firm on a three-year extension without income caps has paid off, forcing GOP moderates to consider his position. Democrats aim to use the "Republican healthcare crisis" as a campaign message. This division within the House GOP is a recurring theme due to the narrow majority, with Johnson acknowledging the challenges of leading such a conference. Some Republicans express discontent over not voting on a bipartisan extension, fearing it will be used against them in elections. Despite these internal disagreements, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise insists the Republican conference is united.
