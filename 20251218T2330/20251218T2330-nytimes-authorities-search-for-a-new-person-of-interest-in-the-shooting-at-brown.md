## Article summary
Authorities are searching for a new person of interest in connection with the Brown University shooting last Saturday, which resulted in the deaths of two students, MukhammadAziz Umurzokov and Ella Cook, and injuries to nine others. Investigators are also looking into a possible link between this incident and the killing of M.I.T. professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro earlier this week, as a rented car believed to be used by the Brown shooting suspect is the same make and model as one identified in connection with Dr. Loureiro's death. The gunman at Brown, described as masked and dressed in black, escaped the scene, and authorities have released grainy video clips of a figure in the neighborhood east of campus, though the suspect's face remains obscured. The victims, Cook and Umurzokov, are remembered as bright and dedicated students with promising futures. Meanwhile, Dr. Loureiro, a respected scientist and director of M.I.T.'s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was fatally shot at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, approximately 45 miles from Brown University. While initially skeptical, investigators are now exploring a potential connection between the two violent events, a development that has delayed a scheduled news conference. The manhunt for the Brown shooter is ongoing, with authorities urging public assistance due to the limited evidence left behind by the elusive gunman.
