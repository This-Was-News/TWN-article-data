## Article summary
Mariah Carey's iconic holiday song, "All I Want for Christmas Is You," has achieved a new milestone by breaking the all-time record for the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with a total of 20 weeks. This achievement follows its tie with Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road" and Shaboozey's "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" at 19 weeks. The song, originally released in 1994, first reached No. 1 in 2019 and has consistently topped the chart during the holiday season each year since. This success is partly attributed to the streaming era, which has revitalized classic holiday music and contributed to longer chart runs. Notably, Mariah Carey also holds the record for the longest-running No. 1 song prior to the streaming era with her Boyz II Men collaboration, "One Sweet Day," and has accumulated the most weeks at No. 1 of any artist in Billboard history. Meanwhile, Ariana Grande is experiencing a strong week with multiple albums charting on the Billboard 200 and her song "Santa Tell Me" returning to the Top 10 of the Hot 100. Additionally, the duo She & Him has made its first-ever entry onto the Hot 100 with their song "I Thought I Saw Your Face Today," driven by a popular TikTok trend. Despite a significant presence of holiday songs on the charts, this non-holiday entry from She & Him is considered noteworthy.
