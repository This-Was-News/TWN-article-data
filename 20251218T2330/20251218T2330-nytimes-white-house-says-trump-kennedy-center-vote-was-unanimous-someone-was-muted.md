## Article summary
The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts board of trustees has voted to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. This decision was announced following a meeting held at the Palm Beach home of Steve Wynn, whose wife, Andrea Wynn, is a board member. President Trump, who had previously referred to the center by this new name online, expressed his honor at the board's decision, though he claimed surprise. The board is now reportedly composed almost entirely of individuals loyal to Trump, with a few congressional members also serving. Representative Joyce Beatty, a Democrat, recounted being muted during the meeting when she voiced her opposition, and the renaming was subsequently declared unanimous. Legal experts and members of the Kennedy family have questioned the legality of the name change, asserting that the center is a federally designated memorial to President Kennedy and that such a change would require congressional approval. Kerry Kennedy and Joe Kennedy III have publicly denounced the renaming, with Joe Kennedy III comparing it to renaming the Lincoln Memorial. Andrea Wynn defended the decision, stating that President Kennedy was a great lover of the arts and that President Trump has also shown his love for the arts through his involvement. Steve Wynn, a longtime friend of President Trump, suggested the name reflects the men who have given the center its vitality. This renaming is seen as the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to assert its influence on various national landmarks and institutions.
