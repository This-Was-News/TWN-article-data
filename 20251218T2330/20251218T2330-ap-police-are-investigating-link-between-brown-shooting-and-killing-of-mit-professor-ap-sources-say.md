## Article summary
Police are investigating a potential link between a mass shooting at Brown University and the killing of an MIT professor, according to AP sources. The Brown University shooting, which occurred on a Saturday, resulted in two students killed and nine wounded. Two days later, MIT physics professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro was fatally shot at his home near Boston. Investigators have identified a person of interest in both incidents and are actively searching for this individual. The shooter at Brown managed to escape, and frustration is growing due to the lack of a clear image of the suspect. Authorities have released security footage showing a person of interest, but the individual's face is obscured. The investigation into the Brown shooting is ongoing, with authorities pleading for public assistance in reviewing footage. Past high-profile shootings show that shooters either commit suicide, are apprehended by police, or disappear, with the latter being rare. The suspect in the Brown shooting is described as about 5 feet 8 inches tall and stocky, with motives still unclear. MIT is mourning the loss of Professor Loureiro, who was a respected physicist and fusion scientist dedicated to advancing clean energy technology.
