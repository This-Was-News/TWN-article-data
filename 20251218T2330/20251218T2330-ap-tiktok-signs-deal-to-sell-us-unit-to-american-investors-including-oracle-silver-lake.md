## Article summary
TikTok has finalized an agreement to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, including tech giants Oracle and Silver Lake, as well as MGX. This deal, expected to close by January 22, aims to ensure the popular social video platform's continued operation in the United States. The new U.S. joint venture will be majority-owned by American investors, with a new seven-member American board of directors. Oracle will manage U.S. user data locally, and TikTok's algorithm will be retrained on U.S. data to prevent outside manipulation. This agreement resolves years of uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the U.S., following legislative threats of a ban if its ownership structure did not change. Previous attempts at a sale or spin-off faced significant hurdles, including China's objections to certain terms. The deal is designed to address U.S. national security concerns and protect American user data. ByteDance, TikTok's China-based parent company, will retain a 19.9% stake in the new U.S. venture. The agreement comes after a period of intense scrutiny and multiple executive orders aimed at resolving the situation.
