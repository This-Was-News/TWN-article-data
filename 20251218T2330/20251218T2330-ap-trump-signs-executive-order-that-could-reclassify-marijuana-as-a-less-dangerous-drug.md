## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that could reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, moving it from Schedule I to Schedule III. This significant policy shift aims to facilitate medical research and ease regulations, though it will not legalize recreational use. The move aligns with actions taken by many states, where medical marijuana is now legal in 40 states and Washington D.C. Trump stated the decision was driven by numerous calls from individuals in pain seeking relief. The reclassification could also reduce tax burdens on the cannabis industry. While the Biden administration had previously proposed a similar change, Trump's order accelerates the process. The order also promotes expanded research and access to CBD, with a pilot program offering it at no cost to older adults. However, the decision faces opposition from some Republicans who argue marijuana remains dangerous and could negatively impact safety and health. Critics also point to a potential contradiction with Trump's strong stance against other drugs like fentanyl. Pro-marijuana advocates, while supportive, desire further steps like decriminalization. The Food and Drug Administration has recognized scientific support for marijuana's use in treating specific conditions like anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and pain.
