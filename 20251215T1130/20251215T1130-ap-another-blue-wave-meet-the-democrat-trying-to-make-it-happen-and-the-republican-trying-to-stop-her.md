## Article summary
Republican Brian Jack, the top recruiter for his party's House campaign team, is working closely with President Donald Trump to identify and vet potential candidates for the 2026 midterm elections. Jack aims to leverage Trump's base and "Make America Great Again" agenda to overcome dissatisfaction with his leadership. Meanwhile, Democratic Congresswoman Lauren Underwood is leading recruitment efforts for her party, focusing on candidates with community involvement and public service experience, aiming to replicate the "blue wave" of 2018. Underwood emphasizes finding "ordinary Americans" who can contrast with "MAGA extremists." Trump's involvement in candidate recruitment is more direct than in 2018, with discussions in the Oval Office focusing on alignment with the White House. Democrats are employing a district-by-district strategy, seeking candidates who can connect their backgrounds to the role of a congressperson and withstand Republican attacks. The ongoing fight over gerrymandering, largely driven by Republicans at Trump's behest, has created uncertainty in the House district landscape, with both parties identifying competitive seats. Democrats are targeting several Republican-held seats, particularly those within a 15-percentage point margin in 2024, while Republicans are aiming to flip a smaller number of Democratic-held seats. The recruitment efforts for both parties highlight the deep partisan divisions and the strategic approaches being taken to gain or maintain control of the House.
