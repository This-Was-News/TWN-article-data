## Article summary
A father and son are suspected of killing 15 people during a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach, an event described by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as an act of antisemitic terrorism. The 50-year-old father, an Australian resident who arrived in 1998, was killed by police, while his 24-year-old Australian-born son was shot and wounded. Among the victims were a 10-year-old girl, a rabbi, and a Holocaust survivor. The father was a member of a gun club, and authorities are investigating the son's past ties to an Islamic State group cell. A bystander, Ahmed al Ahmed, was praised for tackling one of the gunmen. This attack occurred amidst a significant rise in antisemitic incidents in Australia, with attacks surging threefold after October 7, 2023. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel criticized Australia's government for not taking antisemitism seriously enough. The shooting is the deadliest in Australia in three decades, a country known for its strict gun control laws following a 1996 massacre. The government is proposing tougher gun laws in response to the incident.
