Rob Reiner, the acclaimed Hollywood director and actor, and his wife, Michele Reiner, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Sunday, prompting a homicide investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department. Mr. Reiner, 78, was a significant figure in film and television, known for directing classics like 'This Is Spinal Tap,' 'The Princess Bride,' and 'When Harry Met Sally…,' and for his role as Meathead on 'All in the Family.' He was also a prominent Democratic political activist, championing causes such as early childhood development and same-sex marriage. Michele Reiner, 70, was a photographer whose meeting with her husband on the set of 'When Harry Met Sally…' inspired him to change the film's ending. She also worked on some of his films and co-founded the 'I Am Your Child' campaign with him. Tributes poured in from prominent figures including former President Barack Obama, Gov. Gavin Newsom, and Mayor Karen Bass, who lauded their contributions to both the arts and civic life. The couple lived in the affluent Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, a community known for its celebrity residents. Police have cordoned off the area and are seeking a search warrant for the home, but have not identified a suspect or released details on the cause of death. The family has requested privacy during this difficult time.
