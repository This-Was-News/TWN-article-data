## Article summary
Chile has elected José Antonio Kast, a far-right politician, as its new president, marking a significant shift to the right. Kast's victory was propelled by widespread fears concerning crime, migration, and economic instability. He secured over 58% of the vote in the presidential runoff election. Kast, who has expressed admiration for Chile's former dictator Augusto Pinochet, pledged to restore peace, order, and hope to the nation. During his campaign, he focused heavily on public security and immigration, promising an "emergency" government. His message resonated with voters concerned about rising violent crime and undocumented migration. Kast's win signifies a departure from years of left-of-center rule in Chile. This outcome also reflects a broader trend in Latin America, where security and migration have become key electoral issues. Neighboring Argentina's far-right president, Javier Milei, congratulated Kast, viewing the win as a rejection of socialism in the region. The U.S. Secretary of State also extended congratulations, expressing anticipation for collaboration on regional security.
