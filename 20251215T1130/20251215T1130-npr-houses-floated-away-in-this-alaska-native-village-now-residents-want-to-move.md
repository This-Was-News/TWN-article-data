## Article summary
The Alaska Native village of Kwigillingok is grappling with the urgent need to relocate its residents to higher ground and further inland following severe damage from the remnants of Typhoon Halong. The storm caused nearly every house to be damaged, with some even floating away, displacing hundreds of people. Kwigillingok has long faced challenges from erosion, flooding, and thawing permafrost due to climate change, but this recent event has intensified the desire to move. Residents fear losing their language and cultural practices, such as subsistence hunting and fishing, if they remain displaced in larger cities. While the community is eager to relocate, state and federal officials are prioritizing rebuilding and conducting further studies on the complex issue of relocation, which has historically been costly and fraught with challenges in other communities. The Bureau of Indian Affairs' historical establishment of villages around schools in the mid-20th century is also cited as a factor in their current vulnerability. Despite the logistical and financial hurdles, the residents of Kwigillingok hope that the recent disaster will spur the necessary action and funding for their move, allowing them to preserve their culture and ensure their safety from future climate-related threats.
