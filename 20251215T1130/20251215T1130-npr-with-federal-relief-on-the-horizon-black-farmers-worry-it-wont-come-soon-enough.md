## Article summary
Black farmers are facing significant economic challenges due to retaliatory tariffs, making it difficult to cover operational costs despite having a good harvest year. James Davis, a third-generation farmer, highlighted that even with high yields of cotton, soybeans, and corn, the low prices make it nearly impossible to repay loans. The Trump administration announced a $12 billion aid package for farmers, but many, like Davis and PJ Haynie, chairman of the National Black Growers Council, believe the relief may not arrive soon enough to address immediate financial obligations. Haynie emphasized that one-time payments are insufficient to compensate for incurred losses. Compounding these issues, the administration also dismantled USDA programs crucial for Black farmers' access to credit and technical assistance. Historically, Black farmers have faced systemic discrimination, leading to a drastic reduction in Black-owned farmland over the past century. Experts predict continued financial strain for farmers due to tight margins and global market uncertainties, with countries like Brazil increasing their market share in soybean exports. Farmers like Finis Stribling III and John Lee II expressed concerns about securing loans for the upcoming year, viewing the $12 billion aid as a small gesture compared to the scale of their financial struggles. The National Black Growers Council is advocating for support to protect and grow their small community of farmers.
