## Article summary
A gunman remains at large after a shooting at Brown University that killed two students and injured nine others. Police initially held a man in his 20s as a person of interest but later released him, leaving authorities without a known suspect. The violence occurred inside an academic building during final exams, just days before the start of winter break. Seven of the nine injured students were in critical but stable condition, one was in critical condition, and one was treated and released. The university has canceled most remaining in-person exams to focus on supporting its community. Officials had previously released a description of the suspect as a male dressed in black and a short video of a person of interest, but the investigation has taken a new direction. The incident has caused shock and anxiety within the community, drawing messages of sympathy from state officials and President Trump.
