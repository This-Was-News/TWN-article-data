## Article summary
A mass shooting occurred at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach, resulting in the deaths of at least 15 people and hospitalizing at least 42 others. The attack, carried out by a father-and-son duo, targeted the "Chanukah by the Sea" event. The elder gunman was killed by police, while his son was wounded. Among the victims were a 10-year-old and an assistant rabbi. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the shooting as a "targeted attack against Jewish Australians" and a "terrorist incident." Two improvised explosive devices were found at the scene. Mass shootings are rare in Australia due to strict gun laws. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the attack on Australia's government, citing a perceived inaction against the spread of antisemitism. The incident has drawn international condemnation, with the UN chief calling it a "heinous deadly attack."
