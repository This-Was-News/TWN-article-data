## Article summary
Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy media mogul in Hong Kong and a vocal critic of Beijing, has been convicted in a significant national security trial. He was found guilty by three judges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security and of publishing seditious articles. Lai, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, faces a potential life sentence. He was arrested in 2020 following large-scale anti-government protests and has been in custody since, reportedly in solitary confinement with declining health. His trial, which lacked a jury, has been closely watched internationally as an indicator of media freedom and judicial independence in Hong Kong. Lai's family expressed sadness and condemnation, stating the verdict weaponizes the national security law against dissent. The court ruled Lai was the mastermind of conspiracies aimed at destabilizing the Chinese Communist Party. The conviction has drawn criticism from the U.S. and U.K., while China defends Hong Kong's legal system. Rights groups have slammed the verdict, asserting it undermines press freedom.
