## Article summary
Authorities have announced they will release a person of interest detained in connection with a shooting at Brown University that resulted in two student fatalities and nine injuries. Officials stated there is no basis to hold the individual any longer, leaving law enforcement without a current suspect. The investigation will now focus on canvassing for video surveillance to identify the perpetrators. The shooting occurred during final exams, leading to the cancellation of all remaining academic activities for the semester. Students described hiding under desks and turning off lights as the incident unfolded. Surveillance video shows a suspect dressed in black calmly walking away from the scene, with their identity not yet clear. Two handguns and loaded magazines were recovered when the person of interest was initially taken into custody. The community gathered to honor the victims, transforming a planned holiday lighting event into a vigil. The university president expressed admiration for the students' resilience and mutual support during the crisis. The investigation into the motive and the shooter's actions is ongoing.
