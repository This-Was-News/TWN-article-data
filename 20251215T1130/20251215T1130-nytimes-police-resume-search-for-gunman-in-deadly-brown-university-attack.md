## Article summary
Law enforcement officials in Providence, R.I., are urgently searching for a gunman who killed two people and injured nine others at Brown University on Saturday. The search was renewed after investigators released a person of interest because they lacked sufficient evidence to connect him to the shooting. The attack occurred in an engineering building during a review session for an economics class. A masked assailant with a rifle entered the lecture hall and opened fire, causing panic among the approximately 60 students present. Some students managed to escape, while others hid under desks and chairs. Seven of the nine injured students were reported to be in stable condition, with one remaining in critical condition. Campus exams have been canceled, and students are being encouraged to go home. Officials are appealing to the public for any video or photographic evidence that could aid the investigation, noting a lack of cameras in the building where the shooting took place. The incident has deeply shaken the tight-knit community of Providence and Brown University, with a candlelight vigil held for the victims. Mayor Brett Smiley emphasized the importance of providing verified information and empathy to help the community heal from the trauma. The investigation is ongoing, involving local, state, and federal agencies, as the community grapples with the fear and anxiety caused by the unresolved shooting.
