## Article summary
President Trump has extended the enforcement delay of a nationwide TikTok ban until mid-December, marking the fourth delay. TikTok is a dominant social media video app, with about one in three Americans using it and half of adult users relying on it for news. The app's Chinese ownership has raised concerns among U.S. politicians, leading to a bipartisan law in 2024 mandating a ban unless TikTok is transferred to a U.S.-owned entity. The ban took effect in January, but Trump initially paused enforcement for 90 days to allow negotiations. Recently, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a potential deal framework with China, with Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping expected to finalize it. Trump mentioned that a group of major companies is interested in acquiring TikTok as he departed for a state visit to the UK.
