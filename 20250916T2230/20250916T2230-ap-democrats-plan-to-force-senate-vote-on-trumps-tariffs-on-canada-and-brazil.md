## Article summary
Democrats plan to force Senate votes on President Trump's tariffs on Canada and Brazil, with Sen. Tim Kaine introducing bipartisan resolutions to terminate the national emergencies justifying these tariffs. Kaine aims to put Senate Republicans on record regarding their stance on the tariffs, which have drawn criticism from some Republicans. The votes are triggered by a decades-old law allowing Congress to block presidential emergency powers. Despite potential Senate passage, the House has temporarily blocked such efforts, making the Senate votes symbolic. The tariffs are contributing to economic turmoil, with the Congressional Budget Office predicting increased joblessness, inflation, and reduced growth. Republicans, while expressing concerns, largely defer to Trump on trade policy. The resolutions target tariffs on Canada for insufficient drug trafficking control and on Brazil due to policies affecting former President Jair Bolsonaro. Democrats hope more Republicans will oppose the tariffs as their economic impacts become evident, with Kaine emphasizing the shift from theoretical to real consequences.
