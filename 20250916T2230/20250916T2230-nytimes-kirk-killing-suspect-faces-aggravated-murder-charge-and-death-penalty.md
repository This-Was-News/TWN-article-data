## Article summary
Prosecutors in Utah have charged Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old man, with aggravated murder and other felonies in the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. Evidence includes Robinson's own text messages, where he admitted to the shooting, stating he had enough of Kirk's hatred and that some hate can't be negotiated out. Robinson's parents played a crucial role in his surrender after recognizing him in a news photo. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Robinson appeared in court via video, showing little emotion. The case has sparked political tensions, with some blaming left-wing networks, though authorities believe Robinson acted alone. The investigation involved thousands of tips and the discovery of a note Robinson left under a keyboard, detailing his plan to kill Kirk. The case highlights the divisive political climate and the rush to assign blame.
