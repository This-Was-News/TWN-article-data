## Article summary
Prosecutors revealed that Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, texted his partner expressing frustration with Kirk's hatred, stating that some hate cannot be negotiated. The text messages, presented in court documents, provide insight into Robinson's motive. Robinson was charged with aggravated murder and other crimes related to instructing his partner to delete incriminating messages. His mother reported that Robinson had become more politically left-leaning and supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. The texts showed Robinson admitting to the shooting and mentioning a note he left about taking out Kirk. Prosecutors noted phrases etched on ammunition, including anti-fascist and transphobic messages, which Robinson dismissed as a meme. Robinson had been planning the shooting for over a week and apologized to his partner for involving them. Authorities believe he acted alone, and his partner is cooperating with the police. The texts do not specify which of Kirk's views Robinson found hateful, and prosecutors have not confirmed if transgender issues played a role in the shooting.
