## Article summary
Robert Redford, known for his diverse roles as an actor and director, was also a master of the 'afternoon thriller'—films that blend tension, charm, and intrigue, perfect for a cozy viewing experience. His 1976 film 'All The President's Men,' based on the Watergate scandal, is considered one of the most influential journalism movies, focusing on the reporters' investigative journey rather than just the scandal itself. Another notable thriller, 'Three Days of the Condor' (1975), follows a CIA researcher who discovers a conspiracy within the agency, featuring a stellar cast including Faye Dunaway and Max von Sydow. 'Sneakers' (1992), a lighter but equally engaging thriller, showcases Redford leading a team of security testers in a cat-and-mouse game with the NSA, boasting an impressive ensemble cast. Redford's contributions to cinema extend beyond these thrillers, but they remain a significant part of his legacy, offering entertaining and thought-provoking viewing experiences.
