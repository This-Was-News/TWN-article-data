## Article summary
New York prosecutors attempted to charge Luigi Mangione with terrorism under a 9/11-era law for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, but a judge dismissed the terrorism charges, allowing only murder and other charges to stand. The judge ruled that the state anti-terror statute did not apply to the case. Mangione, who faces both state and federal murder charges, no longer faces state terrorism charges. The judge concluded that prosecutors did not establish the intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or influence government policy. The terrorism law, passed in 2001, was designed to combat terrorism and enhances penalties for certain crimes. Prosecutors argued that Mangione's actions were intended to sow terror within the health insurance industry, citing his writings and actions. However, the defense contended that Mangione's actions did not fit the state's definition of terrorism. The judge agreed, stating that the crime was not ordinary street crime but also not terrorism. The case highlights the challenges of applying terrorism laws to non-traditional terrorism scenarios. Similar cases have been brought and sometimes rejected in other instances where terrorism charges were deemed inappropriate.
