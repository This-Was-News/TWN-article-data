## Article summary
House Republicans are proposing a $30 million increase in security funding due to growing concerns about political violence, following the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This funding is part of a stopgap bill to fund the government before a September 29 deadline. House Administration Chair Bryan Steil briefed Republicans on existing safety resources, noting increased use of security programs by members. The funding would support a mutual aid program for local law enforcement assisting lawmakers. Recent incidents, including attacks on state lawmakers and assassination attempts on President Trump, have heightened fears. Kirk's assassination has sparked conversations about member safety, with lawmakers like Tom Suozzi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez adjusting their public appearances. A pilot program increasing security funding for lawmakers to $5,000 a month is set to expire, with calls for more support. The U.S. Capitol Police are handling thousands of threat assessment cases. House Democrats reviewed security programs, with Rep. Joe Morelle emphasizing the need for more funding to ensure member safety and democratic engagement.
