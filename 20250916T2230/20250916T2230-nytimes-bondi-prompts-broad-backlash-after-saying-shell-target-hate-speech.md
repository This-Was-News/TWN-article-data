## Article summary
Attorney General Pam Bondi sparked widespread criticism after stating she would target protesters engaging in hate speech and investigate businesses refusing to print memorial posters for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Her remarks, made on Monday, seemed to align with the Trump administration's efforts to punish those celebrating or criticizing Kirk's killing. However, the First Amendment's broad protections for free speech, which do not cover direct incitement to violence, raise questions about the legal basis for her actions. On Tuesday, Bondi clarified that hate speech crossing into threats of violence is not protected and is a crime. Conservative figures, including pundits, authors, and lawmakers, swiftly criticized her initial remarks, citing a May 2024 post by Kirk himself, which asserted that hate speech is not a constitutional concept. Brit Hume, a longtime Fox News host, highlighted that repulsive speech is still protected under the First Amendment. Bondi's comments were made on right-wing media outlets, following her expressions of outrage over Kirk's killing and support for his family.
