## Article summary
Prosecutors charged Tyler Robinson with the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, presenting evidence including a note and text messages where Robinson confessed to planning and carrying out the attack. Kirk was shot on September 10, 2025, while speaking at Utah Valley University. Robinson, 22, allegedly used a bolt-action rifle from a nearby building's roof. Prosecutors outlined Robinson's planning, including a note left for his partner and texts detailing his intentions. DNA on the rifle's trigger matched Robinson's. The motive remains unclear, but texts suggest Robinson had grown tired of Kirk's views. Robinson's family reported his recent political shifts and his relationship with a transgender partner. He was arrested near St. George, Utah, after his family persuaded him to turn himself in. Robinson faces charges including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, obstructing justice, and witness tampering. The FBI is investigating connections to a Discord chatroom. Kirk's assassination has sparked national debates about political violence and division.
