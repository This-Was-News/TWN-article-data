## Article summary
Tyler Robinson, accused of fatally shooting conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, has been charged with aggravated murder and other counts, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty. Authorities allege Robinson disposed of evidence, including the rifle used in the shooting, and obstructed justice by directing his roommate to delete incriminating messages. Surveillance footage suggests Robinson hid the rifle in his pants, and prosecutors claim he wrapped the gun in a towel and discarded it after the shooting. Robinson's mother reported his recent political shift towards leftist views, including support for gay and trans rights. The roommate, a transitioning male with whom Robinson was romantically involved, found a note under Robinson's keyboard stating his intent to kill Kirk. Robinson's next court date is set for September 29, and he is being held without bail. Speculation suggests Robinson was politically motivated, with Utah Gov. Spencer Cox noting his radicalization and deep involvement in online subcultures. Investigators found bullet casings with inscriptions referencing internet memes and anti-fascist themes. Kirk's funeral will be attended by President Trump, and his organization, Turning Point USA, will continue his tour. Kirk's death has sparked debates about his legacy and the impact of his divisive views.
