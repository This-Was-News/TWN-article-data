## Article summary
Israel launched a ground offensive in Gaza City on Tuesday, escalating the conflict with Hamas and pushing residents to flee south. The offensive follows months of diplomacy without a ceasefire, with Israeli media suggesting it could last for months. Heavy strikes in Gaza City resulted in at least 69 deaths, according to hospitals. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that without a two-state solution, peace in the Middle East is unlikely, and extremism will spread. He criticized Israel's actions, stating it appears determined to continue the conflict. Meanwhile, Egypt, a key mediator, referred to Israel as an enemy, marking a significant shift in rhetoric. The U.N. commission accused Israel of genocide, a claim Israel denies. The conflict has also drawn in other regions, with Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen firing missiles at Israel. The European Union and Britain condemned Israel's offensive, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages. Tens of thousands of Palestinians fled northern Gaza, with the U.N. estimating around 220,000 have left the area. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Qatar to discuss mediation efforts and the recent Israeli strike in Doha that killed Hamas members and a local official.
