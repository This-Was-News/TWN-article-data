## Article summary
ICE crackdowns have intensified in Boston, targeting immigrants in various public areas, including workplaces and courthouses, as part of President Trump's efforts against sanctuary cities. Unmarked ICE vehicles have been spotted in immigrant communities, leading to increased fear and canceled events like the Hispanic Heritage Month festival in Everett. While some officials praise the crackdown, advocates argue it is causing more harm than good, increasing fear among immigrant communities. Cities like Boston and Chicago have been targeted, with Mayor Brandon Johnson condemning the crackdown as tyranny. The DOJ sued Boston over its sanctuary city policies, which limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. ICE launched 'Patriot 2.0,' detaining nearly 1,500 immigrants in Massachusetts. Advocates report that ICE is targeting not just criminals but also noncriminals, leading to collateral arrests. Protests and hotlines have been set up to monitor ICE activity and support affected communities. Immigrants express fear over daily activities but continue to work to provide for their families. U.S. Attorney Leah Foley supports ICE's operations, while advocates argue that the crackdown is unfairly targeting individuals going through legal processes.
