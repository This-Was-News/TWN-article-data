## Article summary
A recent round of violence in Gaza has highlighted the fragility of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, with analysts predicting further tensions. The truce, now ten days old, faces significant challenges due to mutual accusations of violations. On Sunday, two Israeli soldiers were killed by a Palestinian missile, leading to Israeli retaliatory strikes that resulted in 44 Palestinian deaths. Despite the violence, U.S. officials and mediators are working to sustain the cease-fire and advance peace efforts. The situation remains volatile, with both sides having reasons to claim breaches of the truce. Hamas's control over its militants and the return of hostages are critical issues. Analysts expect continued clashes and challenges in implementing the Trump peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm. Some Palestinian analysts suggest Hamas might seek a dignified exit from power to preserve the cease-fire.
