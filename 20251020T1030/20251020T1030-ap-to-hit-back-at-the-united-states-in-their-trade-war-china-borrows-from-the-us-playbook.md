## Article summary
China has adopted U.S. trade practices to retaliate against American trade policies. By expanding export rules on rare earths, China now requires foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing Chinese-originated materials. This move mirrors the U.S. foreign direct product rule, which extends U.S. law to foreign-made products. China's actions are part of a broader strategy to counter U.S. trade measures, including the creation of an Unreliable Entity List and anti-foreign sanction laws. These tools allow China to restrict foreign companies and freeze assets, similar to U.S. practices. Beijing's approach reflects a learning from U.S. tactics, aiming to constrain American economic development and political choices. The trade war has led to reciprocal tariffs and export controls, with both sides deploying new tools to retaliate. Experts warn that this escalation could lead to a dangerous cycle of retaliation, with no clear winners.
