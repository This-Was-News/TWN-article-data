## Article summary
Israel identified the remains of two hostages, Ronen Engel and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, after Hamas handed them over to the Red Cross. The bodies were believed to have been killed during the October 7 attack. Israel threatened to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed until Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning all deceased hostages. Hamas has handed over 13 bodies, 12 of which have been identified as hostages. The Rafah crossing, the only one not controlled by Israel before the war, has been closed since May 2024. The Palestinian Authority announced procedures for Palestinians wishing to leave or enter Gaza through Rafah. Israel's war in Gaza has resulted in over 68,000 Palestinian deaths and thousands missing. Hamas and Israel have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Hamas began talks for the second phase of the ceasefire, which includes disarming Hamas and establishing an internationally backed authority to run Gaza. Hamas rejected U.S. claims of an imminent planned attack by Hamas against Gaza residents, accusing Israel of supporting armed groups in the region.
