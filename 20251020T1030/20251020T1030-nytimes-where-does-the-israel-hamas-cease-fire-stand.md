## Article summary
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, in place for over a week, faces instability due to unresolved issues and recent flare-ups of violence. Both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement. On Sunday, Israel launched significant attacks on Gaza, accusing Hamas of targeting and killing two soldiers, while Hamas denied involvement in the incident. Despite the tensions, both parties have expressed commitment to maintaining the truce. The cease-fire includes provisions for increased aid to Gaza, but Israel temporarily halted aid due to the intensity of its strikes. Hamas has released the remaining living Israeli hostages and the bodies of some captives, but the recovery of all remains is complicated by the destruction in Gaza. Israel is also supposed to return the bodies of Palestinians in exchange for Israeli hostages. The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt is set to reopen, but its status depends on Hamas's compliance with the agreement. Future negotiations will address complex issues such as Hamas's disarmament and the governance of Gaza.
