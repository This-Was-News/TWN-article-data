## Article summary
A daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris resulted in the theft of 'priceless' jewels, including the crown of Empress Eugénie. Four suspects broke into the Galerie d'Apollon through a second-floor window, using chainsaws and box cutters to smash display cases. They fled on scooters after a seven-minute operation, leaving behind some damaged jewelry. The thieves employed a basket lift mounted on a truck to access the window and attempted to destroy it as they escaped. French authorities described the operation as highly organized and have mobilized all central police units to track down the suspects. The Louvre was evacuated and closed to preserve evidence. The Galerie d'Apollon, which houses many of France's royal jewels, reopened in 2020 following renovations. This heist is part of a recent trend of robberies targeting French museums, including thefts from the National Museum of Natural History and the Adrien Dubouché National Museum.
