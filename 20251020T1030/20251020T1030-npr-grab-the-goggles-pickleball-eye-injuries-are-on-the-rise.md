## Article summary
Pickleball, a rapidly growing sport in the United States with nearly 20 million players, has seen a significant rise in eye injuries. A recent study in JAMA Ophthalmology reports an estimated 405 additional cases of pickleball-related eye injuries annually from 2021 to 2024. These injuries include lacerations, corneal abrasions, and inflamed irises, with 70% of cases occurring in adults aged 50 and older. The study highlights the need for standardized eye protection guidelines, which could reduce up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries. Experts note that the sport's fast-paced nature and small court size contribute to the risk. However, getting players to wear protective eyewear is challenging due to the variety of options and the additional cost. The study suggests that awareness campaigns, user-friendly eye protection, and examples set by professional athletes could help mitigate these injuries. Despite limitations in sample size and data collection, the primary goal is to raise awareness about the preventable nature of these injuries.
