## Article summary
Israel and Hamas accused each other of breaching a fragile ceasefire on Sunday, with Israel striking Gaza and Hamas denying involvement. Israel's military reported attacks on its troops in the Rafah area, leading to retaliatory strikes on Hamas targets. Hamas maintained its commitment to the ceasefire, while Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered strong action against terrorist targets. The violence included the deaths of two Israeli soldiers and a family of 11 in Gaza. The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S., involved the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Gaza's media office accused Israel of numerous ceasefire violations, and the conflict has resulted in significant casualties on both sides.
