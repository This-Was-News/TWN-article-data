## Article summary
The ongoing government shutdown has left U.S. Capitol Police officers working without pay, missing their first full paycheck on October 10th. These officers, who protect lawmakers daily, face increasing threats and violence, making their job increasingly challenging. Senator Katie Britt and Representative Joe Morelle have expressed concern for the officers, with Morelle criticizing the lack of negotiation and the impact on the officers' lives. The Trump administration has proposed repurposing funds to pay federal law enforcement, but Democrats have questioned the legality of this move. Additionally, officers feel disrespected by some GOP lawmakers' actions, such as not opposing pardons for January 6 rioters and the delayed installation of a memorial plaque honoring officers who defended the Capitol. Despite these challenges, the officers continue to perform their duties professionally, though their morale is being tested.
