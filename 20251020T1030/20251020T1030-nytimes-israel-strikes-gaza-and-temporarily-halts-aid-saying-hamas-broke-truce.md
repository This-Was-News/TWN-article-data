## Article summary
Israel launched a series of attacks on Gaza, accusing Hamas of violating a fragile cease-fire by attacking its soldiers, resulting in the deaths of two Israeli soldiers and 44 Palestinians. The Israeli military temporarily suspended humanitarian aid, which was expected to resume once the bombing stopped. Both sides have accused each other of breaching the truce, but they remain committed to maintaining it. The violence marks a significant test of the cease-fire, which was brokered by the Trump administration. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the violence and ordered a strong response. Hamas denied involvement in the initial incident but accused Israel of violating the truce. The cease-fire had aimed to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza, which has been severely affected by conflict and displacement. Members of Netanyahu's government called for a full resumption of the offensive against Hamas. The cease-fire deal included the exchange of hostages and prisoners between Israel and Hamas, with some bodies and captives still unaccounted for.
