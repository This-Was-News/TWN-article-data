## Article summary
Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator, won Bolivia's presidential election, securing 54% of the votes against right-wing rival Jorge Tuto Quiroga. Paz's victory was driven by voters frustrated with the country's economic crisis and the long rule of the Movement Toward Socialism party. Paz plans to implement significant economic changes, including ending the fixed exchange rate and phasing out fuel subsidies, while maintaining some social benefits. He aims to avoid a sharp recession and high inflation. Bolivia faces severe economic challenges, including a dollar shortage and high inflation. Paz's strategy involves fighting corruption, reducing wasteful spending, and restoring confidence in the country's currency. His running mate, Edman Lara, a popular former police captain, played a crucial role in the campaign, appealing to working-class and rural voters. Paz's party secured a slight majority in Congress, but he will need to compromise to push through his reforms. The election results highlight a divide between wealthier eastern regions, which supported Quiroga, and the western highlands and Cochabamba, which backed Paz. Paz's victory sets Bolivia on an uncertain path as he seeks to enact major changes for the first time since Evo Morales's election in 2005.
