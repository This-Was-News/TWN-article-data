## Article summary
The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has added five new members ahead of a crucial meeting in Atlanta. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed these members, replacing those from the Biden administration. The new members bring diverse public health experience and are expected to help restore public confidence in vaccines. The committee, now with 12 members, influences vaccine recommendations, including those for the Vaccines for Children program and insurance coverage. They will discuss policies such as who should receive the fall COVID-19 booster shot and whether all newborns should get the hepatitis B vaccine. The new members were selected from a list initially reported by the 'Inside Medicine' newsletter, with two others not being appointed. Dr. Raymond Pollak, a semi-retired transplant surgeon, expressed his qualifications and the value of having diverse representation on the committee. The new members join seven others appointed in June, replacing all previous members. The changes have led to concerns about the committee's expertise and the integrity of its advice, with some states reducing reliance on ACIP guidance.
