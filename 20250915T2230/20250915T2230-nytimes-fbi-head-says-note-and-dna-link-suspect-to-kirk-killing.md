## Article summary
FBI Director Kash Patel revealed in a TV interview that physical evidence, including DNA matching suspect Tyler Robinson, links him to the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk in Utah. A note written by Robinson before the shooting expressed his intent to kill Kirk, though it was later destroyed and reconstructed by authorities. DNA evidence was found on a towel wrapped around the rifle used in the shooting and on a screwdriver at the crime scene. Robinson turned himself in about 30 hours after the shooting, which occurred at Utah Valley University. The motive for the killing remains under investigation, with authorities examining Robinson's online presence and gathering information from his associates. Kirk, a right-wing activist, was shot while speaking to students, shocking the nation. The FBI continues to piece together the events leading up to the shooting, including the significance of the note and text messages.
