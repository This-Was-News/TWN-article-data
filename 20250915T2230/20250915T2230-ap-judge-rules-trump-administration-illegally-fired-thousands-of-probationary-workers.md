## Article summary
A judge ruled that the Trump administration's central human resources office acted illegally when it directed the mass firings of probationary workers as part of efforts to downsize the federal workforce. U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco stated that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) unlawfully exceeded its powers and usurped the authority of individual federal agencies to hire and fire their own workers. The judge's decision found that over 25,000 probationary workers were wrongfully terminated soon after Trump took office. Alsup had previously ordered the reinstatement of these workers, but the U.S. Supreme Court set that decision aside on a technical basis. The judge noted that workers were fired for poor performance, which the administration defined as not being mission-critical during cutbacks. In his ruling, Alsup stated that too much time had passed to reinstate the fired workers, but he ordered most agencies to update personnel files and send letters to workers stating they were not terminated for performance. Exempt agencies include the State Department and NASA. The terminated probationary employees have moved on to new jobs, and many agencies have undergone significant changes, making reinstatement impractical.
