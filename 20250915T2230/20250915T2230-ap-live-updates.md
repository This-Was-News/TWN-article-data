## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military struck a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing three people. This follows a previous strike two weeks earlier that killed 11 people. Trump stated that the military has seen fewer vessels in the Caribbean since the first strike but noted that cartels are still smuggling drugs by land. Meanwhile, activists in Chicago reported an uptick in immigration enforcement. Trump also discussed potential federal intervention in Chicago and Memphis, facing resistance from local officials. Additionally, Trump mentioned a possible deal regarding TikTok's ownership and praised its role in his 2024 election campaign. The U.S. is also dealing with the aftermath of the assassination of conservative activist Charles Kirk, with Vice President JD Vance hosting a tribute show in his honor. The Trump administration is seeking increased funding for security measures following the assassination. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated the U.S.'s stance against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the use of military force against drug cartels. The administration is also facing scrutiny over its handling of the Kirk investigation and other issues.
