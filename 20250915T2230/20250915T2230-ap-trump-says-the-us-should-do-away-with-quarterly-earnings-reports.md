## Article summary
President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating quarterly earnings reports, suggesting a switch to a six-month reporting period. He believes this change would save money and allow company managers to focus on running their businesses. The SEC has required quarterly reports since 1970. Supporters argue that quarterly reporting is costly, time-consuming, and discourages companies from going public, while also encouraging a focus on short-term targets over long-term planning. The Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) has also advocated for semiannual reporting, aiming to promote sustainable growth. Opponents of the change argue that quarterly reports provide valuable financial updates and help investors assess company risks. A 2024 report by David S. Koo highlights that frequent reporting offers context and perspective for investors. The original rationale for quarterly reporting in 1970 was to reduce information asymmetry, particularly during economic downturns.
