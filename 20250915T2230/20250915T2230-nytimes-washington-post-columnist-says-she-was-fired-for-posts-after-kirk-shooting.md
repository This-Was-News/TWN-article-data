## Article summary
Karen Attah, an opinion columnist for The Washington Post, claims she was fired last week for her social media posts about gun violence and racial double standards following the assassination of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk. Attah expressed her views on social media, criticizing inaction from white America regarding gun control and condemning political violence. She stated that The Washington Post deemed her posts unacceptable and a form of gross misconduct, allegations she denies. The Washington Post's policies emphasize responsible and civil use of social media. The newspaper's opinion section has undergone changes recently, with a shift towards embracing personal liberties and free markets, leading to the departure of several staff members, including former opinion editor David Shpley. Other workplaces have also terminated employees for public remarks about Kirk's assassination. Attah maintained that she did not celebrate Kirk's death but exercised restraint while condemning hatred and violence. She referenced Kirk's own words in one post and encouraged people to sign up for her online course on race and the media. The Washington Post declined to comment on Attah's claims.
