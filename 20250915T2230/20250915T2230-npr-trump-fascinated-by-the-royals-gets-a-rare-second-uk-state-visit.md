## Article summary
President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are set to make a rare second state visit to the United Kingdom, invited by King Charles III. This unprecedented honor follows Trump's admiration for the royal family, which stems partly from his mother's fascination with Queen Elizabeth II. The visit, scheduled for February 27, 2025, includes meetings with the royal family, a carriage procession, military bands, and a state banquet at Windsor Castle. The UK hopes to leverage Trump's interest in the monarchy to influence his support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Despite Trump's unpopularity in the UK, the visit is seen as a strategic diplomatic move. Trump's fascination with the royals extends beyond glamour, as he has expressed admiration for Princess Diana and commented on recent royal family drama. Historian Nicole Hemmer notes that Trump's interest in the royals aligns with his views on presidential power and monarchy, which he has praised as a unifying force for the UK.
