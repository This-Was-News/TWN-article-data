## Article summary
A record number of congressional lawmakers, totaling 10 senators and 27 House members, have announced they will not seek reelection in 2026. Fifteen are retiring from public office, while others are running for different positions, such as governor, Senate seats, or state attorney general. More Republicans (27) than Democrats (10) are leaving Congress. Notable Democratic retirees include Senators Dick Durbin and Jeanne Shaheen, and Representatives Jan Schakowsky, Dwight Evans, and Danny Davis. Among Republicans, Senators Mitch McConnell, Thom Tillis, and Jon Ernst, along with Representative Don Bacon, are retiring. The GOP, holding slim majorities in both chambers, has engaged in mid-decade gerrymandering to secure more favorable districts ahead of a challenging election cycle. California's Democratic government is seeking voter approval for a retaliatory redistricting measure, while Texas' redrawn map aims to reduce Democratic representation, prompting 78-year-old Representative Lloyd Doggett to retire.
