## Article summary
On the Charlie Kirk Show, guest-hosted by Vice President JD Vance, high-ranking Trump administration officials discussed plans for a broad crackdown on liberal groups. They alleged a left-wing network funds and incites violence, citing the killing of activist Charlie Kirk, though investigators are still determining the motive. The White House and President Trump's allies claimed the suspect was part of a coordinated movement targeting conservatives, without presenting evidence. Senior administration officials revealed that cabinet secretaries and federal department heads are identifying organizations that fund or support violence against conservatives, aiming to categorize such activity as domestic terrorism. Critics warn this could suppress anti-conservative dissent. The podcast, featuring White House officials like Stephen Miller, detailed plans to target leftist nongovernmental organizations and was broadcast in the White House briefing room and West Wing offices.
