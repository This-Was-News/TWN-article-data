## Article summary
The web page discusses the trend of using magnesium lotion for sleep, promoted by influencers on social media. Magnesium is an essential mineral, but there's little scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness when applied topically. Despite claims that magnesium lotion can improve sleep and address various health issues, experts argue that the skin is not an effective barrier for absorption. Dermatologist Nicholas Theodosakis suggests that any benefits may come from the massage or moisturizing ingredients rather than the magnesium itself. While some users report positive experiences, there's no scientific proof to support these claims. Sleep expert Dr. John Winkelman acknowledges the placebo effect but remains skeptical due to the lack of evidence. The FDA does not regulate supplements like drugs, so there's no guarantee of their efficacy. Experts agree that while magnesium lotion is unlikely to harm users, it may not be effective and could be a waste of money. The page highlights the cultural and psychological factors driving the popularity of such health trends.
