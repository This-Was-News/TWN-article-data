## Article summary
The Democratic Party is facing internal divisions over Zohran Mamdani's bid for New York City mayor. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized party leaders for not endorsing Mamdani, while many New York Democrats in Congress remain silent. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, has garnered grassroots support but is being distanced by moderate Democrats and Republican opponents. Republicans, including Donald Trump, are linking Mamdani's far-left policies to the Democratic brand. New York Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani, urging unity against Trump, while Trump threatened to withhold federal funding if Mamdani wins. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have declined to endorse Mamdani, highlighting the political pressures they face. Mamdani's criticism of Israel and proposals for tax increases on the wealthy have deepened the divide within the party. Progressive groups and figures like Bernie Sanders are rallying behind Mamdani, seeing the race as a broader battle for the party's future. Republicans are actively campaigning against Democratic candidates by associating them with Mamdani. In New York, Mamdani faces competition from former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, both running as independents.
