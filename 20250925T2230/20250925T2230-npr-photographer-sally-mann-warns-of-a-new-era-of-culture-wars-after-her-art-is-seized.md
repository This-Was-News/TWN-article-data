## Article summary
Photographer Sally Mann's work has faced significant backlash after four of her photographs were seized from the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in Texas. The images, part of her *Immediate Family* series, depict her children in intimate and sometimes nude poses, which a conservative Christian advocacy group accused of being child pornography. The seizure has sparked concerns about a new era of culture wars and the potential chilling effect on other museums and artists. Mann, known for her unvarnished renderings of family life, has expressed fear that her art could be seized and that history is being rewritten. She has also reconsidered plans to donate her estate to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts due to funding risks. Despite her success, Mann advises young artists to be prepared for obscurity and rejection, emphasizing the importance of persistence and quality work.
