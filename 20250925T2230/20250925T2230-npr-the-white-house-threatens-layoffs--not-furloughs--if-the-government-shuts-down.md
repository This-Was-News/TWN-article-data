## Article summary
The White House has threatened to lay off federal workers rather than furlough them if the government shuts down on October 1. This approach, outlined in a memo obtained by NPR, marks a shift from past shutdowns where employees were temporarily sent home without pay. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plans to use the funding dispute to permanently eliminate workers in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. Budget Director Russell Vought has been pushing to cut government programs funded by Congress, including foreign aid and public broadcasting. House Republicans have passed a funding bill through November 21, but Senate Democrats are insisting on adding measures like Affordable Care Act subsidies. Trump canceled a meeting with Democratic leaders, accusing them of making unreasonable demands. The OMB suggests layoffs could be avoided if Democrats support the House bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the memo an attempt at intimidation, arguing the firings are unnecessary. Democrats are under pressure to stand firm against Trump after supporting a spending bill in March. This plan contrasts with Trump's first-term approach, where he kept most of the government open during a 35-day shutdown and promised back pay for furloughed workers.
