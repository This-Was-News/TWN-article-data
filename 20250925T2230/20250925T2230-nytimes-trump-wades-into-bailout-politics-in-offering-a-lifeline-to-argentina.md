## Article summary
The U.S. Treasury Department, under the Trump administration, is considering a $20 billion loan to support Argentina's President Javier Milei, despite economic and political risks. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that while New York City might not receive a bailout under Mayor Zohran Mamdani, Argentina is a different case. The support aims to bolster Milei's struggling presidency, with President Trump viewing him as a political ally. This move contrasts with Republicans' traditional opposition to bailouts and ties the U.S. to Argentina's financial struggles, marked by high inflation and debt. American agricultural groups, already hurt by Trump's trade war with China, have criticized the move. China's retaliatory tariffs have made Argentine soybeans cheaper than U.S. soybeans, raising concerns about a farm crisis in rural America.
