## Article summary
A facility in Broadview, a Chicago suburb, has become the center of a federal immigration crackdown, with accusations of inhumane conditions. The Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement in the area, leading to hundreds of arrests. Relatives, lawyers, and activists report that up to 200 people are held in the facility, which lacks basic amenities like showers and a cafeteria. Detainees describe being given little food, water, and limited access to medication, with communication severely restricted. Officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have not responded to requests for information or tours. Illinois has strict sanctuary laws and banned immigration detention in 2021, but the Broadview facility is being used for extended detentions. Protests outside the facility have grown, with federal agents using force to disperse demonstrators. Local officials and immigrant rights advocates allege that the Trump administration is creating unbearable conditions to pressure detainees into self-deportation. The facility has caused tensions in the small community, diverting police resources and prompting concerns from village leaders. The Mexican consulate is among the few entities communicating with authorities, assisting detained Mexican nationals. The situation has sparked unprecedented fear and suffering among immigrant communities.
