## Article summary
A senior Justice Department official has instructed multiple U.S. attorneys' offices to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, listing potential charges. This directive suggests the department is following President Trump's orders to target specific individuals or groups, marking a departure from past practices that shielded the agency from political influence. The move aligns with recent actions against Trump's perceived enemies, including former FBI Director James B. Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump has publicly targeted Soros, accusing him of backing progressive causes and allegedly promoting civil unrest. Soros's Open Society Foundations funds democratic initiatives worldwide, including human rights and equity efforts. Republicans, including Trump, claim the foundation fosters unrest, while liberals deny these accusations, calling them attempts to suppress dissent.
