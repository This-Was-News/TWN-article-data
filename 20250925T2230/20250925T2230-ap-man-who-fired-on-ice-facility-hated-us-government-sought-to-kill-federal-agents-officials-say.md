## Article summary
A gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas, driven by hatred for the U.S. government and a desire to kill federal agents. Jahn, who acted alone, targeted the ICE office building and a van carrying detainees, resulting in one detainee's death and two others critically wounded. No ICE personnel were hurt. Handwritten notes found at Jahn's home revealed his intent to cause terror and his awareness that he might not survive the attack. The gunman, who fired from a nearby rooftop, had conducted extensive pre-attack planning and had searched for ballistics information and ICE agent tracking apps. FBI Director Kash Patel shared a note indicating Jahn's hope to instill fear in ICE agents. The attack occurred amid heightened immigration enforcement and backlash against ICE agents. Investigators found no evidence linking Jahn to any specific group, though his notes criticized ICE agents. The gunman legally obtained the rifle used in the shooting. Authorities have not released the names of the victims. The incident has led to increased security at ICE facilities nationwide.
