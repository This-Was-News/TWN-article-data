## Article summary
Former top economic officials, including Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen, have urged the Supreme Court to maintain the Federal Reserve's independence and allow Lisa Cook to retain her position as a Fed governor. The justices are considering an emergency appeal from the Trump administration to remove Cook while her lawsuit challenging her firing proceeds. Cook's potential removal is unprecedented, as no president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the agency's 112-year history. A judge previously ruled that Trump's move to fire Cook was likely illegal, and an appeals court rejected an emergency plea to oust her before a recent Fed meeting. The former officials argue that removing Cook would expose the Fed to political influences and erode public confidence. Cook has denied any wrongdoing regarding mortgage fraud allegations, and documents undercut the administration's claims. The Supreme Court has cautioned that it views the Fed differently from other independent agencies where Trump has dismissed board members at will.
