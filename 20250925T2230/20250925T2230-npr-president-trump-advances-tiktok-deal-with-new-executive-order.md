## Article summary
President Trump signed an executive order approving a deal for a U.S. investor consortium to take over TikTok, ensuring the app remains available in the U.S. while addressing national security concerns. The deal requires ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to divest, reducing its ownership to less than 20% and transferring control to American investors. Key investors include Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, Michael Dell, and Silver Lake. The new entity will be valued at around $14 billion and will have a board of directors to protect user privacy. Trump's approval marks a shift from his earlier attempts to ban TikTok, citing its popularity among young voters. The deal comes amid broader U.S.-China tensions and follows a law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping discussed the deal, with Xi giving approval. Both leaders plan future meetings, including a summit in South Korea and a potential visit to China by Trump.
