## Article summary
The White House's threat to conduct mass federal layoffs in the event of a government shutdown has intensified the standoff between Democratic leaders and the G.O.P. With only five days left to fund the government, the Trump administration aims to pressure Democrats into accepting a short-term deal. Democratic leaders, including Representative Hakeem Jeffries, have refused to be intimidated by the threat of mass firings. The move is seen as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to cut federal programs and personnel, a goal long advocated by conservative Republicans. The lack of negotiations between the parties highlights the deep intransigence gripping both sides as they head toward a potentially disruptive shutdown on October 1. Democrats have condemned the threat and vowed not to drop their demands for health care spending concessions. President Trump has accused Democrats of being unrealistic and blamed them for any potential lapse in funding. The situation underscores the opposing political incentives and policy motivations driving the impasse.
