## Article summary
A report by President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explores potential causes of autism, including vaccines and acetaminophen use during pregnancy. While autism diagnoses have risen significantly in the U.S. over the past 25 years, experts attribute this increase to greater awareness and broader diagnostic criteria. The report revisits the discredited theory that vaccines may contribute to autism, despite extensive scientific studies refuting this claim. Additionally, the report suggests a possible link between acetaminophen, found in Tylenol, and autism when taken during pregnancy, though evidence remains inconclusive. The document underscores the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors in autism's development, reflecting decades of research.
