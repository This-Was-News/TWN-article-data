## Article summary
Unease is growing within the Justice Department as President Trump's direct and blunt threats to target his political adversaries escalate. Trump's recent social media posts have alarmed government attorneys, as he demands immediate criminal investigations into prominent critics like former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Senator Adam Schiff. This follows the resignation of a top federal prosecutor in northern Virginia who refused to pursue charges against James. The new U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, lacks prosecutorial experience and has been involved in removing 'improper ideology' from the Smithsonian museums. Thousands of Justice Department employees have already left this year, including most of the public integrity unit and three-quarters of the civil rights division lawyers. Many remaining employees fear for their job security, given Trump's willingness to fire prosecutors who do not comply with his demands. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defends Trump's actions as a means to restore accountability. The traditional distance between the White House and criminal investigations has diminished, raising concerns about the rule of law. Legal experts, including George Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg, criticize Trump's open bragging about seeking retribution against political enemies. Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith questions the ethics of political appointees supporting an administration indifferent to the law. Grand juries and magistrate judges have recently shown skepticism, which may impact future cases. Judges may now view Trump's demands as a violation of equal justice under law.
