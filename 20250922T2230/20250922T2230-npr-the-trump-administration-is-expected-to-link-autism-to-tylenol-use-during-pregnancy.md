## Article summary
The Trump administration is expected to announce that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, may increase the risk of autism when used during pregnancy, despite a lack of conclusive scientific evidence. The administration will also suggest using a form of vitamin B, typically used in cancer treatment, as a potential treatment for autism. President Trump has hinted at a major medical announcement, claiming they have found an answer to autism. This move follows a pattern of the administration questioning the science behind commonly used medications. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously targeted various factors, including vaccines and painkillers, as potential causes of autism. However, scientific consensus indicates that genetics play a central role in autism risk, and studies have not found a significant link between acetaminophen use and autism. Medical groups continue to recommend acetaminophen for treating fever and pain in pregnant women, warning of potential harms from untreated conditions. The administration's proposal to use leucovorin, a form of vitamin B, is based on limited research suggesting it could address metabolic differences in some individuals with autism. However, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is minimal, and more research is needed to confirm any potential benefits.
