## Article summary
Since Charlie Kirk's assassination, President Donald Trump and his allies have praised Kirk as a free speech champion. Trump emphasized the importance of open debate and reason, yet his administration and supporters have targeted critics of Kirk and celebrated disciplinary actions against them. Trump welcomed Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, which was later reversed by ABC, and suggested revoking broadcast licenses for networks critical of him. Allies defend this as replacing cancel culture with consequence culture, but critics fear a broader crackdown on expression. Conservatives have historically opposed cancel culture but now demonstrate inconsistencies under Trump's leadership. Some Trump allies, like Tucker Carlson, warn against eroding First Amendment protections. Kirk was known for criticizing universities for restricting free speech. The article highlights the contradictions in Trump's approach to free speech, with some conservatives expressing concern over potential authoritarian measures. Turning Point USA, founded by Kirk, has not directly commented on the shift in Trump's stance on free speech.
