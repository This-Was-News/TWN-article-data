## Article summary
The Supreme Court will consider expanding President Donald Trump's power to fire members of independent agencies by overturning a 90-year-old ruling. The court allowed Trump to fire Democratic FTC member Rebecca Slaughter while the case is ongoing, signaling a potential shift in precedent. The conservative majority may overturn or narrow a 1935 decision that limits presidential removals to cases of misconduct or neglect. The court will hear arguments in December on whether to overturn the Humphreys Executor ruling, which protected agency members from arbitrary firing. The Justice Department argues Trump should have the power to fire board members at will to execute his agenda. Critics warn that unchecked presidential power could politicize regulatory decisions. The court is acting unusually early in the process, before the case has fully progressed through lower courts. The FTC, NLRB, and MSPB are among the agencies affected by these decisions. The court rejected requests to hear related cases from other board members, which will continue through lower courts.
