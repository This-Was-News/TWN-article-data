## Article summary
The fall foliage season is approaching in the Northern Hemisphere, with leaves changing color due to shorter days and cooler temperatures. Trees shed their leaves to store nutrients before winter, revealing vibrant hues of orange, yellow, and red as chlorophyll breaks down. Peak foliage varies by location, typically starting in the northern states by mid-September and spreading southward. This year, northern areas of the West and Midwest are expected to peak by October 4, followed by New England and the Pacific Northwest by October 11. Factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall, and pests influence the timing and intensity of leaf color changes. Climate change has delayed fall foliage by about a week since the mid-20th century. Weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and vibrancy of fall colors. Fall foliage tourism generates significant revenue, especially in New England. Peak foliage usually lasts seven to ten days, but weather conditions can shorten or prolong it. Drought conditions in New England are causing some leaves to turn brown, while other areas may see deeper reds. Despite variations, there are always locations with vibrant fall foliage, and exploring different elevations and landscapes can enhance the experience.
