## Article summary
The Trump administration has imposed restrictions on Iranian diplomats in the U.S., barring them from shopping at wholesale clubs like Costco and purchasing luxury goods without State Department approval. This move aims to prevent Iranian officials from exploiting diplomatic privileges to obtain goods unavailable to the Iranian public. The restrictions, announced in the Federal Register, require prior approval for memberships at wholesale club stores and purchases of luxury items valued over $1,000 or vehicles over $60,000. The administration cited the need to support the Iranian people amid economic hardships. This action is part of a broader crackdown on visas, including denying visas to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and considering restrictions on delegations from Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Brazil. The U.S. aims to send a clear message of solidarity with the Iranian people while targeting the regime's elites.
