## Article summary
Obtaining this year's COVID booster shot has become more challenging due to recent changes in vaccine approval and recommendations. The FDA initially narrowed its approval to those 65 and older and high-risk individuals. The CDC's advisory group later recommended that adults 65 and older, as well as younger people, can receive the shot after consulting with a clinician about the risks and benefits, a process known as shared clinical decision-making. This shift means the vaccine is no longer routinely recommended for everyone. Pharmacists are equipped to conduct these consultations, and most states should allow vaccinations without additional prescriptions. Insurance coverage may vary, with potential issues for Medicaid, but major insurers plan to cover the shots without co-pays through 2026. The CDC lists risk factors for severe COVID-19, including common conditions like asthma and obesity. Children over 6 months old can receive the vaccine after a consultation, with Moderna's vaccine approved for the youngest age group. Vaccine supply is expected to be sufficient, but some doctors may not stock the shot due to anticipated low demand. Pharmacy chains and vaccine manufacturers offer online scheduling tools. Pregnant individuals are advised to get the booster shot, which protects both moms and newborns, despite recent confusing statements from health officials.
