## Article summary
President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released a report suggesting a potential link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, despite inconclusive scientific evidence. Trump advised pregnant women to avoid Tylenol, sparking concern among medical experts who emphasize its safety for treating fevers and pain. The FDA requested updates to drug labels and endorsed leucovorin for autism symptoms, though its efficacy remains unproven. Trump also defended Medicaid cuts and touted his administration's efforts to lower drug prices. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to fire an FTC commissioner, sparking debates over executive power. Additionally, Jimmy Kimmel's show was temporarily suspended after controversial remarks about a conservative activist's murder, leading to discussions on free speech and government influence. A federal judge permitted the resumption of a halted wind farm project, and a New York City mayoral candidate protested Kimmel's suspension by canceling a town hall appearance.
