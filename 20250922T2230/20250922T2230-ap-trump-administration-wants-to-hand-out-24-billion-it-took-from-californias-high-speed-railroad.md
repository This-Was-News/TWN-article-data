## Article summary
The Trump Administration plans to redistribute $2.4 billion, originally allocated for California's high-speed rail project, into a new $5 billion program aimed at boosting passenger rail traffic nationwide. The new program prioritizes projects in areas with higher birth and marriage rates and focuses on improving safety at railroad crossings. It removes references to diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and climate change from grant requirements. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom's high-speed rail project, calling it a 'boondoggle.' California officials plan to fight this redistribution, stating the decision to pull federal funding was unlawful and unwarranted. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) emphasized safety as the top priority and highlighted the need to address railroad crossings, where over 200 people die annually. Some funds will also go toward improving freight railroads used by Amtrak. The program includes amenities like nursing rooms and children's play areas in train stations. Applications for the funding are due by January 7.
