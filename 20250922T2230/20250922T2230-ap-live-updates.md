## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced new FDA recommendations linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism, despite lacking medical evidence. Scientists and advocacy groups have debunked any link between vaccines and autism. The FDA is also considering approving a discontinued drug for autism patients, though experts call for more rigorous studies. Meanwhile, Trump is facing criticism for urging the Justice Department to prosecute political foes and for his administration's handling of various issues, including a border czar under investigation and a halted offshore wind farm project. Trump is set to address the U.N. General Assembly, where he will discuss American strength and meet with world leaders. Additionally, the administration is appealing a court ruling on deportations and has restricted Iranian diplomats' shopping privileges. Trump also announced plans to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Ben Carson and revealed negotiations over TikTok's future, with Oracle set to receive the app's algorithm.
