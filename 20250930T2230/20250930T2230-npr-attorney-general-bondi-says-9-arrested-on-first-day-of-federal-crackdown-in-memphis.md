## Article summary
A federal operation is underway in Memphis, with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi reporting nine arrests and the confiscation of two illegal firearms. Meanwhile, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized the deployment of federal troops, calling it a threat to public safety. President Trump has proposed sending troops to Chicago and other cities to address violent crime, facing criticism for testing the limits of presidential authority. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry requested the deployment of 1,000 National Guard troops to several cities. Bondi mentioned that 219 National Guard members have been deputized as special U.S. Marshals, following a similar blueprint used in D.C. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced that agents from 13 U.S. agencies will support local law enforcement in Memphis. Oregon is preparing to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, despite legal challenges from state and city leaders. The deployment aims to safeguard ICE facilities, but critics argue it is an overreach of federal power.
