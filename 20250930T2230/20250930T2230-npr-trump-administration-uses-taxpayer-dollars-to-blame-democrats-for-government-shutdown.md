## Article summary
The Trump administration is blaming Democrats for the impending government shutdown through internal communications and public websites, which experts suggest may violate federal ethics laws. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's website features a banner and popup message accusing the 'Radical Left' of causing the shutdown. Multiple federal agencies received emails from the White House Office of Management and Budget, stating that Democrats are blocking a clean Continuing Resolution. Similar messages were sent to staff at various departments and agencies, including the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Labor, State, Treasury, Justice, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services. The Department of Veterans Affairs also used partisan language, blaming 'radical liberals' for potential service disruptions. The inclusion of political messages in federal communications has raised concerns about violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits civil servants from engaging in political activity while on duty. Ethics experts argue that the messages violate the spirit of the law by politicizing the shutdown. The tone and blame directed at one political party are unusual compared to previous administrations' communications during shutdowns. Federal employees are on edge as the White House has threatened to fire some workers during a shutdown rather than temporarily furloughing them.
