## Article summary
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued Zillow and Redfin, alleging an illegal deal to suppress competition in online rental advertising. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, claims that Zillow paid Redfin $100 million in February, leading Redfin to end contracts with advertising partners and stop competing ads for multifamily properties for up to nine years. The FTC also alleges that Redfin fired hundreds of employees and helped Zillow hire them. The FTC argues that this agreement reduces competition, potentially leading to higher prices and fewer choices for customers. Zillow maintains that the agreement benefits renters and property managers, while Redfin, which was acquired by Rocket Companies, disagrees with the FTC's allegations and is confident in its legal position. The FTC seeks to end the deal and possibly require divestiture or business reconstruction to restore competition.
