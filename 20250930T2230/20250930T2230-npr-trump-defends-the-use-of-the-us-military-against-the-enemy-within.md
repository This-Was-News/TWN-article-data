## Article summary
President Trump defended using U.S. troops in American cities, calling the 'enemy within' a significant threat. He suggested using cities with high crime rates as military training grounds. The Posse Comitatus Act limits federal troops' involvement in domestic law enforcement. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth discussed deploying National Guard troops to Chicago and Portland. The Department of Defense was renamed the Department of War, emphasizing its purpose as 'war fighting.' Hegseth criticized the military's previous direction, calling it the 'woke department,' and announced stricter fitness and appearance standards. He also ordered a review of the Pentagon's definitions of toxic leadership and hazing. Trump highlighted his global peacemaking efforts and criticized political rivals. The gathering of military leaders posed operational and national security challenges. Speculation arose that Hegseth might use the occasion to reduce the number of admirals and generals.
