## Article summary
President Donald Trump proposed using American cities as training grounds for the military and spoke about combating what he called an 'invasion from within.' He was joined by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who announced new directives for troops, including gender-neutral physical fitness standards. The meeting, attended by military leaders, focused on reshaping Pentagon culture and enlisting military resources for domestic purposes. Trump encouraged the audience to applaud and suggested that those who disagreed could leave, though the military leaders remained mostly stone-faced. Hegseth criticized 'woke' policies and promoted a return to traditional standards, including stricter fitness requirements and a focus on male-level standards for combat roles. Some military officials expressed concerns about the remarks, while others found Hegseth's message appealing. Senator Jack Reed criticized the meeting as a dangerous dereliction of leadership. Trump has previously tested the limits of the Posse Comitatus Act by deploying troops to various cities and the U.S.-Mexico border. Hegseth also announced plans to ease disciplinary rules and review definitions of toxic leadership and hazing. The speech came amid potential government shutdowns and other unusual actions by the administration.
