## Article summary
The U.S. government is on the brink of a shutdown at midnight, with no signs of a last-minute compromise between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans propose a short-term funding measure, but Democrats demand Medicaid cuts be reversed and tax credits extended. Neither side is willing to budge, and the House is not expected to vote this week. A shutdown would furlough non-excepted employees, while excepted employees, including those protecting life and property, would continue working without pay. Essential services like FBI investigations, air traffic control, and social security payments would continue. Furloughed workers would receive back pay once the shutdown ends, but financial stress is expected for many families. The U.S. Postal Service would remain unaffected. The Trump administration has threatened mass firings of federal workers, a more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns. Agencies have developed shutdown plans outlining which workers would stay on the job and which would be furloughed. The impact on the economy would be minimal for a short shutdown but could lead to uncertainties and negative effects if prolonged.
