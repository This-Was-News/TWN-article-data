## Article summary
Scientists have created human eggs using genes from adult skin cells, a breakthrough that could help infertile women and gay couples have genetically related children. Led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health & Science University, the research published in Nature Communications involves a technique similar to that used to clone Dolly the sheep. The team produced 82 functional eggs by replacing the DNA of a donor egg with DNA from a skin cell and inducing a unique cell division process called 'mitomeiosis.' Nine percent of the fertilized eggs developed to the blastocyst stage, but all had genetic abnormalities. While promising, the technology raises ethical, social, and legal concerns, including the potential for 'designer babies' and unauthorized use of DNA. Despite these challenges, experts believe the technology is worth pursuing with proper oversight, as it could offer hope to millions struggling with infertility.
