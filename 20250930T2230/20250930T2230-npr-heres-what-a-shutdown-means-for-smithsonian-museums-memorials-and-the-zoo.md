## Article summary
A government shutdown in Washington, D.C. typically leads to the closure of Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, which rely heavily on federal funding. The Smithsonian's 21 museums and the National Zoo may close, although they might stay open briefly using prior-year funds. The National Zoo's webcams will be turned off, but animals will continue to be cared for. Outdoor memorials like the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials will remain accessible, while tours of sites like the U.S. Capitol and FBI will likely be suspended. The Kennedy Center, funded by private dollars for events and performances, will not be impacted. Ford's Theatre will close its daytime museum and Petersen House but will keep performances and exhibits open. Many museums and cultural sites not reliant on federal funding will remain open, offering alternatives for visitors.
