## Article summary
President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed top military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico, discussing partisan issues and military policies. Trump criticized Democratic-run cities, suggesting they could be training grounds for the military, and praised his own policies while insulting former President Biden. Hegseth announced stricter standards for fitness and grooming, rejecting 'woke garbage' and emphasizing a 'warrior ethos.' The event, which gathered senior military leaders from around the world, was met with silence and criticism from former military officials. Critics questioned the cost and purpose of the gathering, with some calling it a political stunt. Trump also directed military actions in the Caribbean and deployed National Guard troops to several cities, facing objections from local leaders. The meeting was unprecedented in scope, raising concerns about the use of military leaders for political messaging.
