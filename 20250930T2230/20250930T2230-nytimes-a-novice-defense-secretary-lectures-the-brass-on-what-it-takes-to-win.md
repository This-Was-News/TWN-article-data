## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lectured senior military officers on fitness, grooming, and standards, emphasizing a return to traditional values. He criticized the military for lowering standards to meet racial and gender quotas, arguing that this had weakened the force. Hegseth's speech focused on his experiences in Iraq and his time as a major in the Army National Guard, advocating for stricter grooming and fitness standards. He claimed that the military had lost its ability to win wars since World War II and that fixing these issues was the first step toward repairing it. The speech was poorly received by some senior officers, who felt insulted by his suggestions that their failure to enforce standards contributed to military failings. Hegseth's leadership style has been characterized by a focus on physical training and early morning runs with troops. His speech was followed by a rambling address from President Trump, who criticized the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan. Hegseth's vision of military strength was criticized for not acknowledging the complex and shifting security challenges of today. He divided senior leaders into 'woke' and 'war fighters,' encouraging them to be apolitical and hard-charging. The speech was seen as a nostalgic look back to the World War II era, ignoring the changes in military operations and global security challenges.
