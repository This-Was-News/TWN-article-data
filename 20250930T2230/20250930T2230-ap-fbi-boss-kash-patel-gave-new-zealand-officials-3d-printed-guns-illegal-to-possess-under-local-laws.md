## Article summary
The U.S. government is on the brink of a shutdown due to a stalemate between Congress and the Trump administration over health care and spending bills. Maryland, with many federal employees and facilities, is particularly concerned about the impact on jobs and programs like SNAP and TANF. The Education Department would halt many operations, furloughing 87% of its workforce. Courts and national parks face disruptions, with parks potentially closing to protect resources. Sen. Tammy Duckworth criticized Trump's use of military for domestic purposes and his defense secretary's policies. Democrats demand health care extensions, while Republicans refuse to negotiate. Labor unions sued the administration over plans to fire federal workers during a shutdown. The shutdown could affect millions of federal employees and programs, with both sides blaming each other for the impasse.
