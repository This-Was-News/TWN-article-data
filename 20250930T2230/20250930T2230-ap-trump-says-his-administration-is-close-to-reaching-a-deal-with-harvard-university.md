## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that his administration is close to finalizing a deal with Harvard University, which has been under investigation and faced funding cuts. The agreement includes a $500 million payment from Harvard to establish trade schools focusing on AI and other skills. A deal would resolve sanctions, including cuts to research grants and federal contracts, and potentially restore funding. Earlier, a federal judge ordered the administration to reverse research funding cuts, deeming them illegal retaliation. The administration has previously reached agreements with Columbia and Brown to restore federal research funding. Harvard and the White House did not immediately comment on the developments.
