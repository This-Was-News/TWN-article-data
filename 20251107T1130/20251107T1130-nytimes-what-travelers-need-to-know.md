## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown is causing significant disruptions in air travel, with the Trump administration announcing a 10 percent cut in flights at 40 U.S. airports. These reductions are set to begin and gradually increase, potentially impacting smaller airports more severely as airlines may prioritize international over regional flights. The cuts aim to ease pressure on air traffic controllers, who are working without pay and experiencing elevated absence rates. Travelers whose flights are canceled are advised to check airline websites for rebooking options or refunds, and to be aware of their rights regarding refunds for significantly delayed flights. Many airlines are waiving cancellation and change fees, and some, like United, are offering full refunds even for non-directly affected flights. Travelers are encouraged to monitor flight statuses, check seat maps for potential cancellations, and be aware that flights to smaller cities are more vulnerable. Travel insurance may not cover cancellations due to the shutdown if the policy was purchased after the shutdown was publicly known. International travel is expected to be less affected by direct flight cuts, but travelers should still anticipate airport chaos. For those who haven't booked Thanksgiving travel, prices are expected to rise due to decreased flight availability. Alternatives like Amtrak and bus services such as Greyhound and FlixBus are preparing for increased demand as travelers seek options other than flying.
