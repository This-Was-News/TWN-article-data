## Article summary
The ongoing government shutdown has delayed the release of official employment and unemployment reports for the second consecutive month, leaving economists and policymakers to rely on alternative data to assess the job market. While some private sector reports indicate an increase in hiring, others show a significant rise in layoff notices, creating a mixed picture. Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook acknowledged the challenges posed by the data disruption but stated that the Fed is not operating "blind," utilizing private sector data and business contacts. Employee sentiment, as measured by Glassdoor, has declined, with workers feeling less confident about job availability and having less leverage. This sentiment is likely influenced by high-profile layoffs announced by companies like Amazon and UPS. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported the worst October for job cut announcements in over two decades, with tech and warehousing sectors leading the downsizing. Despite these concerns, state unemployment claims have remained stable, and ADP reported a modest increase in private-sector jobs in October. However, this hiring growth is described as modest compared to earlier in the year. Official data prior to the shutdown showed a slowdown in job growth, with only 22,000 jobs added in August. Factors such as the retirement of baby boomers and reduced foreign-born workers may contribute to fewer available workers. While the overall unemployment rate in August was 4.3%, which is historically low, concerns exist about sharper increases in unemployment for young and African American workers, suggesting a potential "two-speed" economy.
