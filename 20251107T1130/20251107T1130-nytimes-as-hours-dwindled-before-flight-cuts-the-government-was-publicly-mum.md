## Article summary
As travelers anxiously awaited news of flight cancellations due to air traffic control reductions, government agencies remained largely silent throughout Thursday. The Transportation Department and Federal Aviation Administration only released the official list of 40 affected airports late Thursday evening, with less than 10 hours before the cuts were to begin. By then, airlines and news outlets had already begun informing passengers and airports of potential changes. This lack of timely guidance from the Trump administration intensified anxiety for travelers and airport operators alike. Critics suggested the cuts were a political tactic to pressure Democrats regarding the government shutdown, rather than a measure for flight safety or controller relief. Representative Steve Cohen stated it was a political move to force Democratic concessions on budget priorities. However, a statement accompanying the list of affected airports asserted the decision was not political. Airline officials and analysts have described these unprecedented cuts.
