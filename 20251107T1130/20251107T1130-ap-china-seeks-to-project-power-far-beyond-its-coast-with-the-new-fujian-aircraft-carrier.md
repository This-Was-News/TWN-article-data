## Article summary
China has commissioned its third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, marking a significant step in its military expansion and ambition to project power globally. Designed and built domestically, the Fujian features an electromagnetic launch system, a technology previously exclusive to the latest U.S. carriers, allowing it to operate heavier and more advanced aircraft. This development is seen as a key element in China's goal of establishing a "blue-water navy" capable of operating far from its shores and challenging U.S. naval dominance in the Indo-Pacific. Experts suggest the carrier's capabilities are crucial for China's strategic objectives, including asserting control in the near seas and contesting influence in the wider Pacific. While China's navy is rapidly modernizing, it still lags behind the U.S. in several areas, including the number of carriers, nuclear propulsion, and overseas bases. Neighboring countries, like Japan, have expressed concern over the lack of transparency in China's military buildup. The Fujian's advanced capabilities could play a role in potential scenarios such as a blockade of Taiwan, by extending China's operational reach and surveillance capabilities. Despite the impressive technological advancements, some analysts caution that China's real-world operational readiness may not yet match its showcased arsenal, and its military modernization serves broader strategic goals beyond just Taiwan. China is also reportedly developing nuclear propulsion for carriers and building more vessels at a pace unmatched by the U.S., indicating a continued effort to close the gap with American naval power.
