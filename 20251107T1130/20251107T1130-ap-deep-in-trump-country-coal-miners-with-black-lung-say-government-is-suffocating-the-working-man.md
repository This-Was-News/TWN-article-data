## Article summary
In West Virginia, respiratory therapists like Lisa Emery are witnessing a disturbing rise in black lung disease among coal miners, including younger individuals. This resurgence is attributed to miners extracting coal from deeper, rock-filled seams, increasing exposure to silica dust, which is significantly more toxic than coal dust. A proposed rule by the Mine Safety and Health Administration to halve the permissible silica dust exposure limit is now in jeopardy due to Trump administration cutbacks and industry opposition. Despite promises to support coal miners, the administration has pursued policies that roll back health and safety regulations, including delays and proposed weakening of protections. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), crucial for research and worker safety, has faced significant job cuts and funding reductions, impacting its ability to monitor and address occupational diseases. Miners and union leaders express anger and frustration, feeling forgotten and betrayed by policies that prioritize industry interests over worker well-being. Historical disasters, like the Hawks Nest tunnel tragedy, serve as stark reminders of the dangers of silica exposure. The fight for better protections is ongoing, with miners and advocates protesting against deregulation and demanding enforcement of vital safety standards. The current situation leaves many miners with irreversible lung damage, facing limited options and a grim prognosis, while the historical context highlights the long-standing struggle for worker safety in the mining industry.
