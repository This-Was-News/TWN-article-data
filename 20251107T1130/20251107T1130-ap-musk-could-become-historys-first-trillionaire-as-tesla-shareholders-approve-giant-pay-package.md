## Article summary
Elon Musk has been given a chance to become history's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders approved a massive pay package. The vote, which saw over 75% in favor, grants Musk stock worth $1 trillion if he meets ambitious performance targets over the next decade. This victory comes despite recent struggles for Tesla, including plunging sales and profits, and Musk's controversial ventures into politics and conspiracy theories. Many investors still view Musk as a "miracle man" capable of extraordinary business feats, citing his past success in pulling Tesla back from the brink of bankruptcy. The approved plan requires Musk to achieve significant increases in market value, deliver 20 million vehicles, and deploy 1 million robots. Critics, however, argue the pay is excessive and that the board is too beholden to Musk, pointing to his recent erratic behavior. Supporters believe the incentive is necessary for Musk to focus on transforming Tesla into an AI powerhouse. The vote also allows Tesla to invest in Musk's other venture, xAI, and rejects a proposal to make it easier for shareholders to sue the company. Musk stated the vote was more about increasing his stake and power within Tesla to control its future robot army, which he fears could pose a danger to humanity if not managed by him.
