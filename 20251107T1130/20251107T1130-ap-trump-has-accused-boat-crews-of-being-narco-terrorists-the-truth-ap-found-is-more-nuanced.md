## Article summary
The U.S. military has conducted strikes on over 17 boats since September, resulting in the deaths of more than 60 individuals, based on allegations by the Trump administration that these vessels were involved in drug smuggling and operated by "narco-terrorists." However, an investigation by the Associated Press reveals a more complex reality. The AP interviewed residents and relatives in Venezuela's Paria Peninsula, the departure point for many of these boats, and identified four of the deceased men. These individuals included a fisherman earning about $100 a month, a career criminal, a former military cadet, and a bus driver facing financial hardship. While some of the men were involved in drug smuggling, they were not necessarily high-ranking cartel members or "narco-terrorists" as claimed by the Trump administration. Many were laborers or low-level criminals taking these trips for the first time, motivated by economic desperation. The AP's findings challenge the administration's narrative, suggesting that the targeted individuals were often ordinary people caught in a cycle of poverty and crime. The strikes have been criticized by Venezuelan officials as "extrajudicial executions," and the U.S. government maintains its stance, with the Pentagon stating its intelligence confirms the individuals were "narco-terrorists."
