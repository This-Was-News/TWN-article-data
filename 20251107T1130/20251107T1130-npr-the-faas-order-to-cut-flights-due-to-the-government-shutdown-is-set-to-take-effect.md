## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered flight reductions nationwide due to the ongoing government shutdown. This unprecedented order, set to take effect Friday morning, impacts 40 airports across more than two dozen states, including major hubs like Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, and Charlotte. Multiple airports in metropolitan areas such as New York, Houston, Chicago, and Washington will be affected, with potential ripple effects reaching smaller airports. Airlines have already begun canceling flights in anticipation, with over 780 flights called off nationwide. Delta plans to scratch roughly 170 flights Friday, and American Airlines will cut 220 daily flights through Monday. The FAA stated the reductions, starting at 4% and increasing to 10% by November 14th, are necessary to alleviate pressure on air traffic controllers who have been working without pay for over a month. Many controllers are working six-day weeks with mandatory overtime, and increasing numbers are calling out due to financial strain and exhaustion. This situation highlights the personal impact of the shutdown, as travelers like Kelly Matthews have canceled trips due to the inability to afford essential expenses. The cuts could also impact package services, as two key distribution centers for FedEx and UPS are on the list of affected airports. Industry analysts warn of a noticeable impact on the U.S. air transportation system.
