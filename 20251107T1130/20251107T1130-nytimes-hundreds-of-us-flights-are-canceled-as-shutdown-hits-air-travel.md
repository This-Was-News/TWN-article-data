## Article summary
A wave of flight cancellations began in the United States on Friday as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented reductions to ease pressure on air traffic controllers working without pay due to the ongoing government shutdown. The FAA estimated that approximately 4 percent of daily flights at 40 major airports would be canceled, with major airlines stating that most customers would not be significantly affected. Over 815 flights were canceled by 6 a.m. Eastern on Friday, a sharp increase from the previous day. Airlines, accustomed to managing disruptions, indicated these cuts were manageable, especially with lower travel volume before Thanksgiving. However, if the shutdown persists, travel during the busy Thanksgiving period could be impacted. Major carriers like United, Delta, and American Airlines announced their expected cancellation numbers, aiming to minimize disruption to their hub operations and overall service. The FAA released a list of 40 affected airports, including major commercial hubs and cargo facilities. Travelers were advised on what to do if their flights were affected, with a focus on potential impacts to domestic and regional travel. Meanwhile, political negotiations to end the shutdown remained stalled, with significant disagreements between Republicans and Democrats.
