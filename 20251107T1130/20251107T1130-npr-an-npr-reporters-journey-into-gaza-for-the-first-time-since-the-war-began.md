## Article summary
NPR correspondent Daniel Estrin has returned to the Gaza Strip for the first time since the war began, entering the territory under a military escort provided by the Israeli military. The visit, nearly a month into a ceasefire, offered a stark view of destruction, particularly in the Shujaiya neighborhood, which Estrin remembers as once densely populated but is now a wasteland. The Israeli military has divided Gaza in half, with Palestinians unable to return to areas occupied by Israeli forces. During the tour, journalists were shown Hamas tunnel routes and learned about the ongoing efforts to find hostages. The Israeli military appears prepared for a long-term occupation of its controlled sector, while Hamas is regrouping on the other side. Access to Gaza remains tightly controlled, with journalists requiring escorts and facing military censorship. Efforts are underway by press associations to challenge Israel's Supreme Court for independent journalist access to Gaza.
