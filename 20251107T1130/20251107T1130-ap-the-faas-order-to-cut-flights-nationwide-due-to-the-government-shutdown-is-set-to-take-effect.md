## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an unprecedented order to reduce flights nationwide due to the ongoing government shutdown. This order, affecting 40 airports across more than two dozen states, is set to take effect on Friday morning. Major hubs like Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, and Charlotte are included, with multiple airports impacted in large metropolitan areas such as New York, Houston, Chicago, and Washington. Airlines began canceling flights on Thursday in anticipation, with over 810 flights already called off nationwide. Delta and American Airlines are among those significantly cutting their schedules through Monday. The FAA stated these reductions, starting at 4% and increasing to 10% by November 14th, are necessary to alleviate pressure on air traffic controllers who have been working without pay for over a month. Many controllers are experiencing exhaustion and financial strain, leading to increased absences. While airlines aim to minimize customer impact and may prioritize cuts to smaller cities, they are required to refund canceled flights. Industry analysts warn of a noticeable impact on the U.S. air transportation system, potentially affecting package delivery services as well.
