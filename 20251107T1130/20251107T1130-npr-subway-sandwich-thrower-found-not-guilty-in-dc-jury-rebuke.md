## Article summary
A jury found Sean Charles Dunn not guilty of assault for throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal officer in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred in August 2025 during a federal law enforcement deployment to the city. Dunn, who was later fired from his Justice Department job, had called the officers "racists and fascists" and believed they were preparing for an immigration raid. The federal agent, Gregory Lairmore, testified that the sandwich "exploded" and he smelled onions and mustard, but was unharmed. The case was initially pursued as a felony assault charge but was downgraded to a misdemeanor. Dunn's defense argued he was being singled out for his criticism of the Trump administration and that the act was harmless. The defense also highlighted the absurdity of the situation, noting the federal agent received gag gifts related to sandwiches. Dunn expressed relief and a desire to move on with his life following the jury's verdict after approximately seven hours of deliberation.
