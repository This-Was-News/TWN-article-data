## Article summary
The Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., released a report outlining a strategy to improve children's health by tackling chronic diseases. The report identifies four main drivers of chronic diseases among children: poor diet, chemical exposure, lack of physical activity, and chronic stress, as well as overmedicalization. It includes 128 recommendations, such as promoting dietary guidelines, reducing ultra-processed foods, increasing physical activity, and addressing chemical exposure. However, the report has drawn mixed reactions, with critics pointing out that its goals are undermined by recent administration policies, such as cuts to food assistance programs and changes in vaccine policy. The report also calls for new research into nutrition and chronic disease prevention, but lacks detailed plans for execution and resources. The strategy has been criticized for being uneven and not presenting a comprehensive blueprint for improving children's health.
