## Article summary
Scientists at the Institute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan are working to protect and breed the endangered Yangtze finless porpoise, a species whose population has significantly declined due to pollution, boat traffic, and illegal fishing. The Yangtze River, one of the world's busiest waterways, is home to a variety of aquatic life, including critically endangered species like the Chinese sturgeon. Researchers, led by hydrobiologist Wang Dong, are employing conservation efforts such as artificial breeding and releasing fish into the river to restore wild populations. The Yangtze River Protection Law, enacted in 2021, has helped increase the porpoise population to around 1,300. Despite these efforts, scientists call for additional measures to regulate shipping and extend the fishing ban. The Yangtze finless porpoise serves as a barometer of the river's health, highlighting the interconnectedness of aquatic species and the need for continued conservation.
