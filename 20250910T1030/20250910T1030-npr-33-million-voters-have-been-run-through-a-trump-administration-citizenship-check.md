## Article summary
The Trump administration's SAVE tool has checked the citizenship status of over 33 million voters, raising concerns about data security and accuracy. The system, updated in August, allows election officials to verify voters using partial Social Security numbers, names, and birth dates. While some Republican-led states have embraced SAVE, others express caution due to unanswered questions about data usage and privacy. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to inquiries from Congress or election officials. Concerns include the potential for eligible voters to be wrongly removed from rolls and the lack of transparency about SAVE's accuracy and data handling. Some states, like Louisiana, have identified small numbers of non-citizens on voter rolls, but the overall impact remains minimal. Critics worry about the administration's broader efforts to control elections and collect personal data, while supporters see SAVE as a useful tool for ensuring election integrity.
