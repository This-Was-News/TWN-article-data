## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has caused unease among President Trump and his aides due to his controversial views on vaccines and recent actions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Kennedy faced an awkward moment when he struggled to agree with Trump's statement that vaccines work, despite being a known vaccine skeptic. This incident highlighted the growing tensions between the two, as Kennedy has been generating negative headlines, including the recent firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, who Trump had previously praised. The White House has privately asked Kennedy to moderate his rhetoric on COVID-19 vaccines, as his criticism clashes with Trump's pride in Operation Warp Speed, the initiative that developed the vaccines during his first term. While there is no evidence of a break between Trump and Kennedy, the situation has created friction within the administration.
