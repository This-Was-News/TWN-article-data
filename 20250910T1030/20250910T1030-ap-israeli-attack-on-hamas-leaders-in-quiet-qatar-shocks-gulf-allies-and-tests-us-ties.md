## Article summary
Israel's recent airstrike on Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital, Doha, has sent shockwaves through the region and tested U.S. ties. Qatar, a key U.S. ally hosting the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, was caught off guard by the attack, which occurred amid U.S.-backed negotiations to end the Israel-Hamas war. The strike, which targeted a meeting of Hamas's exiled leadership, has raised questions about sovereignty and the reliability of U.S. security guarantees. Analysts suggest that Israel's actions may accelerate a trend among Gulf Arab states to diversify their relationships away from the U.S. and towards other global actors like China and Russia. The attack has also dampened hopes for further normalization of relations between Israel and Arab countries, with Saudi Arabia now insisting on Palestinian statehood as a condition for normalization. The strike has been seen as a message to the region, indicating that military pressure will continue, with the U.S. viewing Israel's dominance as effective. The attack has also cast doubt on the future of ceasefire negotiations, with Qatar's prime minister questioning the value of continuing talks in light of the strike.
