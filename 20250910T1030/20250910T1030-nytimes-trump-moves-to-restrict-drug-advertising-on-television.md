## Article summary
President Trump signed a memorandum directing his administration to reverse a decades-old policy that would likely restrict television advertising of prescription drugs. This move aligns with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s repeated calls for a ban on such ads, potentially impacting the revenues of pharmaceutical companies and major television networks. The proposal aims to undo a 1997 policy change that allowed extensive TV drug advertising, which is expected to face strong opposition from the drug industry. Past attempts to restrict drug advertising have been blocked by courts on First Amendment grounds. The White House plans to change the policy through a rule-making process. Dr. David Kessler, a former FDA commissioner, stated that the proposed approach would effectively remove direct-to-consumer advertising from television.
