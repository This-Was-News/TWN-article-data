## Article summary
Rupert Murdoch, 94, has appointed his oldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, 54, as the future leader of his conservative media empire, which includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post, among other outlets. This decision ends a long succession battle among Murdoch's children, with Lachlan emerging as the winner over his brother James, 52. Lachlan is seen as the likely heir to preserve the conservative identity of his father's portfolio, although he has a distinct approach to media ownership. Unlike his father, Lachlan is more hands-off and less likely to seek a 'kingmaker' role in Republican political circles. The succession process has been dramatic, involving courtrooms and boardrooms, and has inspired the HBO series 'Succession'. Lachlan Murdoch was born in London but grew up in New York City and has spent much of his adult life in Sydney, Australia. He started working at News Corp in 1994 but left for Australia in 2005 due to corporate machinations against him. He returned to the U.S. about a decade later and has since led the family empire, overseeing financial successes despite high-profile controversies. Lachlan's political beliefs are generally seen as more conservative than his father's, with a focus on the center-right in political news and opinion.
