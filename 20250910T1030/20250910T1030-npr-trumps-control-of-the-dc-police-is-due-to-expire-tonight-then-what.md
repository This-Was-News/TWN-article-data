## Article summary
President Trump's temporary control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is set to expire on Wednesday, as the Home Rule Act limits his authority to 30 days without congressional approval. Despite initial plans to extend this control, Trump has praised D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for cooperation and a reported drop in crime. Bowser has acknowledged the federal intervention's role in reducing crime but criticized the presence of immigration agents and National Guard troops, emphasizing the need for local control. Congress shows no interest in extending federal control, with House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer focusing on legislation to oversee D.C. affairs. The administration's attempt to appoint an emergency police commissioner was blocked in court, but local police have increased cooperation with federal agencies, leading to numerous arrests, many for immigration-related offenses. While crime statistics show a decrease, concerns about community trust and federal overreach persist. Democrats advocate for strengthening D.C.'s home rule, while Republicans propose increased federal control, including bills to repeal home rule and alter D.C.'s criminal justice system. The political tension highlights the ongoing debate over D.C.'s autonomy and federal intervention.
