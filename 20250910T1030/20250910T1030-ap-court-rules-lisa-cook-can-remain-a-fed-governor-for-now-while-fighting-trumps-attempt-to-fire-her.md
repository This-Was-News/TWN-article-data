## Article summary
A federal court ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her position while she challenges President Donald Trump's attempt to fire her. The ruling is a setback for Trump's efforts to gain more control over the traditionally independent Federal Reserve. Judge Jan Cobb granted Cook's request for a preliminary injunction, stating that the allegations against her were not sufficient legal cause for removal. Cook is accused of mortgage fraud related to properties she purchased before joining the Fed. The court noted that Fed governors can only be removed for actions taken during their time in office. The decision allows Cook to participate in the Fed's upcoming meeting, where a rate cut is expected. The case highlights the importance of the Fed's independence from political pressure. Economists warn that political interference could lead to higher inflation and increased borrowing costs. If Trump succeeds in replacing Cook, he could gain a majority on the Fed's governing board. Cook is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor and has an impressive academic background.
