## Article summary
The Trump administration is considering severe restrictions on medicines from China, which could significantly impact the American pharmaceutical industry and the availability of various drugs. A draft executive order threatens to cut off the supply of Chinese-invented experimental treatments, including those for cancer, obesity, heart disease, and Crohn's disease. Major pharmaceutical companies have been purchasing rights to these drugs. The prospect of the order has sparked intense lobbying efforts from two opposing groups, each with billions of dollars at stake. Prominent investors and corporate executives, including Peter Thiel, Sergey Brin, the Koch family, and staff at Jared Kushner's investment firm, argue for a decisive crackdown on China, viewing it as an existential threat to U.S. biotechnology. These investors have investments in struggling American biotech companies that are competing with China's surging biotech sector. On the other side are the world's largest drugmakers, such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which have been acquiring low-priced experimental drugs from China, outpacing smaller American biotech companies developing similar medicines.
