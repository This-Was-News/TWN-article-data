## Article summary
The article discusses how a 50% U.S. tariff on Brazilian coffee imports is driving American coffee roasters to seek alternatives, particularly from Colombia. In Popayán, Colombia, an auction is underway where roasters are bidding for specialty coffees, with some lots selling for significantly higher prices than regular Colombian coffee. Buyers like Scott Peterson from True Coffee Roasters are looking for alternatives to Brazilian coffee to mitigate costs, despite not wanting to damage relationships with Brazilian producers. The tariff, imposed by President Trump, has disrupted coffee markets and forced roasters to find new sources. Ted Stachura of Equator Coffees notes the difficulty in replacing Brazilian coffee's unique flavor profile but is exploring other origins. Colombian coffee, subject to a lower 10% tariff, has become more attractive. Buyers like Austin Caleb from Methodical Coffee are gradually replacing Brazilian beans with Colombian ones. Colombian growers, such as Wilton Bentez, are seeing increased demand, with exports to the U.S. tripling. However, analysts warn that this surge in demand could drive up coffee prices in Colombia and other low-tariff countries, potentially changing consumer habits. The situation could ease if Trump exempts Brazilian coffee from the tariffs, as he has done for other Brazilian products.
