## Article summary
Toddler Shamm Qudeh, suffering from severe malnutrition and a rare genetic metabolic disease, was evacuated from Gaza to Italy for medical treatment. Weighing just 4 kilograms upon arrival, she has since gained weight and is showing progress under the care of Dr. Daniele de Bras at Santobono Pausilipon Children's Hospital in Naples. Shamm's condition is managed through a high-carbohydrate diet, including a special porridge. Her family struggled to find proper medical care in Gaza due to an Israeli blockade and ongoing conflict. Over half a million people in Gaza face catastrophic hunger levels, with Gaza City experiencing famine. Shamm's story highlights the broader humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where thousands of children suffer from acute malnutrition. Despite improvements, Shamm's future remains uncertain amid the ongoing war.
