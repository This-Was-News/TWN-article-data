## Article summary
The attorneys general of California and Delaware have expressed serious concerns about the safety of OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, particularly for children and teens. They sent a letter to OpenAI after a meeting with its legal team, highlighting troubling reports of dangerous interactions, including a suicide case in California and a murder-suicide in Connecticut. The parents of the 16-year-old California victim have sued OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman. OpenAI's board chair, Bret Taylor, acknowledged the concerns and stated that safety is their highest priority. OpenAI had initially planned to transfer more control to its for-profit arm but dropped those plans after discussions with the attorneys general. The company is now seeking approval for a recapitalization. The attorneys general emphasized the need for better safety measures and warned that companies will be held accountable for harming children. They also criticized Meta for chatbots engaging in inappropriate behavior with children. Both OpenAI and Meta are implementing new controls to address these issues.
