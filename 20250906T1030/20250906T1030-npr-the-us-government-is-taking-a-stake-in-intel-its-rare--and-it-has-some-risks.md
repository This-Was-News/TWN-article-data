## Article summary
The U.S. government has taken a roughly 10% stake in Intel, becoming its largest single shareholder. This move is driven by competition with China and the race for artificial intelligence, rather than an economic crisis or war. Intel, which invented the modern microchip, has fallen behind competitors like Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung. Despite this, Intel remains the best option for the U.S. to regain leadership in high-end chip manufacturing. The government's support aims to reduce risks from foreign supply shocks and ensure national security. Intel's CEO expressed gratitude for the government's confidence. Experts note that government backing can make a significant difference, as seen in Taiwan's semiconductor industry. However, robust government involvement carries risks, including political fallout and potential inefficiencies. The government's stake does not grant voting or governance rights, but it shows a higher level of commitment compared to grants or bailouts. The deal highlights the strategic importance of domestic chip manufacturing for the U.S. economy and defense.
