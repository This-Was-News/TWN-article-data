Hundreds of mourners and VIPs, including Donatella Versace, paid their last respects to Italian fashion icon Giorgio Armani in Milan. Armani, who passed away at 91, was remembered for his extraordinary elegance and significant impact on the city and global fashion world. His fashion house noted that he worked up until his final days, with one of his last projects being a runway show marking 50 years of his signature brand. The public viewing took place in the Armani Theater, adorned with candles, music, and a sculpture from his bedside. Milan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, praised Armani's legacy and recalled a supportive phone call from him during a difficult time.
