## Article summary
Chicago's Mexican Independence Day celebrations are overshadowed by President Donald Trump's plans to send National Guard troops and immigration agents to the city, causing anxiety among Latino residents. The festivities, which typically span over a week and draw large crowds, are set to begin with a parade in the heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood. However, Trump's threats to increase federal enforcement in Chicago have led to widespread opposition and discussions about whether to proceed with the celebrations. Some events, like a downtown festival, have been postponed for safety reasons, while others are moving forward with precautions. Residents express disappointment and fear, feeling that the community is being targeted for political reasons. Despite the uncertainty, many are determined to celebrate their heritage, with some bringing passports as a precaution. Local businesses report lower sales due to reduced foot traffic, and community members are encouraged to support Latino-owned businesses during this time. The celebrations reflect the size and vitality of Chicago's Mexican-American community, which makes up a significant portion of the city's population.
