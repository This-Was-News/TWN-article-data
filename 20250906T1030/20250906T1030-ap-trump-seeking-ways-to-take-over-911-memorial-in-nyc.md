## Article summary
President Donald Trump's administration is exploring the possibility of taking federal control of the 9/11 memorial and museum in New York City. The memorial, located in lower Manhattan, features two pools with waterfalls and an underground museum, and has been managed by a public charity led by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg since its opening in 2014. The White House confirmed preliminary discussions about the idea, noting Trump's campaign pledge to make the site a national monument. However, officials at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum argue that current laws prevent the federal government from unilaterally taking over the site, which is located on land owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Critics, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul, have expressed concerns about the Trump administration's influence on how American history is presented in national monuments and museums. The memorial and museum have been financially self-sufficient, raising $750 million in private funds and welcoming over 90 million visitors. Despite some criticism from victims' families, supporters argue that the current management has effectively honored the legacy of the 9/11 attacks.
