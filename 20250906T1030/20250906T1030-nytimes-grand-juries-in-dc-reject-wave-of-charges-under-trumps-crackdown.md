## Article summary
Federal grand jurors in Washington, D.C. have repeatedly rejected charges in recent cases related to President Trump's immigration crackdown and show of force, suggesting a possible citizen revolt. Despite the secretive nature of grand juries, the persistent rejections indicate that jurors may be resisting harsh charges in a highly politicized environment. This is unusual, as grand juries typically approve indictments proposed by prosecutors. Former U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade noted that it is extremely rare for a grand jury to reject an indictment, suggesting that these jurors may be seeing prosecutorial overreach and refusing to participate. The rejections have occurred in at least seven cases, including three times for the same defendant, highlighting a significant shift in the usual dynamics of grand jury proceedings.
