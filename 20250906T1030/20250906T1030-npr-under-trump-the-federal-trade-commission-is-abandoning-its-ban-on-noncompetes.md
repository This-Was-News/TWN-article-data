## Article summary
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under President Trump is moving to abandon its ban on noncompete agreements, reversing a key accomplishment from the Biden administration. Noncompetes are contracts that restrict workers from taking jobs with competitors or starting their own businesses. The ban, championed by former FTC Chair Lina Khan, was finalized in 2024 but never took effect due to a legal challenge. The Trump administration has since paused and now dismissed the appeal, with FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson arguing the ban exceeded the agency's authority. The FTC estimates that 30 million American workers are bound by noncompetes. Business groups opposed the ban, arguing it would harm competition and economic stability. Ferguson, while critical of noncompetes, prefers targeted enforcement over a blanket ban. The FTC plans to focus on enforcing existing laws against abusive noncompetes. Critics argue that enforcement alone is insufficient to protect workers. Rebecca Denton, a former real estate worker, shared her experience feeling trapped by a noncompete agreement. Colorado's recent law limiting noncompetes has helped some workers, but advocates call for a nationwide ban to ensure broad protection.
