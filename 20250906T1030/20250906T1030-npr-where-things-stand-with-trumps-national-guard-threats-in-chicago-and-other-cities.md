## Article summary
Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans are preparing for the potential arrival of National Guard troops, as President Trump has threatened deployment to curb crime. Despite data showing crime has decreased in these cities, Trump has mentioned them as possible locations for troop deployment, following similar actions in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. In Chicago, organizers of a Mexican Independence celebration plan to bolster security with volunteers and distribute 'know your rights' cards. Major events in Chicago will proceed as scheduled, but organizers are monitoring the situation closely. One Mexican Independence Day celebration has been postponed due to concerns about immigration raids and National Guard deployment. Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, encouraged residents to celebrate and expressed no intimidation. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker expects Trump to deploy undercover agents in unmarked vehicles to Latino neighborhoods. In Baltimore, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Mayor Brandon Scott are discussing legal actions against the Trump administration if troops are deployed. Moore criticized the Trump administration for cutting funds for violence prevention programs and announced additional state law enforcement resources for Baltimore. Unlike Democratic governors, Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry supports the prospect of troops in New Orleans. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell's office emphasized progress in reducing crime without explicitly supporting or opposing troop deployment. Shreveport's mayor respected the governor's concerns but advocated for discussions among local, state, and federal officials to identify long-term solutions.
