## Article summary
The U.S. military conducted five lethal kinetic strikes on drug boats in the Caribbean in the final days of 2025, resulting in the deaths of eight individuals. These strikes, approved by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, targeted three vessels on December 30 and two on December 31. The U.S. Southern Command confirmed that these vessels were operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations and were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes. Following the strikes, the U.S. Coast Guard was deployed to search for survivors. This operation is part of President Donald Trump's Joint Task Force Southern Spear, which has also included recent strikes on suspected drug loading sites in Venezuela. Secretary Hegseth hailed 2025 as a historic year for U.S. military operations and indicated that more counter-narcotics operations are planned for 2026.
