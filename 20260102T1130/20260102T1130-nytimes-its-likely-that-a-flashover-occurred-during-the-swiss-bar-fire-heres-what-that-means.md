## Article summary
A fire at the Swiss Bar, Le Constellation, in Crans-Montana, resulted in approximately 40 fatalities. While the investigation is ongoing, authorities suspect a flashover caused the explosion and rapid spread of flames. A flashover is a dangerous phenomenon where a fire in an enclosed space quickly ignites nearly everything simultaneously. This occurs as hot gases rise, increasing temperatures to around 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, causing combustible materials like wood and plastics to ignite. The process can take as little as three to five minutes. Even firefighters in protective gear would struggle to survive such extreme temperatures. Flashovers are common globally and are a feature of many major fires. The 2003 Rhode Island nightclub fire, which killed 100 people, is cited as a similar incident involving a flashover. Fortunately, flashovers are preventable through measures such as sprinkler systems and adherence to fire codes, including avoiding flammable ceiling materials.
