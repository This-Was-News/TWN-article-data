## Article summary
A devastating fire swept through the Le Constellation bar and lounge in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Day, resulting in approximately 40 fatalities and injuring around 115 people. The blaze occurred shortly after midnight as dozens of revelers were celebrating the new year. Many of the victims and injured are reported to be in their teens and early twenties. Survivors described a terrifying scene of smoke, flames, and a desperate struggle to escape the crowded venue. Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris, recounted forcing a window open to flee, while others reported a surge of people trying to exit through narrow stairwells and doors. Witnesses described seeing sparklers on champagne bottles potentially igniting the fire, which quickly spread through the wooden structure. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, with authorities ruling out any attack. The incident has left the community devastated, and international representatives have indicated that their nationals are among the missing. This tragedy marks one of the worst in Switzerland's recent history, drawing comparisons to a fatal bus crash in the region in 2012.
