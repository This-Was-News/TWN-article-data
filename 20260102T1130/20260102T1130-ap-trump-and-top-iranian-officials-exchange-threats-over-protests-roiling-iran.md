## Article summary
President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials have exchanged threats amidst escalating economic protests in Iran. Trump warned on social media that the U.S. would intervene if peaceful protesters were harmed, stating "We are locked and loaded and ready to go." In response, Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, accused the U.S. and Israel of instigating the demonstrations and warned of regional chaos and destruction of U.S. interests if America intervened. Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also issued a warning against intervention. The protests, now in their sixth day, are the largest in Iran since 2022 and were initially sparked by the depreciation of the Iranian rial. Demonstrators have also voiced anti-theocracy chants. The U.S. and Iran's tensions are heightened following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June. Iran had previously stated it was no longer enriching uranium, signaling openness to negotiations, but talks have stalled amid warnings from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding Iran's atomic program.
