## Article summary
Russian authorities claim a Ukrainian drone strike on a New Year's Eve celebration in the occupied village of Khorly, Kherson region, resulted in 27 deaths and 31 injuries, including minors. They have opened a terrorism investigation. However, Kyiv has denied attacking civilian targets, stating that Ukrainian forces target only military and legitimate Russian assets. Ukraine's General Staff spokesperson indicated that strikes on New Year's Eve did not include occupied parts of Kherson. The Associated Press could not independently verify the claims. These accusations follow Moscow's earlier allegations of a drone attack on President Vladimir Putin's residence, which Kyiv also denied as a fabrication to disrupt peace talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously stated that a peace deal was nearly complete, with only difficult issues remaining. Meanwhile, Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on Zaporizhzhia, causing damage but no casualties, according to local officials. Ukraine's Air Force reported intercepting most of the 116 Russian drones fired overnight. Separately, the governor of Russia's Belgorod region accused Ukraine of a missile strike on the city of Belgorod, causing injuries and property damage.
