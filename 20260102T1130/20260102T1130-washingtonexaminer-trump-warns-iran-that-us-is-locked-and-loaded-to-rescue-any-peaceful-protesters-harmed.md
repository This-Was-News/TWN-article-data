## Article summary
President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran on January 2, 2026, stating that the United States is prepared to intervene if the Iranian government harms peaceful protesters. Trump declared on his Truth Social account that the U.S. is "locked and loaded" and ready to "rescue" any individuals subjected to violence. This statement followed reports of protests across Iran stemming from economic hardships and the devaluation of the nation's currency. At least six people were reportedly killed in demonstrations earlier in the week, which are described as the largest since 2022. A deputy governor in Lorestan province confirmed that the protests are driven by economic pressures and livelihood concerns. Trump's warning suggests potential U.S. action against the Iranian government for its "custom" of "violently kill[ing] peaceful protesters."
