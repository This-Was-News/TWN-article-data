## Article summary
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has expressed openness to discussions with the United States regarding drug trafficking, stating that his country is ready for serious talks on the matter. However, Maduro remained silent when questioned about a recent CIA-led drone strike on a Venezuelan docking area suspected of being used by drug cartels. The U.S. government, under President Trump, has been conducting strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats off Venezuela's coast, viewing it as an escalation to combat drug flow into the U.S. Maduro perceives these actions, along with a military deployment to the Caribbean, as an attempt by the U.S. to force a government change and gain access to Venezuela's oil reserves. He indicated that Venezuela is also open to U.S. investment in its oil sector, similar to the existing arrangement with Chevron. The recent drone strike marks a significant escalation, being the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the boat strikes began. Maduro suggested he would address the drone strike in the coming days. The U.S. has charged Maduro with narco-terrorism, while Venezuela claims the U.S. seeks to impose itself through threats and force. The interview was taped on New Year's Eve, the same day the U.S. military announced further boat strikes.
