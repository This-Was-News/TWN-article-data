## Article summary
California has postponed the cancellation of approximately 17,000 commercial truck driver licenses issued to illegal immigrants by 60 days. The California Department of Motor Vehicles announced the delay, which was set to take effect on January 5th. This decision is likely to face opposition from the Trump administration. The delay provides illegal immigrants with an additional two months to reapply for their licenses and retake exams. This action follows new guidance implemented in May by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, requiring English language proficiency for truck drivers to ensure they can read road signs. A previous investigation by the Federal Motor Safety Administration found that California, New Mexico, and Washington failed to enforce these English language requirements. The Trump administration had threatened to withhold federal funding from these states if they did not comply. The California Highway Patrol has indicated it does not plan to follow the federal regulation. The postponement comes amid reports of fatal traffic incidents involving illegal immigrants holding commercial driver licenses, such as a case in Florida where an illegal immigrant driver caused a fatal crash.
