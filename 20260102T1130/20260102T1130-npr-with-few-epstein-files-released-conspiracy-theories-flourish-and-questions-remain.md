## Article summary
The recent release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files has intensified conspiracy theories and eroded public trust, despite the Justice Department's efforts to comply with a congressional mandate. President Trump's past promises to release these files have contrasted with his administration's slow and piecemeal disclosure, leading to criticism from both his supporters and opponents. The released documents, often heavily redacted and disorganized, include unverified claims and forged materials, prompting the Justice Department to issue warnings about the accuracy of the information. While some files mention President Trump's past association with Epstein, he has not been credibly accused of wrongdoing. The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in November, mandated the release of all unclassified records but lacks enforcement mechanisms, leaving Congress considering further action. The ongoing saga, with potentially millions of files yet to be released, continues to fuel political fallout as the 2026 midterm elections approach, impacting even congressional party majorities.
