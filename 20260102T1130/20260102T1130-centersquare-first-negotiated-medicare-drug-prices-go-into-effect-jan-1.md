## Article summary
Negotiated lower Medicare costs for 10 popular prescription drugs have taken effect, a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allows the Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices for the first time. The selected drugs, including Eliquis, Januvia, and insulins like Fiasp and Novolog, are used to treat conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune diseases, blood cancers, and heart failure. These negotiated prices represent significant reductions from the drugs' list prices, with some seeing decreases of up to 79%. For example, the blood thinner Eliquis, widely used by Medicare Part D enrollees, will now have a maximum charge of $231 for a 30-day supply, a 56% reduction from its previous list price. Januvia, used for diabetes, experienced the largest price cut, dropping from $527 to $113 per month. The actual savings passed on to Medicare Part D and Advantage plan enrollees, however, remain uncertain due to the complexity of drug pricing and varying insurance plan coverages. All Part D and applicable Advantage plans are legally required to cover these 10 negotiated drugs. This initiative aims to reduce Medicare spending and ensure the program's long-term financial stability.
