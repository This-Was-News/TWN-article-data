## Article summary
Millions of Americans face increased health insurance costs as Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies have expired. A bipartisan group of senators is working on a compromise to reinstate enhanced ACA premium tax credits, potentially mitigating rising monthly payments for Obamacare enrollees. Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, believes that President Trump's support is crucial for the legislation's passage due to his influence over Republicans. Welch suggests that the compromise could include a two-year extension of the credits, an income cap, copays, and penalties for insurer fraud, aiming for bipartisan support through cost-saving measures. He highlighted the significant premium increases faced by individuals, such as a farmer in Vermont whose monthly cost could jump from $900 to $3,200, and the potential negative impact on rural hospitals losing revenue. Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, a bipartisan effort is also underway, with four House Republicans joining Democrats to sign a discharge petition for a three-year ACA subsidy extension, forcing a floor vote upon their return. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania, expressed his support for the extension, even without an income cap, viewing it as a better alternative to letting the subsidies expire. Fitzpatrick and Representative Tom Suozzi, a Democrat from New York, have been discussing legislative paths with moderate senators. The Senate is set to return on January 5th, followed by the House on January 6th.
