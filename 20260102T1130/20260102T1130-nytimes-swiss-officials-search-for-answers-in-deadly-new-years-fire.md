## Article summary
A devastating fire at the Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski resort town of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve has resulted in approximately 40 deaths and over 100 injuries. The blaze, which broke out early Thursday, is believed to have been exacerbated by a flashover, a rapid spread of fire in an enclosed space that causes nearly everything to ignite simultaneously. Officials are working to identify the victims, many of whom are young adults and international tourists, a process that could take days or weeks due to severe burns. The local hospital was overwhelmed, and burn units across Switzerland are at capacity, leading to victims being transferred to Italy and France for specialized treatment. The bar, a popular casual venue known for its younger clientele and live music, had only one exit in its basement, making escape difficult. The tragedy has sent shockwaves through the close-knit village, with residents mourning the loss and grappling with the uncertainty of identifying loved ones. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but authorities have ruled out an attack, focusing on the possibility of accidental ignition leading to the flashover. This event is being described as one of the worst tragedies in Swiss history, drawing parallels to a similar nightclub fire in Rhode Island in 2003. Efforts are underway to understand the full scope of the disaster and to support the affected families and community.
