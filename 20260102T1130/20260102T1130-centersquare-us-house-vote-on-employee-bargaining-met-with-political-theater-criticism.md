## Article summary
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Protect American Workers Act, a measure that would restore collective bargaining rights for over one million federal workers. U.S. Rep. Eric Sorensen, a Democrat from Illinois, praised the vote, stating that it rescinds a previous executive order and upholds the rights of public servants to organize for fair wages and working conditions. He emphasized that bipartisan support highlights a recognition of the importance of these rights for federal employees. However, critics, such as Maxford Nelsen from the Freedom Foundation, argue that the bill is largely political theater and unlikely to pass the Senate. Nelsen contends that the current system already involves mandatory collective bargaining, which he finds inefficient and less protective of employee rights than often portrayed, noting that wages are typically not subject to such bargaining. He also suggests that some Republican support for the bill is a calculated political move, as they anticipate it will not become law due to the filibuster threshold and a potential presidential veto. Nelsen clarifies that the core issue is not union membership but the principle of mandatory collective bargaining, which grants unions special access and influence over federal agency operations. He contrasts this with the historical role of advocacy groups and argues that unions seek legally binding contracts that dictate minute operational details, a level of control he believes is inappropriate for government unions.
