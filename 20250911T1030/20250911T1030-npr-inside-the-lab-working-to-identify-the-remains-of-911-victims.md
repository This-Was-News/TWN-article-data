## Article summary
A team at the Charles S. Hirsch Center for Forensic Sciences in New York City is working to identify the remains of 9/11 victims. Despite 24 years passing, 40% of the 2,753 victims have not had their remains identified. The team, led by Mark Desre, uses advanced DNA technology to test and identify remains, often re-examining samples as technology improves. The harsh conditions at Ground Zero, including extreme heat and exposure to chemicals, have made the process challenging. The office has tested all 21,905 remains recovered, but some remain unidentified due to highly degraded DNA. The team also collects DNA samples from victims' relatives to aid in identification. Dr. Jason Graham, the chief medical examiner, emphasizes the office's commitment to identifying all remains. Families of the victims express gratitude for the ongoing efforts, with some finding comfort in the identification process. The work is deeply personal for some team members, including Desre, who was present during the attacks.
