## Article summary
Israel has conducted a series of targeted attacks across the Middle East, aiming to eliminate key leaders of militant groups and Iran. Recent strikes in Qatar failed to kill Hamas leaders, but Israel's campaign has targeted figures in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Yemen, and Qatar. Notable killings include Hamas leaders like Mohammed Def, Mohammed Snwar, and Ismail Hanyeh, as well as Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. These actions have led to temporary ceasefires in Lebanon and Iran but have not ended conflicts in Gaza and Yemen. Israel's strikes have also targeted Iranian officials, leading to a direct war with Iran in 2025. Despite these efforts, Hamas and other groups continue to operate, and analysts predict further conflict. Israel's defense minister has warned that attacks on Israel will be met with severe retaliation. The ongoing violence highlights the complex and enduring nature of regional tensions.
