## Article summary
A manhunt is underway for the shooter who killed Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, during a speech at Utah Valley University. Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and ally of President Trump, was shot while addressing students. Authorities described the attack as a political assassination, with some blaming radical left rhetoric. Video evidence suggests the shooter fired from a rooftop over 100 yards away. The FBI initially claimed a suspect was in custody but later backtracked, releasing the person and continuing the investigation. Kirk was known for his strong support of gun rights, opposition to LGBTQ+ rights, and endorsement of the Great Replacement Theory. His death has been met with shock and grief among conservative Christians, who view him as a martyr. The incident has intensified concerns about political violence and polarization in the U.S., with calls for unity and condemnation of such acts from both sides of the political spectrum.
