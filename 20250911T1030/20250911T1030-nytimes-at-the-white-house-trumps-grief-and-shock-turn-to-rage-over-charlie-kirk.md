## Article summary
President Trump was informed about the shooting of Charlie Kirk, a conservative influencer and close ally, while speaking at a Utah college. Initially shocked, Trump later expressed fury in a video address, blaming the radical left's rhetoric for the killing. Kirk, known for galvanizing young conservatives, was close to Trump and his inner circle. Trump's video mentioned the radical left's comparisons of people like Kirk to Nazis and mass murderers, which he deemed responsible for terrorism in the country. The White House staff reacted with quiet and tears as they absorbed the news. Trump signed a proclamation lowering flags to half-staff in Kirk's honor and was still planning a visit to New York on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
