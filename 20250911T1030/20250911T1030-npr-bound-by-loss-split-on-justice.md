## Article summary
Twenty-four years after the 9/11 attacks, Elizabeth Mller and Brett Eagleson, who both lost their fathers in the tragedy, reflect on their shared loss and differing views on justice. Mller, now 30, remembers her firefighter father, Douglas, as devoted and playful, while Eagleson, now 39, recalls his father, Bruce, as energetic and caring. The men accused of planning the attacks, including Khald Shekh Mohammed, have not yet faced trial due to legal complexities arising from their torture in secret CIA prisons. The case remains in legal limbo, with the defendants held at Guantánamo Bay. Mller and Eagleson have become advocates for 9/11 victims' families, but they differ on how to resolve the case. Mller supported plea agreements that would have avoided a trial, while Eagleson opposed them, believing a trial is necessary to uncover the truth. Both express frustration with the government's handling of the case and the lack of closure. They agree that the advocacy work has been mentally taxing and has kept old wounds open. Despite their differences, they both wish for a resolution that brings justice and closure to the families of the nearly 3,000 victims.
