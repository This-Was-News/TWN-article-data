## Article summary
Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump and CEO of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed at Utah Valley University during a campus event. The shooting, described by Utah Governor Spencer Cox as a political assassination, occurred on Wednesday, September 10, 2025. Authorities are still searching for the unidentified shooter, who fired from a rooftop and fled the scene. The incident has drawn bipartisan condemnation and highlighted the escalating threat of political violence in the United States. Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by Turning Point USA when he was shot, with videos showing the moment he was struck. The event was part of Kirk's 'The American Comeback Tour,' which had sparked controversy on campus. Trump praised Kirk as a 'martyr for truth and freedom' and blamed the 'rhetoric of the radical left' for the killing. The university was evacuated and closed until Monday, with law enforcement actively investigating the crime.
