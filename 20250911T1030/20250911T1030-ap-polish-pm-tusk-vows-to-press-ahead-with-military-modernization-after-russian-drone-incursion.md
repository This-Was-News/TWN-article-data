## Article summary
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has vowed to continue with a significant military modernization program following a Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace. The incident, described as a deliberate provocation by European officials, has heightened tensions and raised concerns about a broader conflict. Poland has introduced air traffic restrictions and closed its border with Belarus, where Russian and Belarusian troops are preparing for war games. Tusk praised the quick response of Polish and NATO forces, including those from the Netherlands. The incident has sparked questions about the use of advanced fighter jets to shoot down relatively cheap drones. Poland expects to receive its first F-35 fighter jets from the United States next year. Polish President Karol Nawrocki visited a military air base, asserting that Poland is not intimidated by Russian drones. The European Council on Foreign Relations suggested that Russia is testing Europe's resolve. U.S. President Donald Trump's response to the incident was ambiguous, while several European leaders believed the incursion was intentional. Russian drone attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine are daily occurrences, and the Ukrainian military has developed drones to combat these attacks. The war has accelerated the development of high-tech drone technology.
