## Article summary
The graphic video of conservative activist Charles Kirk's assassination was widely available online, highlighting the changing role of media gatekeepers in the age of social media. Traditional news organizations were cautious in their coverage, avoiding explicit imagery, but this had little impact as gruesome footage spread rapidly across platforms like X, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and even Truth Social. The event, which took place at a public event in Utah, was captured from multiple angles and speeds, with millions of people viewing the footage. Social media platforms struggled with the ethical implications of sharing such graphic content, with some implementing age restrictions and warnings. Traditional media's cautious approach seemed outdated in the face of instant, unfiltered content dissemination. The availability of shocking images risked exacerbating societal divisions and pain, with some expressing concern about the nation's ability to heal from such events.
