## Article summary
Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot at an event at Utah Valley University. Kirk, a prominent conservative figure and ally of former President Donald Trump, was speaking at a debate hosted by his organization when he was shot from a roof. Videos show the moment he was struck, with a single shot hitting him in the neck. Utah authorities confirmed the shooter targeted Kirk specifically. A person of interest was taken into custody, though no charges were immediately announced. The university was evacuated and remained closed, with classes canceled. Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012, which became a prominent conservative youth organization, particularly after aligning with Trump. Kirk was known for his provocative statements and opposition to policies like Juneteenth. Both Republicans and Democrats condemned the attack, with Trump ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff and describing Kirk as a great guy.
