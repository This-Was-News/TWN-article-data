## Article summary
Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump urged both Ukraine and Russia to halt their military operations and end the war, suggesting that each side should claim victory and let history decide the outcome. Trump's stance has fluctuated, previously expressing support for Ukraine's efforts to reclaim lost territory but now leaning towards a ceasefire. Zelenskyy, while agreeing on the need for a ceasefire, avoided directly addressing Trump's suggestion that Ukraine concede land. Trump also indicated reluctance to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles and expressing a preference for ending the war. Zelenskyy had proposed a deal involving advanced Ukrainian drones in exchange for the Tomahawks, which he believes could significantly aid Ukraine's defense. Trump's recent interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin have influenced his approach, with Putin warning against supplying the missiles. Despite Trump's efforts to mediate, Putin has shown no interest in direct talks with Zelenskyy, and the conflict continues to escalate.
