## Article summary
Senator Tim Kaine is leading a bipartisan effort to force a Senate vote to prevent President Trump from unilaterally declaring war on Venezuela. The move comes amid increased U.S. military activity in the Caribbean and covert operations in Venezuela. Kaine, along with Senators Adam Schiff and Rand Paul, filed a resolution to ensure congressional approval before any military action. Concerns about an imminent conflict are growing due to recent military strikes and covert operations authorized by Trump. The administration has conducted several strikes on alleged drug boats, resulting in at least 27 deaths, but has not provided evidence to justify these actions. Kaine and other lawmakers view these strikes as illegal and unconstitutional. A previous vote to limit Trump's war powers in the region failed, but the senators hope more Republicans will support the new resolution. The administration has not shared sufficient information about its actions in Venezuela, leaving Congress in the dark. Trump has hinted at potential land operations in Venezuela, further escalating tensions.
