## Article summary
On Saturday, millions of protesters are expected to participate in No Kings marches across the U.S. to oppose President Trump's policies, which the movement claims are more aligned with a monarch than an elected official. This will be the second major wave of protests organized by No Kings, a network of progressive groups. The first protests in June were a response to a military parade held on the Army's 250th anniversary, which critics saw as a display of Trump's vanity. The upcoming protests aim to address issues such as immigration detentions, cuts to education and environmental protections, and gerrymandering. Organizers anticipate even larger turnout than the previous event, which drew over 5 million people. Despite criticism from Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, the protests are expected to remain peaceful. Some Republican governors, like Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Greg Abbott of Texas, have mobilized National Guards in preparation. The lead organizer in Connecticut, Jim Chapdelaine, emphasized the importance of peaceful protest and community building.
