## Article summary
Prince Andrew, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II, has faced numerous scandals that have strained his relationship with the royal family for over four decades. His actions have led to embarrassing headlines, legal issues, and suspicions of using his royal status for personal benefit. Notable incidents include spraying reporters with paint in 1984, selling his house to a controversial figure in 2007, and his ex-wife's attempt to sell access to him in 2010. Andrew's association with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, has been particularly damaging, leading to his resignation as Britain's special trade envoy in 2011 and a disastrous BBC interview in 2019. He was stripped of his royal duties in 2020 and settled a lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre in 2022, who alleged sexual abuse. Recent revelations about his ties to a suspected Chinese spy and emails to Epstein further tarnished his reputation, ultimately leading to the loss of his remaining royal titles.
