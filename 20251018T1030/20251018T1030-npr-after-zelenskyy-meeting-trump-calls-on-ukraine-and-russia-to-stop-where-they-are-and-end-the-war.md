## Article summary
President Donald Trump, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urged both Ukraine and Russia to halt their military actions and end the war. Trump suggested that both sides should stop where they are and declare victory, with history deciding the outcome. This stance marks a shift from his previous support for Ukraine's efforts to retake lost territory. Zelenskyy, while agreeing on the need for a ceasefire, avoided commenting directly on Trump's suggestion for Ukraine to give up land. Trump also indicated he might not sell Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles. Zelenskyy had proposed a deal involving Ukraine's advanced drones in exchange for the missiles, which he believes could be crucial in compelling Russia to negotiate. Trump's position on the missiles shifted after a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who warned against supplying the Tomahawks. The meeting was the fifth between Trump and Zelenskyy since Trump's return to office, with Trump suggesting a potential double meeting with both leaders in Hungary to facilitate negotiations.
