## Article summary
Israel has identified the remains of Eliyahu Margalit, a 76-year-old hostage abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Margalit's body was found in Khan Younis and identified through forensic testing. He is the 10th hostage body returned since the ceasefire began over a week ago. Hamas has handed over 11 bodies in total, but only 10 were hostages. The hostage forum, supporting the families of those abducted, continues to demand the return of the remaining 18 hostages. The ceasefire agreement includes the handover of bodies, aid deliveries, and the opening of border crossings into Gaza. Hamas accuses Israel of violating the ceasefire and continuing attacks, while Israel maintains control over half of Gaza. The flow of aid into Gaza remains constrained, with only 339 trucks offloaded in the past week, far below the agreed 600 trucks per day. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, with famine declared in Gaza City and over 400 deaths from malnutrition-related causes. Israel's campaign in Gaza has resulted in nearly 68,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
