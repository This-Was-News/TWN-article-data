## Article summary
Indiana University recently fired Jim Rodenbush, the faculty adviser of its student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student, after he refused to block news stories from a homecoming edition. The university had been pressuring the paper to eliminate news content from its print editions, which were already reduced to seven special editions per semester. Rodenbush's dismissal sparked outrage from advocates for student media and prominent supporters, including Mark Cuban, who criticized the university for interfering with the newspaper's independence. The university claims it wants to shift resources to digital platforms and address financial issues, but the move has raised questions about censorship and First Amendment rights. The newspaper continues to publish online, covering controversial topics such as campus sexual assaults and allegations against university officials. Legal experts argue that student editors at public universities should determine content, and the university's actions have been deemed inappropriate by many.
