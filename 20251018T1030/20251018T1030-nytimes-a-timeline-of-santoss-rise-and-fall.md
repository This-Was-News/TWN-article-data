## Article summary
A Timeline of George Santos’s Rise and Fall chronicles the meteoric rise and subsequent downfall of George Santos, a former congressman whose fabricated credentials and criminal activities led to his expulsion from Congress and imprisonment. Santos initially presented himself as a successful Republican candidate with impressive Wall Street credentials and personal connections to national tragedies. However, it was soon revealed that much of his background was fabricated, leading to a series of investigations and legal troubles. Santos was indicted on multiple charges, including wire fraud and identity theft, and eventually pleaded guilty. Despite his attempts to capitalize on his notoriety, Santos was sentenced to over seven years in prison. His sentence was later commuted by President Trump, who cited concerns over the harsh conditions of Santos's imprisonment.
