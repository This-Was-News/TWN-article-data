## Article summary
George Santos, the former New York Republican representative known for fabricating his résumé, was released from federal prison on Friday night. President Trump commuted Santos's seven-year sentence for fraud, citing political factors and the harsh conditions Santos faced in prison. Santos's lawyer, Joseph Murray, confirmed the release, stating that a great injustice had been corrected. Trump's decision was influenced by Santos's regular columns in a Long Island newspaper, where he detailed his prison experiences. Santos, 37, had been incarcerated since July after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, serving less than three months of his 87-month sentence. The release came after extensive media coverage of Santos's deceptions since 2022. Trump's social media post highlighted his belief that Santos's sentence was disproportionate to his crimes and praised Santos for sharing his views. The president also mentioned Santos's mistreatment in prison, including long stretches in solitary confinement. The decision to commute Santos's sentence was framed as a correction of an injustice, with Trump wishing Santos a good life moving forward.
