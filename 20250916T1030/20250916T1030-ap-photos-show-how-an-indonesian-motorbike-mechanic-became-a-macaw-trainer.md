## Article summary
Alb Albar Raml, a former motorbike mechanic from Depok, Indonesia, has transformed his life into a macaw trainer, inspired by his passion for birds. Starting with small parakeets in 2018, he soon dreamed of caring for larger, more elegant species like macaws. In 2020, he began his journey with Zoro, his first macaw, and now cares for 18 macaws in his home. Raml trains the macaws to fly and return on command, preparing them for competitions. He knows each bird's personality and ensures they are well-groomed and healthy. Raml participates in competitions not just to win but to showcase his dedication and the results of his daily care. He accepts whatever payment the macaw owners are willing to give, driven by his love for the birds and the pride in caring for expensive species. His journey highlights his deep connection with the macaws and his commitment to their well-being.
