## Article summary
The Senate confirmed Stephen Miran as a Federal Reserve governor, allowing him to vote on interest rates during the upcoming Fed meeting. Miran, a top economic adviser to President Trump, was approved despite Democratic concerns about his independence from the White House. Republicans expedited his confirmation, changing Senate rules to facilitate Trump's nominees. Miran plans to take a leave from his White House role but intends to return, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Critics worry his ties to Trump could influence his Fed decisions, potentially compromising the central bank's independence. Miran has been critical of the Fed and its policies, aligning with Trump's views on inflation and tariffs. He previously advocated for weakening the dollar to boost American competitiveness. Miran's confirmation comes amid Trump's broader effort to reshape the Fed, including attempts to remove Fed member Lisa Cook. Senator Lisa Murkowski was the only Republican to vote against Miran, citing concerns about appearances of independence. Miran's background includes roles at the Treasury Department and a hedge fund, as well as authoring a controversial report advocating for a weaker dollar.
