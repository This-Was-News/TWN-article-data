## Article summary
Israel's military has launched a ground offensive in Gaza City, urging residents to evacuate southward. The operation marks another escalation in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, with no clear timeline for completion. Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, declared that Gaza is 'burning,' while the UN Human Rights Council accused Israel of committing genocide, a claim Israel vehemently denies. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Qatar, emphasizing the urgency of a negotiated settlement. Arab and Muslim nations condemned Israel's recent strike in Qatar but stopped short of major action. Egypt escalated its rhetoric against Israel, referring to it as an enemy for the first time in years. The Israeli military aims to control most of the Gaza Strip, with heavy strikes reported in Gaza City. Palestinian casualties continue to rise, with hospitals overwhelmed by the influx of wounded. Families of hostages held in Gaza protested outside Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence, demanding an end to the operation. The war began in October 2023 after a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, leading to a devastating Israeli retaliatory offensive. Egypt, a key mediator, appears to be losing patience with Israel's actions, signaling serious concern over recent developments.
