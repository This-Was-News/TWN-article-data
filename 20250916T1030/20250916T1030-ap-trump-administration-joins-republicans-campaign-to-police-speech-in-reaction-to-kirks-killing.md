## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance and the Trump administration have joined Republicans in demanding consequences for those who have celebrated the killing of conservative figure Charles Kirk. Vance urged the public to call out and report individuals who make distasteful comments about Kirk's assassination, including targeting their employers. This campaign has escalated, with some comparing it to McCarthyism, and has led to investigations of teachers and military personnel for inappropriate statements. The Trump administration is also targeting liberal funders and organizations, even as authorities maintain that the shooter acted alone. Critics warn that this campaign is creating a chilling effect and targeting individuals for simply quoting Kirk or not mourning him adequately. Conservatives have co-opted the term 'cancel culture' to describe what they see as persecution of their views. Meanwhile, Democrats have condemned Kirk's murder and pointed out that they have also been victims of political violence. Concerns have been raised about the government using this tragedy to punish political opponents.
