## Article summary
A federal appeals court ruled that Lisa Cook can remain on the Federal Reserve board and participate in a crucial two-day meeting to set interest rates, marking the second legal defeat for President Trump in his attempt to remove her. The court upheld a lower judge's decision to temporarily block Trump from firing Cook, citing the risks and potential market disruption if she were removed. Cook's lawyers argued that her dismissal could destabilize financial markets and the politically independent central bank. The judges noted that granting the government's request for emergency relief would upend the status quo. Cook's defense included the claim that she was not given adequate time to respond to the allegations before Trump tried to remove her, an argument the judges found strong. Trump and his administration have accused Cook of mortgage fraud, but she has not been charged with any crime. A preliminary loan estimate reviewed by The New York Times suggests Cook did not deceive lenders about a property she purchased before joining the Fed, complicating the administration's claims. The law allows the president to dismiss Fed officials only for cause, such as professional neglect or malfeasance, which the court ruled Trump had not met. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
