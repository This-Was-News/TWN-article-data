## Article summary
FBI Director Kash Patel is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee amid growing scrutiny over his leadership. Patel, a loyalist of President Trump, lacks experience leading a large organization like the FBI. He has faced criticism for his social media posts and actions during the manhunt for the killer of conservative activist Charles Kirk. Three former senior FBI officials have sued Patel, alleging they were fired for improper political reasons. Despite these challenges, Patel has the support of President Trump, who praised the FBI's quick capture of the suspected Kirk gunman, Tyler Robinson. Patel defended his decision to release enhanced photos and videos of the suspect, which he claims led to the arrest. However, former FBI officials argue that Patel's use of social media was inappropriate and premature. The lawsuit against Patel alleges that he fired agents to curry favor with the White House, undermining national security. Patel has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that his actions were transparent and in the public's interest.
