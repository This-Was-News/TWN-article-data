## Article summary
A federal vaccine advisory panel, recently overhauled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is expected to vote on delaying the hepatitis B vaccine for children until age 4, a change from the current practice of administering it at birth. The vote is scheduled for September 18-19 during the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting. Pediatricians warn that delaying the vaccine could increase the risk of children contracting the virus, which can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer. The panel will also discuss recommendations for other vaccines, including measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and COVID-19. Critics argue that the process lacks typical data analysis and transparency, with concerns raised about the potential impact on insurance coverage and access to vaccines. The change could leave parents to pay out of pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided for free. The CDC's current recommendation, in place for over 30 years, has significantly reduced hepatitis B cases among children. Health experts emphasize the importance of early vaccination to prevent chronic infections and long-term health complications.
