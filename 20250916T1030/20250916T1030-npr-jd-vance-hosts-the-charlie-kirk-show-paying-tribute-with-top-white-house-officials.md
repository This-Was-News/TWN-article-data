## Article summary
Vice President JD Vance hosted an episode of 'The Charlie Kirk Show' on Monday, five days after Kirk was shot and killed in Utah. The two-hour livestream featured key Trump administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy. Vance and others reflected on Kirk's legacy and discussed sustaining the movement he built over the past 13 years. The episode was marked by a sense of loss and anger, with Vance arguing that criticism of Kirk from the left stoked violence against him. Vance criticized the 'far-left' movement and omitted recent acts of violence targeting Democrats. He announced plans to target NGOs and organized cells involved in violence. Vance and Miller emphasized using government resources to dismantle these networks. Vance urged the audience to honor Kirk by shining the light of truth. Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012, which has grown significantly and seen increased interest since his death. Young conservatives credit Kirk and Turning Point USA for shaping their political beliefs. The future of Turning Point USA remains uncertain, but Susie Wiles suggested Vance and Donald Trump Jr. will remain leading figures in the movement.
