## Article summary
President Donald Trump filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and four of its journalists in U.S. District Court in Florida. The lawsuit targets several articles and a book written by the publication's journalists, alleging a decades-long pattern of intentional and malicious defamation against Trump. The lawsuit claims that the defendants published false statements negligently, with knowledge of their falsity, or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a Truth Social post, Trump accused The New York Times of lying about him and acting as a mouthpiece for the Radical Left Democrat Party. This lawsuit follows another $10 billion defamation lawsuit Trump filed against The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch in July, after the newspaper reported on his ties to wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein.
