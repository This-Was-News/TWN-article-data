## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military targeted a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing three individuals aboard. He claimed the strike occurred in international waters and that the vessel was transporting illegal narcotics, posing a threat to U.S. national security. This strike follows another military action two weeks prior that killed 11 people on a similar vessel. Trump suggested that future strikes could target drug smugglers on land as well. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed this stance, warning cartels of further U.S. military action. Critics, including Senator Adam Schiff, have questioned the legality of these strikes, viewing them as potential overreaches of executive authority. Human rights groups have also raised concerns about the legality of these operations. The Trump administration justifies the strikes as necessary to combat drug trafficking, while Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accused the U.S. of using drug allegations as a pretext for military intimidation and regime change. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated the U.S. stance against Maduro, depicting Venezuela as a drug cartel masquerading as a government.
