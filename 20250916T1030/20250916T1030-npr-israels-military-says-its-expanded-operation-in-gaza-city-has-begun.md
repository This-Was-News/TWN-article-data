## Article summary
Israel's military has begun an expanded operation in Gaza City, aiming to destroy Hamas' military infrastructure, following heavy airstrikes. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that 'Gaza is burning,' escalating the Israel-Hamas war. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Qatar to discuss the crisis, as diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire seem to be faltering. Arab and Muslim nations condemned Israel's recent strike in Qatar but refrained from major actions. Egypt escalated its rhetoric against Israel, referring to it as the 'enemy' for the first time in years. Rubio warned that the window for a negotiated settlement is closing, emphasizing the urgency of ending the conflict. Over 220,000 Palestinians have fled northern Gaza, with heavy strikes reported in Gaza City, resulting in numerous casualties. Families of hostages held in Gaza protested outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence, demanding their release. The war began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in October 2023, leading to significant casualties and hostage situations. Israel's retaliatory offensive has resulted in a high death toll in Gaza, with women and children making up around half of the victims. Egypt's shifting stance signals growing tensions with Israel, as it seeks to address the escalating conflict.
