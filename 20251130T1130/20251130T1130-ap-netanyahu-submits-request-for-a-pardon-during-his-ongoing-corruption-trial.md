## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formally requested a presidential pardon amid his ongoing corruption trial. The prime minister's office confirmed the submission of the request to the Office of the President. The presidents office acknowledged the request as extraordinary and noted its significant implications. Netanyahu is the first sitting prime minister in Israeli history to face trial, charged with fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in three separate cases. He maintains his innocence and has not been convicted of any wrongdoing. The request follows urging from U.S. President Donald Trump for Israel to pardon Netanyahu. In a statement, Netanyahu argued that the trial has divided the nation and that a pardon would foster national unity. He also cited the frequent court appearances as a hindrance to his ability to govern effectively. The pardon request involves two documents, one from his lawyer and one signed by Netanyahu himself. These documents will undergo review by the justice ministry and the Legal Advisor in the Office of the President before a final decision is made by the president.
