## Article summary
During a federal government shutdown, uncertainty surrounding SNAP payments caused significant anxiety for recipients, particularly in Native American communities where food insecurity is disproportionately high. Many relied on tribal commodity food programs as a fallback. Mary Lefthand, a SNAP recipient, switched to the tribal program to ensure food for her grandchildren when SNAP payments were threatened. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes' commodity program saw an influx of applications. Other tribes, like the Blackfeet Nation, resorted to emergency measures like slaughtering buffalo to feed their communities. Nonprofits also diverted funds to provide food aid. These efforts, while crucial, came at a cost to tribal programs, which will not be reimbursed for extra expenses. The disruption to SNAP, even temporarily, can have cascading financial consequences for families, potentially leading to missed rent payments or difficult choices between food and medication. While SNAP has resumed regular payments, the financial strain on tribal communities may persist. Mary Lefthand plans to remain on the commodity program for a while, noting the bureaucratic process required to re-enroll in SNAP after leaving the tribal program.
