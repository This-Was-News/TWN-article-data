## Article summary
Tom Stoppard, the celebrated playwright and screenwriter, has passed away at the age of 88. Renowned for his witty and intellectually stimulating works, Stoppard's career spanned over five decades, earning him numerous accolades, including five Tony Awards. His notable plays include "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," "Arcadia," and "The Coast of Utopia." He also penned acclaimed screenplays for films such as "Brazil" and the Oscar-winning "Shakespeare in Love." Despite the intellectual depth of his work, Stoppard maintained that his plays were fundamentally about people, not abstract concepts. Born Tomáš Sträussler in Czechoslovakia, he and his family fled the Nazis, eventually settling in England, where he assimilated and did not learn of his Jewish heritage until later in life. Stoppard began his career in journalism before transitioning to theater criticism and ultimately becoming a highly influential playwright. He viewed theater as a popular art form and considered himself an entertainer. The term "Stoppardian" even entered the Oxford English Dictionary, signifying his unique style of elegant wit and philosophical exploration. King Charles III expressed his deep sadness, remembering Stoppard as a "dear friend who wore his genius lightly."
