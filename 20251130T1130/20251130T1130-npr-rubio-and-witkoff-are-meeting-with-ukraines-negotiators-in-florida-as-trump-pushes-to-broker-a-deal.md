## Article summary
Top Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, are meeting with Ukrainian negotiators in Florida this weekend. This meeting aims to broker an end to Russia's war in Ukraine and precedes planned talks in Moscow with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The discussions come at a critical time for Ukraine, which is defending against ongoing Russian invasions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently announced the resignation of his chief negotiator, Andrii Yermak, following an investigation into corruption allegations. Rubio had previously met with Yermak in Geneva to discuss a revised peace plan. The current Ukrainian delegation includes high-ranking military and security officials. The focus is on revisions to a 28-point plan initially proposed by Trump, which was criticized for favoring Russian demands, including territorial concessions and military limitations for Ukraine. Trump has since characterized the plan as a flexible "concept." This peace initiative is being spearheaded by individuals known for their real estate backgrounds, emphasizing dealmaking. President Zelenskyy expressed optimism about the constructive approach from the American side, hoping for swift steps to end the war. Meanwhile, Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine, with recent drone and missile strikes causing casualties in Kyiv and surrounding regions. Kazakhstan has urged Ukraine to cease attacks on a major oil terminal near Novorossiysk, highlighting the potential impact on international relations and energy exports.
