## Article summary
Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, has been convicted of drug trafficking and weapons charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison. During his trial, evidence and testimony revealed how he orchestrated a vast trafficking conspiracy that brought millions to cartels while perpetuating poverty, violence, and corruption in Honduras. He accepted a $1 million bribe from El Chapo to allow cocaine shipments through the country and was implicated in a murder to protect him. Despite his conviction, President Trump announced plans to pardon Hernández, calling him a victim of political persecution, a move that has been met with surprise given the evidence presented in court. The trial offered a stark look into a narcostate, with details of large sums of cash, a personalized machine gun, and bribes from drug lords. Hondurans celebrated his conviction outside the Manhattan federal courthouse, highlighting the impact of his actions on their country. This case has been compared in scope to the trial of former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
