## Article summary
Hamas's statement on Friday sparked optimism for an end to the war in Gaza, as it agreed to release all Israeli hostages and bodies of the deceased, aligning with parts of President Trump's peace plan. However, key ambiguities remain, including the timetable for hostage release, Hamas's disarmament, and its future political role in Gaza. President Trump hailed the development, demanding Israel halt bombings to facilitate hostage evacuation, while Israel prepared to implement the plan's first stage. International leaders, including Britain's Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron, praised Hamas's response as a significant step toward peace. Despite past failed cease-fires and fundamental disputes, Hamas's willingness to release hostages has raised hopes for a lasting agreement.
