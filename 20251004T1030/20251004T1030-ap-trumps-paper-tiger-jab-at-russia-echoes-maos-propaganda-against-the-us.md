## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been exchanging barbs, with Trump calling Russia a 'paper tiger' and Putin retorting that NATO is the paper tiger. The phrase 'paper tiger' originates from Mao Zedong's propaganda against the U.S. during the Cold War, referring to something seemingly powerful but actually fragile. The term became a staple in Chinese Communist Party rhetoric, often used to describe Western imperialists. The phrase resurfaced in recent years as U.S.-China relations soured, with Chinese officials using it to dismiss U.S. threats. Trump's use of the term to mock Russia has drawn attention to its historical and political significance. The phrase has also been used in U.S. public discourse to criticize Trump's foreign policy and leadership. The exchange between Trump and Putin highlights the ongoing tensions and propaganda strategies between global powers.
