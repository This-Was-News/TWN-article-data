## Article summary
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Israel's readiness to cooperate with President Trump's plan to end the war with Hamas, following Hamas's statement that it would release all Israeli hostages. The turn of events, sparked by Trump's ultimatum and Hamas's qualified acceptance, offers hope for ending the devastating conflict. Hamas agreed to release hostages in exchange for Israel freeing 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 others detained since the war began. However, Hamas set conditions for the exchange and did not directly address demands for disarmament or its exclusion from future governance. Netanyahu's office responded cautiously, agreeing to hostage release but not addressing Hamas's conditions. Israel's military is preparing for the first phase of the Trump plan, emphasizing readiness to neutralize threats. The future of Gaza and Palestinian rights remain subjects for further discussion within a broader Palestinian framework. The situation remains uncertain, with no immediate concrete steps announced.
