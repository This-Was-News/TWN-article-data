## Article summary
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discusses the federal government shutdown, blaming Democrats for the impasse. She emphasizes the need to cut government spending and reopen the government before addressing other issues, including Affordable Care Act subsidies. Leavitt argues that Democrats are prioritizing health care funding over keeping the government open, which has led to furloughs and unpaid federal workers. She mentions that the White House is considering layoffs and cutting non-essential agencies to save money. Leavitt also defends the administration's decision to halt an infrastructure project in New York, attributing it to the shutdown caused by Democratic leadership. She insists that discussions on health care and other topics can continue once the government is reopened. The interview highlights the political standoff and the administration's strategy to negotiate with moderate Democrats to end the shutdown.
