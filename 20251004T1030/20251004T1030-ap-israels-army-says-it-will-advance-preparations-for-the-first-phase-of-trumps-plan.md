## Article summary
Israel's army is advancing preparations for the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza and return remaining hostages, following Hamas' partial acceptance of the deal. Israel has moved to a defensive-only position in Gaza but has not removed any forces. Trump ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza after Hamas accepted parts of his plan, expressing hope for lasting peace. The plan aims to release 48 hostages, with 20 believed alive, in exchange for Israel halting its offensive, withdrawing from much of Gaza, and releasing Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has agreed to release hostages and hand over power but requires further consultations on other aspects. The plan also includes humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction for Gaza. Despite progress, questions remain about Hamas' willingness to disarm and the practical implementation of the deal. Israeli troops continue to besiege Gaza City, which has slid into famine. Families of hostages are cautiously hopeful, trusting Trump to see the process through.
