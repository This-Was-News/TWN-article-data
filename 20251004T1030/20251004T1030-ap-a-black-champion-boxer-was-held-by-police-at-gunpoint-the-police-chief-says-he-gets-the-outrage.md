## Article summary
The police chief of Omaha, Nebraska, acknowledged that Black people are more likely to be pulled out of their cars at gunpoint by police nationwide. This admission comes after champion boxer Terence Bud Crawford, who is Black, was ordered out of his car at gunpoint hours after a city celebration in his honor. The incident has reignited tensions between Omaha's Black community and its police force. Senator Terrell McKinney criticized the police stop and urged the community to demand real change. A 2022 report showed that Black and Hispanic people were more likely to experience police force than white people. Police Chief Tobb Schmaderer, an advocate of community policing, stated that the officers involved did not violate department policy. Crawford's car was stopped for speeding, and officers discovered legal firearms inside. Crawford and his passengers were handcuffed briefly before being released. Crawford's spokesperson declined to comment, and the police chief stated that video footage of the stop would not be released without Crawford's consent. The incident occurred after a parade and party celebrating Crawford's birthday and recent boxing victory.
