## Article summary
Apple and Google removed apps that alert people to nearby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents following pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi. Apple removed the app ICEBlock, which provided early warnings about ICE sightings, after Bondi's demand. The app's developer, Joshua Aaron, criticized Apple's decision, arguing the app's service was a form of protected speech. Legal experts condemned the move, viewing it as government censorship through intimidation, a practice known as jawboning. Conservatives have previously accused the Biden administration of similar tactics. Apple's action has reignited debates about free expression and government influence over tech companies. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been seen as ingratiating himself with President Trump, who has exempted smartphones from tariffs. Legal experts believe Apple's compliance sets a dangerous precedent and may encourage further government demands.
