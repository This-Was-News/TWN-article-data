## Article summary
A controversial statue depicting President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands has returned to the National Mall after being abruptly removed. The statue, initially titled *Best Friends Forever* and later renamed *Why Can't We Be Friends?*, was installed by the group The Secret Handshake. It was removed by U.S. Park Police for not complying with the permit, but the group repaired and reinstalled it. The statue's return has sparked discussions about Trump's relationship with Epstein and the administration's handling of the 'Epstein files.' The group behind the statue has faced permit issues and released 3D-printable versions online. The Trump administration is under pressure to release the Epstein files, with a recent poll showing majority disapproval of Trump's handling of the matter.
