## Article summary
During a meeting between President Donald Trump and congressional leaders to prevent a government shutdown, Trump 2028 hats appeared on his desk, adding a theatrical element to the serious discussion. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries joked with Vice President JD Vance about the hats, highlighting the unusual tone of the meeting. The meeting, which was the first of its kind for Trump's presidency, failed to produce a deal to avert the shutdown. Democrats discussed health care funding and subsidies, while Republicans focused on a rural hospital fund. Despite the lack of progress, both sides acknowledged the importance of the discussion. Republicans criticized Democrats' claims that Trump was unaware of health care issues. Post-meeting, Trump's team posted a controversial video featuring Jeffries in a sombrero, which was widely condemned. Jeffries emphasized the need for serious bipartisan efforts to fund the government, criticizing Trump's subsequent behavior. The meeting underscored the challenges of bipartisan compromise in Washington.
