## Article summary
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is currently down to two members, leaving it without the required quorum of four to perform its core functions. Republican Trey Trainor's resignation has exacerbated the situation, following the departures of Allen Dickerson and the firing of Democrat Ellen Weintraub by President Trump. The FEC has been unable to issue penalties, start investigations, or issue rules due to the lack of a quorum. While some day-to-day functions continue, such as maintaining the database of campaign finances, the agency's policy work is at a standstill. The White House's hostility towards independent agencies and Trump's efforts to rein in their authority have contributed to the prolonged period without a quorum. The absence of Republican commissioners also means there is no spokesperson for the party on campaign finance matters. Critics argue that the FEC has historically been ineffective in regulating campaign finance violations, with deadlocks on votes being a common issue. The Department of Justice's oversight role has also been weakened under the Trump administration. Private actions and lawsuits are seen as potential avenues for enforcement, but these processes can be lengthy. The FEC's inability to function properly raises concerns about the transparency and legality of campaign financing in upcoming elections.
