## Article summary
Lithium-ion battery storage systems are increasingly connected to U.S. electrical grids to store and discharge power during high demand, but local opposition is growing due to fears of fires. Proponents argue these systems are safe, yet many localities have imposed moratoriums. In New York, Island Park passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed nearby. Long Island has seen significant activism, with the Trump administration recently taking notice. Battery storage systems, known as BESS, are crucial for integrating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, enhancing grid reliability and reducing blackouts. Globally, the U.S. and China lead in deploying these systems, with other countries also investing heavily. In the U.S., California and Texas are leaders, but other states are rapidly adopting them. Despite opposition, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the federal budget. New York aims to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030. Concerns focus on thermal runaway, a chain reaction that can cause fires or explosions, highlighted by a recent fire in Moss Landing, California. Experts note that while failures are infrequent, no system is 100% foolproof. Proponents argue that modern safety measures, like those in New York, mitigate risks. However, local residents remain skeptical, with some communities passing moratoriums to assess the technology further.
