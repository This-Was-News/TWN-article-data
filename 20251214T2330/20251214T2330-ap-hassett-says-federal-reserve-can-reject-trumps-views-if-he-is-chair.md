## Article summary
Kevin Hassett, a leading candidate to be President Donald Trump's choice for Federal Reserve chair, stated that while he would present Trump's views to Fed officials, they would have the autonomy to reject them when making decisions on interest rates. Hassett emphasized that the president's opinions would only hold weight if they were data-driven. This comes as Trump is reportedly in the final stages of selecting a replacement for current Fed chair Jerome Powell, with Trump expressing a desire for sharply lower interest rates. Hassett's comments aim to address concerns about the Fed's independence from political influence, a departure from the norm established by previous presidents. Trump has publicly stated his belief that his voice should be heard regarding interest rates, citing his business success. Other potential candidates, such as former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, are also being considered. Hassett reiterated that the Fed's ultimate job is to remain independent, with decisions made by a committee vote. The article also briefly mentions related news stories about an attack in Sydney, Australia, and a shooting at Brown University.
