## Article summary
Gunmen killed at least 15 people and hospitalized 42 others in a mass shooting at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach. One shooter was killed by police, and a second is in critical condition. Two police officers were also injured. The attack occurred during the "Chanukah by the Sea" event, attended by hundreds. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described it as a "targeted attack against Jewish Australians" and a "terrorist incident." Rabbi Eli Schlanger, an organizer of the event, was among the deceased. Footage showed civilians attempting to disarm one of the gunmen. Mass shootings are rare in Australia due to strict gun laws implemented after a 1996 massacre. This is the first deadly mass shooting in Australia since 2022. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the attack on Australia's government, accusing them of failing to stop the spread of antisemitism. U.N. Chief Antonio Guterres and Israeli President Isaac Herzog also condemned the attack and called for action against antisemitism.
