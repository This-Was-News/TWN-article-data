## Article summary
A shooting at Brown University in Providence, R.I., on Saturday afternoon resulted in two fatalities and nine injuries. Officials confirmed a person of interest is now in custody, a man in his 30s. The shooting occurred outside the Barus and Holley building, where final exams were underway. The suspect, described as a male dressed in black, fled on foot. Of the nine injured, seven are in stable condition, one is in critical but stable condition, and one has been discharged. At least 10 of the 11 victims are believed to be students. In response to the incident, Brown University has canceled final exams. The university, police, and FBI are collaborating on the investigation. While there was initial confusion about a suspect being in custody, authorities later clarified that the individual questioned was not the shooter. The identities of the victims and the suspect have not yet been released, though the deceased are described as community members. The shelter-in-place order for the campus has ended, but some areas remain restricted as active crime scenes.
