## Article summary
Girls and women fleeing Mali are speaking out about sexual violence allegedly committed by Russian forces, specifically the Africa Corps unit. The Associated Press gained rare access to a refugee camp in Mauritania, where they interviewed numerous individuals who shared harrowing accounts. One 14-year-old girl was allegedly raped by Africa Corps fighters after witnessing her uncle's beheading. Her condition deteriorated significantly due to lack of immediate treatment, highlighting the challenges faced by refugees with no financial means. Aid workers confirm that sexual assault is a pervasive issue in Mali's conflict, but a deep-seated shame prevents many women from seeking help or reporting the crimes. This silence not only exacerbates the trauma but also hinders efforts to hold perpetrators accountable. Other refugees described attempted rapes, destruction of their homes, and the murder of their husbands by similar forces. The legacy of sexual abuse is also linked to the Wagner mercenary group, which Africa Corps replaced, with past reports detailing mass rapes and killings. The Malian government's expulsion of the UN peacekeeping mission has further complicated the collection of data on conflict-related sexual violence. Despite the trauma, some survivors are beginning to receive psychological support, but aid workers fear many more cases remain unreported and untreated.
