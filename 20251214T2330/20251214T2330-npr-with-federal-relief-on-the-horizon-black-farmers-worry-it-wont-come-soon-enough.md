## Article summary
Black farmers are facing significant economic uncertainty due to retaliatory tariffs impacting crop prices, making it difficult to cover operational costs and secure loans for the next growing season. Despite a strong harvest year for some, like third-generation farmer James Davis, the inability to sell crops profitably threatens their survival. The Trump administration announced a $12 billion aid package for farmers, but many, including PJ Haynie of the National Black Growers Council, express concern that the payments, expected in February, will not arrive soon enough to meet immediate financial obligations.  Furthermore, the dismantling of USDA programs that historically assisted Black farmers exacerbates their challenges. Black farmers, representing a small fraction of U.S. growers, have faced systemic disadvantages for decades, leading to a significant loss of farmland. While the aid is appreciated, farmers like Finis Stribling III view the $12 billion as insufficient to address the deep financial losses incurred. Economists predict continued tight margins for farmers due to global market uncertainties and increased competition. The core issue remains the difficulty in making farming profitable on paper, with projected revenues not covering essential costs like inputs, equipment, and land rent. The long-term viability of Black farmers is a critical concern, as they strive to maintain and grow their presence in the agricultural sector.
