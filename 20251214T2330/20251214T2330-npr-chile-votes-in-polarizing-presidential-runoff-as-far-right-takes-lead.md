## Article summary
Chile is heading into a polarizing presidential runoff election between far-right candidate José Antonio Kast and left-wing candidate Jeannette Jara. Kast, who is currently leading in polls, is running for president for the third time and has focused his campaign on crime and migration, capitalizing on public fear fueled by media attention and an increase in violent crime and illegal migration. Kast's father was a German soldier and Nazi Party member, and his brother served as a minister during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, a period Kast himself defends. Despite his past controversial stances on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, Kast has largely avoided them in this campaign, focusing instead on security and proposed budget cuts. Jara, a former labor minister, presents a stark contrast, advocating for affordability, including a universal basic income, higher minimum wages, and reduced working hours. Her campaign emphasizes issues like lower electricity bills and state savings for homeownership. While Jara garners support from those who identify with her progressive policies and reject Kast's conservative views, polling suggests Kast is likely to win, potentially marking Chile's most right-wing leadership since the end of Pinochet's dictatorship. This potential outcome aligns with a broader regional trend of right-wing parties gaining influence in South America.
