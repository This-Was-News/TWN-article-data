## Article summary
Father and son gunmen killed at least 15 people, including a child, during a Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the attack as an act of antisemitic terrorism. One gunman was fatally shot by police, and the other, his son, was wounded and arrested. The victims ranged in age from 10 to 87, and at least 42 others were injured. The massacre occurred at a popular beach during the "Chanukah by the Sea" event. Among the deceased was Rabbi Eli Schlanger, an organizer of the event. A bystander was hailed as a hero for disarming one of the gunmen. This shooting is the deadliest in Australia in nearly three decades, a country with strict gun control laws. The event has intensified discussions about rising antisemitism in Australia, with some criticizing the government's response. Authorities are investigating the incident, including the discovery of two improvised explosive devices at the scene. The gunman who was killed possessed six firearms, raising questions about how he acquired them, especially given the rarity of mass shootings in Australia since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre.
