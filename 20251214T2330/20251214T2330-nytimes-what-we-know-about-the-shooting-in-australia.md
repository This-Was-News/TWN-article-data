## Article summary
At least 15 people were killed and dozens injured in a shooting at Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia, on Sunday during a Hanukkah celebration. The gunmen, identified as father and son, opened fire on a crowd, with the older gunman dying during the attack. Officials reported that 40 people were hospitalized, including two police officers, and the second shooter was wounded. Authorities have labeled the incident a targeted terrorist attack on Jewish Australians. Police discovered and disabled two improvised explosive devices in a vehicle linked to one of the suspects. Witness videos captured the chaos as people fled the beach amid gunshots, and one bystander was hailed as a hero for disarming one of the gunmen. This attack follows a pattern of increased targeting of Jewish people globally since the October 7th attacks in Israel, with similar incidents reported in Britain and the United States.
