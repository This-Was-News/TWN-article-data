## Article summary
An attacker who killed two U.S. service members and one American civilian in Syria had recently joined the country's internal security forces as a base security guard. The official stated that the attacker was reassigned due to suspicions of affiliation with the Islamic State group. The Syrian authorities had been rapidly recruiting personnel due to shortages following a rebel offensive. The attacker was among thousands recently added to a new division in the desert region known as the Badiya, where IS remnants remain active. Leadership became suspicious of an infiltrator leaking information to IS and began evaluating members. The attacker was moved to guard equipment as a precautionary measure, but on Saturday, he opened fire during a meeting between U.S. and Syrian officials, killing the three Americans and wounding three Syrian security forces members before being shot and killed. This incident occurs as the U.S. military expands cooperation with Syrian security forces, a partnership that has developed over the past year. Critics view the attack as evidence of IS infiltration within the Syrian security forces, while supporters argue that former members of groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham have a strong hatred for ISIS. The attack highlights the complexities of the partnership between the U.S. and Syria in combating the Islamic State group.
