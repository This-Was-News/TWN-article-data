## Article summary
A mass shooting at a Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, resulted in 15 victims killed and dozens injured. The attackers, identified as a 50-year-old man and his 24-year-old son, were described by authorities as a terrorist attack. The older man died after being shot by police, while the younger sustained critical injuries. Investigators are examining the suspects' motives and ideology. A bystander was hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming one of the gunmen. The victims ranged in age from 10 to 87, including a rabbi, a French citizen, and a Holocaust survivor. Mass shootings are rare in Australia due to strict gun laws enacted after a 1996 massacre. This attack is the latest in a series of antisemitic incidents in Australia and has drawn condemnation from world leaders, with many cities increasing security for Jewish communities. The Chabad organization, which hosted the event, is a global Hasidic Jewish movement known for its outreach efforts.
