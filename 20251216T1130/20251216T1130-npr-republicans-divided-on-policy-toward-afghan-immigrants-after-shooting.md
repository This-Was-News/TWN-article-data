## Article summary
Some Republicans in Congress are expressing concerns about the Trump administration's restrictive immigration policies towards Afghan nationals, particularly those who aided U.S. war efforts. This division emerges as President Trump intensifies his campaign for mass deportations and stricter migration controls. While the administration has paused visa programs and stripped temporary permissions to stay for Afghans, citing security concerns after a recent shooting incident involving an Afghan national, some GOP members like Senators Thom Tillis and Susan Collins argue for more careful vetting rather than blanket restrictions. They emphasize the importance of honoring commitments to Afghans who assisted U.S. troops and worry about the consequences for these individuals. The Republican split highlights a broader debate within the party, with some members pushing back against Trump's hardline stance on immigration. Historically, Afghan allies have received bipartisan support for their immigration cases, but Trump has recently declared a permanent pause on migration from countries like Afghanistan. The administration's policy changes throughout the year, including pausing refugee resettlement and restricting travel from Afghanistan, have stranded many, including those who helped U.S. forces. Advocates criticize Congress for deferring too much power to the executive branch on immigration policy, leading to a vacuum filled with fear rather than facts. While some Republicans are content to leave immigration matters to the executive branch, others, like Senator Bill Cassidy, support legislative solutions such as the "Fulfilling Promises to Afghan Allies Act" that allows for increased vetting and a pathway to legal residency. However, overall enthusiasm for addressing immigration in Congress remains low.
