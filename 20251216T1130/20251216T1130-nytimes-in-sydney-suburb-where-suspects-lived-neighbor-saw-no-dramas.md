## Article summary
In Bonnyrigg, a suburb of Sydney, the family home of the Bondi suspects showed little sign of activity, with only a parked car and muffled sounds indicating life inside. A delivery driver arrived with a ham and a racial slur, but the family did not answer the door. Neighbors described the family as having moved in about a year ago and largely keeping to themselves, with one resident noting he saw "no dramas." The suburb itself is characterized as a peaceful and aging community. Following the Sunday night shooting, police cars cordoned off the street, and by midnight, authorities instructed the family to exit the house with their hands up. Three individuals, two women and a man, were seen emerging from the residence.
