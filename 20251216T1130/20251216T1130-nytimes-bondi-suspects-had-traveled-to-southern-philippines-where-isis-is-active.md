## Article summary
The suspects in the Bondi Beach massacre in Sydney, Australia, had traveled to Davao, Philippines, according to Australian and Philippine officials. The two men, Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, were in the Philippines from November 1 to November 28. Davao is a major city on the southern island of Mindanao, an area with a history of Muslim insurgency and ISIS activity. Although the Philippines declared victory over ISIS eight years ago, the group remains a threat, albeit fragmented, with intermittent lethal attacks. Hundreds of Islamic State fighters are still active in the Philippines, recruiting by exploiting poverty and political grievances. These groups have shifted focus from establishing an Islamic state to supporting displaced Muslims, while still targeting police and Christian places of worship. A 2023 bombing during a Catholic Mass in Marawi killed four people. In response, the Philippine government has pursued reintegration programs for surrendered militants and established the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to grant greater political autonomy and undermine extremist support bases.
