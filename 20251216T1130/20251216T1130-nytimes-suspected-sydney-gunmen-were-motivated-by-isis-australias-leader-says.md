## Article summary
The gunmen responsible for the mass shooting at a Jewish celebration in Sydney on Sunday were motivated by Islamic State ideology, according to Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The suspects, a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son, had recently traveled to the southern Philippines, an area known for Islamic State activity. Investigators found two homemade Islamic State flags and improvised explosive devices in the car used by the gunmen. The father, Sajid Akram, was a licensed firearms holder, and the son, Naveed Akram, had previously come to the attention of authorities in 2019 but was deemed not to pose an immediate threat. Prime Minister Albanese has pledged to toughen Australia's already strict gun laws in response to the attack. The shooting targeted an annual beachside Hanukkah celebration, causing widespread panic. A bystander, Ahmed el Ahmed, is being hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming one of the gunmen. The attack has intensified concerns about rising antisemitism in Australia, with some members of the Jewish community criticizing the government's response. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, with authorities examining the suspects' travel to the Philippines and potential links to extremist ideologies.
