## Article summary
Nick Reiner, 32, has been arrested and booked on suspicion of killing his parents, director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner. The couple was found dead in their Los Angeles home. A decade prior to the incident, Nick and his father Rob had seemingly reconciled after years of the son's struggles with addiction. They collaborated on the film "Being Charlie," which incorporated elements of their personal story and appeared to mend their relationship. In interviews around the film's release in 2016, both father and son expressed that the project had brought them closer and helped them understand each other better. Nick Reiner had no other screen credits and lived a private life, with no prior criminal record. The Reiner family has not yet commented on the matter, and it is unclear if Nick Reiner has legal representation. Rob Reiner, a renowned filmmaker, was known for directing movies such as "When Harry Met Sally" and "The Princess Bride." He also had a daughter, Tracy Reiner, with his first wife, Penny Marshall.
