## Article summary
A shooting at Brown University during exam season has left students and the community frustrated with the official response and campus security. The attack resulted in two student fatalities and nine injuries. Authorities are actively searching for the gunman, canvassing for evidence and releasing new photos of a masked person of interest. However, the investigation has been hampered by a lack of sufficient security camera footage, particularly in the building where the shooting occurred. This has led to frustration among students who feel the university's surveillance systems are inadequate. A petition has been launched calling for increased security measures on campus. Law enforcement experts note that colleges often face disadvantages in responding to active shooter threats due to funding and training limitations for campus police. Additionally, changes to Providence's emergency alert system, from a mobile app to a web-based system, left some residents unaware of the shooting. The FBI is offering a substantial reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.
