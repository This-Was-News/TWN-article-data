## Article summary
Consumers enrolling in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace are facing significant increases in their health insurance costs due to uncertainty in Congress regarding the extension of subsidies. These subsidies, which have helped lower premiums, are set to expire at the end of the year, and lawmakers are debating various proposals. Many shoppers are delaying their enrollment decisions, fearing higher out-of-pocket expenses. Some are already opting for plans with higher deductibles to manage monthly premium costs. The debate in Congress involves differing views on the cost and policy implications of extending the subsidies, with some Republicans advocating for alternative solutions like Health Savings Accounts. The lack of a clear decision is creating anxiety for consumers and marketplace administrators alike. Early enrollment data shows a slight decrease in new sign-ups compared to the previous year, though returning customers are signing up slightly faster. The outcome of these congressional deliberations will significantly impact the affordability of health insurance for millions of Americans.
