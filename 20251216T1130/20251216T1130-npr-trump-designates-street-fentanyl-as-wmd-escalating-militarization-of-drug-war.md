## Article summary
President Trump has designated street fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, escalating the militarization of the drug war. Experts, however, are skeptical that this move, along with military strikes on drug boats and the reclassification of cartels as terrorist organizations, will effectively reduce fentanyl supply or overdose deaths in the U.S. Trump's administration claims these actions are necessary to combat "narco-terrorists" and save American lives, citing inflated numbers of potential deaths averted. Experts point out that fentanyl is primarily linked to widespread opioid addiction rather than being deliberately weaponized, and that military actions in the Caribbean have little impact on fentanyl trafficking, which is not typically transported by sea. Furthermore, critics argue that Trump's pattern of pardoning high-level drug traffickers undermines the deterrent effect of his "get tough" policies. While some conservative experts support the militarized approach, many drug policy researchers believe the overall impact on drug trafficking will be minimal, and that a focus on addiction treatment and harm reduction may be more effective.
