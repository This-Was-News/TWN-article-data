## Article summary
President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the BBC, alleging defamation and deceptive trade practices. The lawsuit claims the BBC intentionally misrepresented Trump's January 6, 2021 speech by splicing together two separate parts to create a false narrative. Trump asserts this was a deliberate attempt to interfere with the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The BBC had previously apologized for editing the speech but rejected claims of defamation. The documentary in question, "Trump: A Second Chance?", aired before the 2024 election and allegedly omitted parts where Trump called for peaceful demonstrations. Trump stated the BBC "put terrible words in my mouth that I didn't say." The lawsuit was filed in Florida, despite potential challenges due to the documentary not being initially shown in the U.S. The BBC, a publicly funded institution, is known for facing scrutiny from all political sides due to its charter to remain impartial.
