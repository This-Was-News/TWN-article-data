## Article summary
A mass shooting at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach, which killed 15 people, has been classified as a terrorist attack inspired by the Islamic State group. Among the victims were a 10-year-old girl described as having a gentle soul, and an 87-year-old grandfather who had survived the Holocaust. The victims included a dedicated assistant rabbi, a kind community pillar, a thoughtful volunteer who delivered meals, a talented soccer player, a retired police officer and rugby club legend, a heroic bystander who attempted to disarm a shooter, and a Holocaust survivor who died protecting his wife. The attack has sent shockwaves through Australia and the international community, highlighting a disturbing rise in antisemitic hatred. The victims are remembered for their kindness, dedication to others, and the positive impact they had on their communities. The attack occurred during a "Chanukah by the Sea" event, and authorities are investigating the motives and connections of the two gunmen.
