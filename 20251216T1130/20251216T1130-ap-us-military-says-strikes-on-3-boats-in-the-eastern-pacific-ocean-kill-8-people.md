## Article summary
The U.S. military announced it conducted strikes on three boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of eight individuals. These strikes are part of a broader campaign against alleged drug-smuggling operations, which President Trump has characterized as an armed conflict with drug cartels. The campaign has led to at least 95 deaths in 25 strikes since early September. Lawmakers are increasing scrutiny of these operations, with briefings scheduled on Capitol Hill. The military stated the strikes targeted designated terrorist organizations and provided a video of a boat exploding, but did not offer evidence of drug trafficking. This intensified military presence and action in the region has also put pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has seized a sanctioned oil tanker accused of smuggling illicit crude, with Maduro suggesting the operations aim to remove him from office. Trump has indicated that land attacks are imminent. The campaign has raised questions about the administration's military strategy and its justification.
