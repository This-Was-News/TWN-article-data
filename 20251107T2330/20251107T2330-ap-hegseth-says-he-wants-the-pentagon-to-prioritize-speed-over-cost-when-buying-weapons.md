## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a significant shift in the Pentagon's weapons acquisition strategy, prioritizing speed and rapid delivery over the development of complex, perfect technology. Speaking to military leaders and defense contractors, Hegseth aims to transform the acquisition system to operate on a wartime footing, accelerating the fielding of capabilities. He argued that an "85% solution" delivered quickly is more valuable than a delayed, ideal product, envisioning a process where tasks that once took years could be completed in one. This change is influenced by the effectiveness of Ukraine's use of cheap, mass-produced drones against Russia's advanced weaponry, highlighting the need for agility. While some experts caution that this approach might lead to less transparency and potentially inadequate systems, Hegseth pointed to the rapid development of the MRAP vehicle as a model for current efforts. He also intends to foster competition by moving away from traditional large contractors towards more innovative companies, though this raises concerns about potential fraud and lack of visibility. Additionally, Hegseth plans to streamline regulations to increase U.S. arms sales to allies, thereby boosting the domestic military industrial base.
