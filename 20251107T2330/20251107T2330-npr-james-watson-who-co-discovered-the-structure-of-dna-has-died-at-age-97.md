## Article summary
James Watson, a pivotal figure in molecular biology and co-discoverer of the DNA double helix, has died at the age of 97. Watson, alongside Francis Crick, developed the first accurate model of DNA's structure in 1953, a breakthrough that revolutionized the understanding of genetics and heredity. This discovery, which relied on crucial data from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, earned Watson, Crick, and Wilkins the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. Watson also played a significant role in advancing DNA research by directing Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and leading the Human Genome Project, where he notably championed the inclusion of bioethics studies. His popular 1968 book, 'The Double Helix,' offered a candid, albeit controversial, glimpse into the scientific process, though it drew criticism for its portrayal of Rosalind Franklin. Despite his monumental scientific achievements, Watson's legacy was significantly tarnished by his later years due to his public pronouncements on race, intelligence, and genetics, which were widely condemned as prejudiced and scientifically unfounded. These remarks led to his severing of ties with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and his ostracization from the scientific community. Watson's life story is seen by some as a tragedy, where the same drive and conviction that propelled his scientific success ultimately contributed to his public downfall.
