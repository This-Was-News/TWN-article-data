## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun implementing flight reductions at 40 major U.S. airports, aiming to decrease air traffic by 10% to ensure safety amidst ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages exacerbated by the government shutdown. These controllers are working without pay, leading to increased pressure and potential absences. Airlines are canceling hundreds of domestic flights, with reductions phased in gradually, starting at 4% and reaching 10% by next Friday. While airlines like Delta, American, and United aim to minimize customer impact by cutting regional or less frequent routes, the full extent of the disruption remains uncertain. The FAA's order also temporarily limits commercial space launches. Critics suggest the move may be politically motivated, while the airline industry insists safety is the sole concern. Travelers are expressing anxiety about potential cancellations and missed connections, with some already experiencing significant travel disruptions.
