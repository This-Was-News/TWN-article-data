## Article summary
Furniture prices have seen a significant increase, with living room, kitchen, and dining room furniture rising 25% and bedroom furniture up 11% since February 2020. While furniture industry insiders note that these increases are slightly lower than overall inflation and have decreased from their 2022 peak, the cost of furniture remains a concern for consumers. The industry faces higher expenses for utilities, insurance, and wages, compounded by pandemic-related surges in demand and shipping costs. Many mass-market furniture sellers feel pressure to keep prices low due to low barriers to entry and intense competition, including from second-hand goods and other consumer spending priorities. Historically, manufacturing has moved overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs, and while some components are imported to the U.S. for assembly, the final products are often made abroad, particularly in Vietnam, due to tariffs. Recent tariffs imposed on imports from China and other countries are increasing costs for furniture companies like Ashley Furniture, leading to price hikes. Despite a desire among some consumers to "buy American," the significant price difference between imported and domestically produced furniture often leads them to choose the cheaper, imported option. Many consumers, like Erin Cummins, are delaying furniture purchases due to sticker shock, prioritizing other rising costs such as health insurance, car insurance, and groceries over replacing worn-out furniture.
