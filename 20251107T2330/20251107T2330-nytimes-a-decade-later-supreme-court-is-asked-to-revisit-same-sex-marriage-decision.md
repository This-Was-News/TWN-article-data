## Article summary
A decade after the Supreme Court established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, the court is being asked to reconsider its landmark 2015 decision. This comes amid concerns within the LGBTQ+ community, heightened by the Supreme Court's willingness to overturn longstanding precedent, as seen in the abortion ruling, and urged by Justice Clarence Thomas. The Trump administration's actions targeting LGBTQ+ programs and funding have further fueled anxieties that marriage rights for gay people may be at risk. The justices are now considering a petition to overturn the 2015 ruling. This petition was filed by Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk who previously refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses due to her religious beliefs. Davis is seeking to reverse a court order requiring her to pay over $300,000 to a couple denied a license and to overturn the original same-sex marriage decision. It would require four justices to agree to hear the case. Legal experts anticipate the court may deny the petition, potentially announcing the decision as early as Monday. If the court agrees to hear the case, it would be a significant step, with deliberations likely extending over multiple conferences.
