## Article summary
In a Supreme Court case concerning President Trump's tariffs, a potential strategic blunder may have occurred when his lawyer, D. John Sauer, included extensive quotes from Trump's public statements in the government's main brief. This move could compel the justices to consider Trump's own words, which often emphasize the revenue generated by the tariffs, potentially contradicting the legal argument that they are primarily policy tools. The Supreme Court generally avoids relying on presidential public statements, preferring arguments made by lawyers in court. However, by incorporating Trump's bombastic claims about tariffs being a "BONANZA FOR AMERICA!!!" and raising "hundreds of billions of dollars," the brief may have opened the door for the court to view the tariffs as taxes, a power constitutionally reserved for Congress. Legal experts suggest this tactic, while possibly intended as client management, could backfire. This contrasts with previous cases, like the Affordable Care Act and the travel ban, where the Court largely discounted presidential remarks. The core of the legal debate hinges on whether the tariffs are primarily revenue-raising (suggesting a tax) or regulatory tools for foreign policy. The inclusion of Trump's direct quotes, particularly regarding the financial benefits, may force the Court to confront the apparent contradiction between his public pronouncements and his lawyer's courtroom defense, potentially leading to a ruling against the tariffs.
