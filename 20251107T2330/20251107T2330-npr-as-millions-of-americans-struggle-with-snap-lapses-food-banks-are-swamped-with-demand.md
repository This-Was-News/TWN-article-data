## Article summary
Millions of Americans are struggling with lapses in SNAP benefits, leading to an unprecedented surge in demand at food banks and pantries nationwide. In Boston, the ABCD Allston/Brighton Neighborhood Opportunity Center Food Pantry is experiencing a "madness" of demand, with some individuals facing two-week waits for assistance. This increased pressure comes after previous hits to food banks, including reduced federal food deliveries and increased demand from unpaid federal workers during a government shutdown. The situation is described as a "totally different curveball" by one pantry director, who notes record-breaking daily distributions. Volunteers are crucial in managing the overwhelming influx, but the scale of the problem is straining resources. Anti-hunger organizations report a significant increase in calls, with some pantries having to turn people away. While some state and local governments are stepping in with funding, and private donations are up, these efforts cannot fully compensate for the SNAP shortfall. The volume of food assistance provided by SNAP is vastly greater than what food banks can supply, making the current situation unsustainable. This crisis is forcing food banks to question their ability to provide other essential services and is raising concerns about the long-term viability of relying on nonprofits to fulfill a government's responsibility.
