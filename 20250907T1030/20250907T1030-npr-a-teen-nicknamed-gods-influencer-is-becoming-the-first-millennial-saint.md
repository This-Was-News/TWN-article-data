## Article summary
Carlo Acutis, known as 'God's influencer,' is set to become the first millennial saint, with his canonization ceremony at the Vatican. Acutis, who died of leukemia at 15 in 2006, is celebrated for his use of technology to promote Catholic faith, including creating a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles. His tomb in Assisi, Italy, is a pilgrimage site, with his remains displayed in a glass-sided tomb. Devotees worldwide pray to him for miracles, often through the internet, and his mother, Antonina Salzano, actively promotes his legacy. The Vatican recognizes two miracles attributed to Acutis, leading to his sainthood. The process involved assessing his spiritual life and influence, with his mother supporting the costs. Acutis is seen as a model for young people, and his relics, including a piece of his pericardium, have been touring globally, drawing thousands of worshippers. His canonization is expected to attract thousands of devotees, marking a significant event in the Catholic Church.
