## Article summary
The article discusses how President Trump has been undermining Congress's constitutional powers with little opposition from Republicans. Key incidents include barring a Democratic senator from visiting a military spy agency, launching military operations without congressional authorization, and canceling approved foreign aid funding. Trump's administration has also ousted confirmed agency leaders and restricted COVID-19 vaccine access despite prior assurances. Republicans, despite some private discontent, have largely acquiesced, allowing the executive branch to encroach on legislative prerogatives. This erosion of congressional oversight and spending powers marks a significant shift, with experts warning of long-term consequences. The article highlights specific examples, such as the Venezuelan drug cartel campaign and the withholding of intelligence assessments, to illustrate the broader trend of executive overreach and congressional capitulation.
