## Article summary
Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea have disrupted internet access in parts of Asia and the Middle East, though the cause remains unclear. Experts noted the disruptions, with concerns about potential targeting by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have denied past involvement. Undersea cables are crucial for internet connectivity, alongside satellites and land-based cables. Microsoft reported increased latency in the Middle East due to these cuts, while NetBlocks identified outages affecting multiple countries, including India and Pakistan. The affected cables, SMW4 and IMEWE, are managed by Tata Communications and a consortium overseen by Alcatel-Lucent. Internet users in the UAE reported slower speeds, and Pakistan Telecommunication Co. Ltd. acknowledged the cuts. The disruptions coincide with ongoing Houthi attacks targeting Israel over the Israel-Hamas war, with the rebels denying responsibility for the cable cuts. The Houthi attacks have included targeting over 100 ships, sinking four vessels and killing at least eight mariners. The situation remains tense as a potential ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance.
