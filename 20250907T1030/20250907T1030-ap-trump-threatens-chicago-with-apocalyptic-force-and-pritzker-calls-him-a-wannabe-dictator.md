## Article summary
President Donald Trump has threatened to send National Guard troops and immigration agents to Chicago, posting a parody image from the movie Apocalypse Now. He wrote on social media, 'I love the smell of deportations in the morning,' and hinted at aggressive actions. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, called Trump a 'wannabe dictator' in response. Trump recently signed an executive order to rename the Defense Department the Department of War, requiring congressional approval. The illustration in Trump's post shows him against a backdrop of the Chicago skyline, wearing a hat similar to a character from the film. Trump's administration plans to increase immigration enforcement in Chicago, following similar actions in Los Angeles. He has also suggested deploying troops in Baltimore and New Orleans, and hinted at federal intervention in Portland, Oregon. Chicago leaders have expressed widespread opposition and plan to sue the Trump administration. Pritzker criticized Trump's actions, calling them unprecedented and dangerous. Trump has claimed nearly limitless powers in deploying the National Guard, stating that he can do whatever he wants if he believes the country is in danger.
