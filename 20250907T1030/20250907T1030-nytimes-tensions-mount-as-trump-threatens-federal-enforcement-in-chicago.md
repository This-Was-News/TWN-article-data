## Article summary
Tensions escalated between President Trump and Illinois leaders after the White House posted an image on social media depicting Trump with helicopters, blowing flames, and the Chicago skyline. The post, titled 'Chicagocalypse Now,' referenced the 1979 war movie 'Apocalypse Now' and threatened a federal crackdown on illegal immigration in Chicago. This threat followed weeks of promises from the Trump administration to enforce immigration laws more rigorously. Chicago officials and immigrant advocates reported no unusual ICE activity but were monitoring the situation closely. Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor JB Pritzker criticized the post, calling it beneath the dignity of the nation and un-American. Thousands of Chicagoans protested against Trump's plans, with demonstrators expressing concern over increased ICE arrests and the potential deployment of the National Guard. Protesters also marched in Washington, D.C., against Trump's actions. Chicago has a significant undocumented population, and ICE has made numerous arrests in the area since Trump took office. Legal experts questioned Trump's authority to send National Guard troops to Chicago over the governor's objections. The anticipated crackdown coincided with celebrations of Mexican Independence Day, a significant event for the city's Latino community.
