## Article summary
Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation following growing calls from his party to take responsibility for a historic defeat in July's parliamentary election. Ishiba, who took office in October, had resisted demands for his resignation for over a month, citing the need to avoid a political vacuum amid key challenges. His resignation came ahead of a potential no-confidence motion and an early leadership election. Ishiba's ruling coalition failed to secure a majority in the upper house, further destabilizing his government. His decision followed a meeting with Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who suggested his resignation. Ishiba had previously emphasized the need to avoid a political vacuum due to challenges like U.S. tariffs and regional tensions. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had called for a complete overhaul after its election loss, with key figures urging an early leadership vote. Ishiba's resignation is expected to lead to an LDP presidential election in early October, with potential candidates including Koizumi and former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi. The next LDP leader will need to collaborate with opposition parties to pass legislation, as the LDP lacks a majority in both houses. Despite recent successes, such as lowering U.S. tariff rates, Ishiba's resignation marks a significant political shift in Japan.
