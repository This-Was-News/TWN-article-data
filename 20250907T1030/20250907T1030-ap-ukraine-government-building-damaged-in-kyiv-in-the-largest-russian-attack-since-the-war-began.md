## Article summary
Russia launched a significant aerial attack on Kyiv, Ukraine, using drones and missiles, marking the largest assault since the war began. The attack resulted in at least two deaths and multiple injuries, with smoke rising from the roof of a key government building, the Cabinet of Ministers. Ukraine's Air Force reported shooting down 747 drones and 4 missiles, but debris from downed targets caused damage at eight locations. This attack is notable as it is the first time a government building in Kyiv has been damaged. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, condemned the attack and called for stronger sanctions against Russia. The attack targeted various locations, including residential buildings, and followed recent diplomatic efforts by European leaders to end the war. Zelenskyy expressed readiness to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin but emphasized the need for political will to stop the violence. The incident highlights the ongoing conflict and the urgent need for a resolution.
