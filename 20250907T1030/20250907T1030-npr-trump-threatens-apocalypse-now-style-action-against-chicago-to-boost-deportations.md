## Article summary
President Trump threatened Chicago with mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, referencing the film 'Apocalypse Now' on his social media platform. He suggested deploying National Guard troops to Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans to curb crime, despite data showing a decline in violent crime in these cities. Chicago's Mexican Independence Day parade organizers prepared for potential immigration raids by increasing security and distributing 'know your rights' cards. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned Trump's threats, calling them unconstitutional and authoritarian. Major events in Chicago continued as planned, though some were postponed due to safety concerns. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker criticized Trump's actions, stating they were extreme and not normal. In Baltimore, officials discussed legal actions against potential troop deployments, while Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry supported Trump's plan for New Orleans. New Orleans' Democratic Mayor LaToya Cantrell's office remained neutral but emphasized ongoing efforts to reduce crime.
