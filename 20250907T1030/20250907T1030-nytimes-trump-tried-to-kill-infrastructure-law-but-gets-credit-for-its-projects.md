## Article summary
President Trump is now being credited for infrastructure projects funded by the 2021 law he opposed. Signs bearing his name have appeared at major projects, including a bridge replacement in Connecticut and rail-yard improvements in several cities. Trump had strongly opposed the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure law, calling it a loser for the U.S.A. The signs, in bold MAGA red, have sparked debate, with some viewing them as misleading. Representative Joe Courtney noted the irony of Trump's name on a project he opposed. The infrastructure law has fueled intense debates over credit, with some Republicans voting against it but later taking credit for funded projects. Amtrak has replaced signs featuring President Biden's name with those of Trump, following a change in presidential administrations. Senator Ted Cruz previously complained about Biden's signs, but his office did not respond to inquiries about Trump's signs. Infrastructure questions are sensitive for Trump, who promised a major rebuilding program but failed to deliver during his first term. The Federal Railroad Administration removed language requiring signs to credit Biden's law, leading to the removal of Biden's signs. The Connecticut bridge replacement is expected to create up to 300 jobs. Amtrak's future was uncertain under Trump's administration, but the company now appears secure. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Transportation praised Amtrak's recognition of the Trump administration's efforts in clearing a backlog of grants.
