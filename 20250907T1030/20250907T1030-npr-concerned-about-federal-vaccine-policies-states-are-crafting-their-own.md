## Article summary
States are taking independent actions to ensure COVID-19 vaccine access amid federal policy changes. New York declared a state-wide disaster emergency to preserve vaccine availability, while Massachusetts is making insurers pay for state-recommended vaccines. New Mexico is ensuring pharmacists can continue administering vaccines. Regional health coalitions, like the West Coast Health Alliance, are forming to coordinate vaccine recommendations. These actions respond to federal health agency staff and budget cuts, the firing of prominent doctors, and recent FDA restrictions limiting vaccine eligibility to those 65 and older or with health risks. States are diversifying their sources of vaccine information, including the Vaccine Integrity Project, due to concerns about the credibility of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Meanwhile, Florida is moving to end all vaccine mandates, contrasting with other states' efforts to protect access.
