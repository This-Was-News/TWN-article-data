## Article summary
Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro has been convicted of attempting a coup to overturn the 2022 election results, making him the first former president found guilty of such an act in the country. The Supreme Court panel sentenced him to 27 years and three months in prison, but he will not immediately go to prison and will remain under house arrest. Bolsonaro was charged with five crimes, including attempting a coup, participating in an armed criminal organization, and damaging heritage. The evidence presented showed Bolsonaro's involvement in planning to suspend election results and encouraging riots. Bolsonaro's lawyers plan to appeal the conviction and sentence, though experts believe this is unlikely to be accepted. The full Supreme Court can only accept an appeal if there are at least two dissenting votes, which is not the case here. If the sentence is finalized, Bolsonaro could be transferred to special incarceration as a former president. The trial has drawn international attention, with U.S. President Donald Trump linking tariffs on Brazilian goods to Bolsonaro's legal situation. Observers expect potential U.S. sanctions against Brazil following the trial. Despite his legal troubles, Bolsonaro remains a significant political figure in Brazil, and the conviction may pressure him to pick a political heir or prompt lawmakers to seek amnesty for him. Bolsonaro was previously barred from running for office until 2030 in a separate case.
