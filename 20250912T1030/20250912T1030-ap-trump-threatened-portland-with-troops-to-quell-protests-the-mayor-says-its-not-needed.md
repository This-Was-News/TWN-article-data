## Article summary
Protests have been ongoing in Portland, Oregon, outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building, with demonstrators facing pepper balls from officers on the roof. President Donald Trump has threatened to send federal troops to Portland, describing it as living in hell, despite a decline in violent crime. Local advocates and protesters criticize ICE, calling it cruel, and demand accountability. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has stated that federal intervention is not needed, as the city is managing the protests and occasional violence. Some residents and a nearby charter school have been affected by the protests, with the school relocating due to safety concerns. The protests have drawn national attention, with Trump's threats and the city's response highlighting the ongoing tensions. Despite the disruptions, some locals believe the protests are not as severe as portrayed nationally, emphasizing the divide in public opinion.
