## Article summary
Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) across the U.S. received threats on Thursday, leading to lockdowns, canceled classes, and heightened security. Authorities did not specify the nature of the threats, and no injuries were reported. The FBI is taking the hoax threat calls seriously but found no credible threat. Some schools canceled classes for the rest of the week and sent students home. U.S. Rep. Troy Carter condemned the threats, stating they must be met with swift and decisive action. Southern University in Louisiana and Alabama State University were among those affected, with lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders issued. Other HBCUs, including Clark Atlanta University, Virginia State University, Hampton University, and Bethune-Cookman University, also reported threats. The threats come amid heightened concerns about violence on campuses following recent events, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a shooting at a Colorado high school. Swatting incidents typically increase after violent events, putting schools on edge. Other HBCUs not directly threatened also tightened security measures. At the start of the school year, at least a dozen college campuses received hoax calls about active shooters, prompting lockdowns and safety protocols.
