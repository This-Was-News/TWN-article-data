## Article summary
As Israel mobilizes tens of thousands of reservists for its invasion of Gaza City, an increasing number of soldiers and their mothers are refusing to serve, despite the risk of imprisonment. This phenomenon is new in the nearly two-year war sparked by Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack, though it has not yet affected military operations. The defiance comes as Israelis join mass protests accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for political purposes instead of negotiating with Hamas to free the remaining 48 hostages. Many opponents, including former senior security officials, fear the latest offensive will achieve little and put the hostages at risk. Israel also faces heavy international criticism over the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the war and its blockade. One group of mothers, whose sons may be forced to return to Gaza, is calling on Israel's leaders to stop sending their children into war. Soldiers like Avshalom Zohar Sal, a 28-year-old medic who served multiple tours in Gaza, express exhaustion, demoralization, and uncertainty about what they are fighting for. A group called Soldiers for Hostages represents over 360 soldiers who refuse to serve, while another group, Save Our Souls (SOS), represents nearly 1,000 mothers of soldiers. These groups have held protests, met with government officials, and published letters to voice their concerns. Despite the risks, the number of refusals remains small, and the military emphasizes the essential contribution of reservists to national security. The war's prolonged nature and the government's failure to draft ultra-Orthodox men have fueled public resentment. A recent poll found that two-thirds of Israelis, including 60% of Israeli Jews, support a deal to release all hostages, cease hostilities, and withdraw Israeli forces from Gaza. However, Netanyahu has refused such a deal, insisting on the return of all hostages, the disarmament of Hamas, and maintaining security control over Gaza.
