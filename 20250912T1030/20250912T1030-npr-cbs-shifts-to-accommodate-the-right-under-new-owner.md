## Article summary
Under new owner David Ellison, CBS's parent company Paramount has taken steps to address concerns from the Trump administration, including hiring a conservative ombudsman, promising unedited interviews, and considering a top news executive with conservative views. These moves follow regulatory pressure and a settlement with Trump. Ellison, a Trump supporter, is also in talks to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, raising questions about CNN's future. CBS has faced criticism for editing interviews, including one with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The network's changes aim to appease Trump and his allies, marking a shift from its traditional journalistic legacy.
