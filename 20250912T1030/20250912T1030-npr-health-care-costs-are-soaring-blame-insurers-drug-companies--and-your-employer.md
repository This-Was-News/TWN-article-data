## Article summary
The United States has the most expensive health care in the developed world, and costs are rising. About 154 million people get health insurance through their employer, and many may see paycheck deductions, co-pays, and out-of-pocket costs increase by 6% to 7% next year. Employers will pay nearly 9% more per employee for the same level of coverage, facing the biggest price increase in 15 years. Many employers plan to pass these higher costs to workers through cost-cutting changes. The rising health benefits costs come as consumers are still feeling the effects of pandemic-era inflation and are uneasy about the economy. The high costs highlight the broken U.S. health care system, where employers ultimately decide how much workers pay for health insurance and medical care. Drug companies, pharmacy benefit managers, hospitals, and insurers have driven up the costs of medical care. While some reasons for the rise in health care prices are positive, such as more effective treatments, other factors include a loss of competition due to mergers and consolidations. Employers have been spending more on health care, with the average cost for family coverage exceeding $19,000 per employee last year. Workers have limited options to bargain over the prices set by their employers for health care.
