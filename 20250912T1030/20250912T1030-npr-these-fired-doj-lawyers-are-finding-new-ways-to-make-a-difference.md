## Article summary
Four prosecutors—Isa Jasewcz, Jennfer Blackwell, Sara Levne, and Carolyn Jackson—left the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington this year after being fired by the Trump administration. They were part of a group prosecuting individuals involved in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack. After their dismissal, they found new roles together in the Arlington County, Virginia, Commonwealth's Attorney's Office. They describe their abrupt termination as traumatic, especially since they were deeply committed to their work. Carolyn Jackson noted that her ongoing Capitol riot cases vanished after the new president granted clemency to all January 6 defendants. The group now handles a variety of cases, from shoplifting to malicious wounding. They reflect on the challenges of re-entering the job market, as big law firms avoided hiring them due to associations with the January 6 prosecutions. Despite these setbacks, they remain dedicated to public service. Meanwhile, the new U.S. Attorney in Washington, Jeanne Prro, has been recruiting new prosecutors, including 20 from the military's JAG Corps, to fill critical vacancies. The former DOJ lawyers express hope that they will eventually return to federal service to continue their fight for justice.
