Authorities in Utah are seeking public help to find the shooter who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk before fleeing from a university campus. Kirk was shot while speaking at Utah Valley University, and despite over 7,000 leads, no suspect or motive has been identified. Clues include a high-powered rifle found in a wooded area, a palm print, and a shoe impression. Officials released photos and videos of the suspected shooter, who appeared to blend into the campus crowd. A $100,000 reward is offered for information leading to an arrest. The attack was captured on video, showing Kirk being shot and spectators fleeing. Political figures, including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, have condemned the violence. Kirk, a prominent conservative figure, was known for his provocative debates on social issues. The shooting has sparked bipartisan condemnation amid a wave of political violence in the U.S.
