## Article summary
Inflation in the U.S. rose in August, driven by increases in grocery and gasoline prices. Consumer prices were up 2.9% year-over-year, higher than the previous month's 2.7%. Grocery prices jumped 0.6%, while gasoline prices rose 1.9%. Other items like new and used cars, clothing, and airfares also saw price hikes. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, was 3.1% over the last 12 months. This poses a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which is considering interest rate cuts to support the job market but may hesitate due to persistent inflation. The August data reflects a period when President Trump imposed tariffs on goods from U.S. trading partners, potentially contributing to higher prices for items like coffee, bananas, and apparel. A federal appeals court ruled some of these tariffs illegal, but they remain in effect pending Supreme Court review.
