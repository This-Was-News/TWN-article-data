## Article summary
A 16-year-old named Desmond Holly opened fire at Evergreen High School on Wednesday, September 10, 2025, around lunchtime. Holly shot two students before taking his own life. Authorities identified him as the shooter, noting he was radicalized online. The incident began around 12:30 p.m., with police receiving 911 calls about an active shooter. Holly fired multiple rounds inside and behind the school, reloading several times. Two victims were hospitalized, one in critical condition. The family of one victim, 18-year-old Matthew Silverstone, requested privacy. Many students fled the school, while others stayed and followed lockdown procedures. The motive remains unclear, but the attack appears to be both random and targeted. Authorities are investigating how Holly obtained the weapon and have issued warrants for his phone, locker, and family's home.
