## Article summary
The U.K. has dismissed its ambassador to the U.S., Peter Mandelson, due to his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mandelson, a former Labour Party minister, sent emails to Epstein in 2008 expressing support and calling his conviction wrongful. The emails, published by The Sun, were sent after Epstein's 2006 indictment for soliciting sex with a minor. U.K. Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty announced Mandelson's immediate removal, stating the emails revealed a relationship more extensive than previously known. Mandelson, known for his influential role in U.K. politics, had served as ambassador for seven months. His dismissal complicates Prime Minister Keir Starmer's efforts to build rapport with the Trump administration ahead of Trump's state visit. Photos and a birthday book message from Mandelson to Epstein have also surfaced, further damaging his reputation. Mandelson admitted in a TV interview that he regretted being deceived by Epstein. Opposition politicians criticized Starmer for retaining Mandelson despite the revelations. James Roscoe, a veteran diplomat, will replace Mandelson and oversee Trump's state visit with King Charles III.
