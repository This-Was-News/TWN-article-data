## Article summary
A panel of Brazilian Supreme Court justices sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison for attempting a coup to remain in office after his 2022 electoral defeat. Four of the five justices found Bolsonaro guilty on five counts, while one justice dissented. Bolsonaro, currently under house arrest, can appeal the sentence. U.S. President Donald Trump expressed displeasure with the conviction, calling it bad for Brazil. Bolsonaro's lawyers plan to appeal the verdict to the full Supreme Court. The trial has deepened political divisions in Brazil, with supporters and opponents of Bolsonaro taking to the streets. Justices presented evidence, including videos, to support the conviction. Bolsonaro faces accusations of attempting to illegally retain power and posing a threat to democratic rule. Despite his legal troubles, Bolsonaro remains a significant political figure and is expected to endorse a successor to challenge President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the next election.
