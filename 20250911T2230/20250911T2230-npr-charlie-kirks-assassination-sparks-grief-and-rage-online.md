## Article summary
The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has sparked widespread grief and anger among conservative influencers and supporters. Kirk, a prominent figure on the political right, was known for his advocacy of Christian conservative causes and his organization, Turning Point USA, which played a significant role in President Trump's 2024 victory. News of his death was met with emotional reactions from figures like Megyn Kelly and Glenn Beck, who expressed shock and sorrow. Conservative commentators quickly blamed the left and Democrats for the killing, with some suggesting without evidence that malevolent forces were involved. President Trump also weighed in, criticizing the radical left for their rhetoric, which he claimed was responsible for the terrorism seen in the country. Kirk's death has been mourned by many, with some calling him a martyr, while others have used the occasion to call for action against perceived political enemies. Despite condemnations from Democratic politicians, the anger among conservatives has not subsided, with some calling for retaliation against those they believe are celebrating Kirk's death. The authorities continue to investigate the shooting, but the narrative of a left-wing attack has already taken hold among many conservatives, raising concerns about potential further violence.
