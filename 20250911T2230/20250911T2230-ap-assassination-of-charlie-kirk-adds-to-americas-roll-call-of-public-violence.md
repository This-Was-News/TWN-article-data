## Article summary
The assassination of Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative commentator, during a question-and-answer session at Utah Valley University adds to the growing list of public violence in America. Kirk, known for his influential role in rallying young people to conservatism, was shot while engaging in a debate about gun violence. President Donald Trump announced Kirk's death on social media, and condemnation of the violence came swiftly from across the political spectrum. However, polarization and the normalization of violence in U.S. politics have deepened divisions. Experts like Kurt Braddock and Bruce Hoffman emphasize the need for leaders to unite the country and lower tensions. Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was a controversial figure known for his combative approach to conservatism, often facing protests on college campuses. His death has sparked calls for reflection on the state of American society and politics, with Utah Governor Spencer Cox urging citizens to reconsider their treatment of one another.
