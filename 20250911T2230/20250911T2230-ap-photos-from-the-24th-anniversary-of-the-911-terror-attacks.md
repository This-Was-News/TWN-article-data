## Article summary
Americans commemorated the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks with solemn ceremonies at ground zero in New York, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The events included moments of silence, tolling of bells, and the reading of the nearly 3,000 names of those killed. A photo gallery curated by AP photo editors captured various moments from the ceremonies, including flowers laid on inscribed names at the 9/11 Memorial, people bowing their heads during a moment of silence, and a bell being rung as each name was read. Attendees held up pictures of family members, and first responders and military personnel stood for the National Anthem. President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were present at the Pentagon ceremony. The ceremonies also included the daily Pledge of Allegiance at Chick & Ruth's Delly in Annapolis, Maryland, and the unfurling of an American flag at sunrise at the Pentagon.
