## Article summary
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the United States is not at war with Venezuela, despite the recent capture of former President Nicolas Maduro. Rubio explained that U.S. policy in Venezuela is being conducted through financial leverage and an "oil quarantine" rather than direct military intervention. This strategy aims to pressure Maduro's remaining allies to facilitate changes in the country, which the U.S. deems to be in its national interest. The U.S. military has been involved in enforcing sanctions, including intercepting oil tankers and intercepting alleged drug boats. President Trump indicated that the U.S. will "run" Venezuela following Maduro's capture. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the military operation, arguing that it violated the law by not obtaining congressional approval. Schumer plans to hold a vote on a war powers resolution to limit the President's ability to engage in military actions in Venezuela without Congressional authorization. Senator Rand Paul is currently the only Republican publicly supporting this resolution, and its passage depends on gaining further Republican support.
