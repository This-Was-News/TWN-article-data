## Article summary
Venezuela experienced a tense calm on Sunday, the day after President Nicolás Maduro was captured and removed by U.S. forces. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken from their Caracas residence to a New York airport. The U.S. military operation disrupted Caribbean travel, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. In Caracas, government supporters protested, demanding Maduro's release and holding up images of him and former President Hugo Chávez. Some residents in Catia La Mar showed damage to apartment complexes, claiming they were hit during the U.S. operation. The situation highlights the ongoing political instability and the U.S. involvement in Venezuela's affairs. Reports suggest Trump plans to seize and revitalize Venezuela's oil industry, though this faces significant hurdles. The capture of Maduro raises new legal questions regarding U.S. intervention and governance in Venezuela. The Monroe Doctrine is also cited as a factor in the U.S. arrest. The day after Maduro's capture saw continued displays of support for him and signs of damage in affected areas.
