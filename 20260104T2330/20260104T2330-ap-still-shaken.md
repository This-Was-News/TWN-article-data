## Article summary
An anxious quiet has fallen over Venezuela following the U.S. military operation that captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Many stores and restaurants remained closed, and those on the streets appeared shell-shocked. While some in the U.S. and Latin American countries celebrated Maduro's ouster, the reaction in Venezuela was more subdued, with some fearing government repression. Residents in affected areas are dealing with the aftermath of the operation, including property damage and loss of life. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Washington will use control of Venezuela's oil industry to force policy changes, though he clarified the U.S. does not intend to govern the country. Venezuelan officials maintain Maduro is still the rightful leader, with Vice President Delcy Rodríguez assuming interim presidential duties. Maduro's supporters have demanded his release from custody in New York, where his court appearance is scheduled. The situation has highlighted the deep political divisions and ongoing crises within Venezuela.
