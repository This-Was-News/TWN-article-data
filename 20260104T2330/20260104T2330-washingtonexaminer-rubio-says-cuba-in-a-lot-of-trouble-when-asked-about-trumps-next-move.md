## Article summary
Following the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Cuba is "in a lot of trouble." While not revealing specific future U.S. policies, Rubio emphasized that the Trump administration is not supportive of the Cuban regime, which he identified as propping up Maduro. Rubio highlighted the significant Cuban support for Maduro, noting that Maduro's bodyguards and internal intelligence were composed of Cubans. He also suggested that new elections in Venezuela are premature given the long tenure of the previous regime. Rubio indicated that the U.S. focus remains on addressing the problems caused by Maduro, with continued pressure, including an "oil quarantine," until necessary changes are made. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel condemned the U.S. operation against Maduro as a "criminal U.S. attack." In the aftermath of Maduro's ouster, the Venezuelan government reasserted control over Caracas with military and paramilitary forces.
