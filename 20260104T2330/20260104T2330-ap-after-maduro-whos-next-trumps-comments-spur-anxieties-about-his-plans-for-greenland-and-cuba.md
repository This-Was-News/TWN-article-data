## Article summary
Following the U.S. military operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump has renewed his interest in acquiring Greenland for U.S. security and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has issued stern warnings to the Cuban government, signaling an expansive U.S. role in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's comments about Greenland, a strategically located Arctic island, have caused concern in Denmark, which asserts its sovereignty and reminds the U.S. of existing security agreements. A social media post by a former Trump administration official, showing an illustrated map of Greenland in U.S. colors with the caption "SOON," further heightened tensions. Trump has previously expressed interest in Greenland and appointed a special envoy to explore making it part of the U.S. In Cuba, concerns are mounting as Rubio stated that Cubans guarded Maduro and were involved in his government's internal intelligence, suggesting a strong link between the two nations. Trump views the Cuban government similarly to Venezuela's, calling it a "very badly failing nation." Cuban authorities have denounced the U.S. operation in Venezuela, viewing it as a threat to the entire region. The U.S. administration's assertive approach is drawing parallels to historical doctrines like the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corollary, with some even referring to it as the "Don-roe Doctrine." This assertive foreign policy stance is raising questions globally about who might be next on the U.S. administration's agenda.
