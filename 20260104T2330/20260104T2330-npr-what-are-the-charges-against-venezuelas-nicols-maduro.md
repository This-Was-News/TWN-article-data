## Article summary
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are facing criminal charges in the United States following a military strike on Caracas and their subsequent custody. A new indictment in federal court in New York charges Maduro with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and weapons charges. Flores and other senior Venezuelan officials, including Maduro's son, are also implicated. The indictment alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders have exploited their positions to import tons of cocaine into the U.S., partnering with international drug trafficking organizations. Maduro allegedly sold Venezuelan diplomatic passports to drug traffickers and facilitated the return of drug proceeds from Mexico to Venezuela under diplomatic cover. Prosecutors claim Maduro and Flores trafficked cocaine seized by Venezuelan law enforcement and utilized state-sponsored gangs to protect their operations, ordering violence against those who owed them money or threatened their drug trafficking activities. These new charges build upon earlier indictments announced in March 2020. The U.S. had previously increased the bounty for Maduro's arrest and designated the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. The International Criminal Court is also investigating the Venezuelan government for alleged human rights abuses.
