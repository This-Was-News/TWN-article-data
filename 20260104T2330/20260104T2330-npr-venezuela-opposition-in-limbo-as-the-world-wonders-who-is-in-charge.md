## Article summary
Following a dramatic U.S. military strike on Caracas and the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, global uncertainty surrounds who is in charge of Venezuela. President Trump declared the U.S. would "run" the country until a transition, stating Maduro's deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, would partner in this effort. However, Rodríguez, sworn in as acting president by Venezuela's Supreme Court, publicly contradicted Trump, asserting Maduro remains the sole president and denouncing the U.S. action as "barbaric." This mixed messaging has left the situation in limbo, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio withholding judgment pending future actions. Maduro's allies, including Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, have adopted a defiant stance, urging Venezuelans to defend their sovereignty. The role of Venezuela's opposition, long persecuted, is also unclear. Opposition leader María Corina Machado called for opposition candidate Edmundo González to assume power, but Trump expressed doubts about Machado's support within Venezuela. While Rodríguez has a history of attempting market-friendly policies, her recent actions have solidified her loyalty to Maduro. The Venezuelan constitution mandates a new election within a month if the president is absent, but the unprecedented circumstances make its applicability uncertain. Legal experts note that Rodríguez's public statements suggest she is not interested in serving as interim president, and despite Maduro's capture, the tyranny in Venezuela may not have ended.
