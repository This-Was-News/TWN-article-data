## Article summary
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced his intention to bring the War Powers Act to a vote in the Senate this week, aiming to require President Trump to seek congressional approval for future military actions in Venezuela. This move follows the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Schumer criticized the Trump administration's actions as "lawlessness" and stated that the capture does not benefit Americans, contrasting it with the Democratic Party's focus on lowering the cost of living. He emphasized that if the resolution passes both houses of Congress, the president will need their consent for further involvement in Venezuela. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented that it is premature to hold new elections in Venezuela, as the U.S. focuses on addressing issues caused by Maduro's regime. President Trump stated on Saturday that the U.S. would manage Venezuela during a transition period and planned to involve U.S. energy companies in the country's oil industry.
