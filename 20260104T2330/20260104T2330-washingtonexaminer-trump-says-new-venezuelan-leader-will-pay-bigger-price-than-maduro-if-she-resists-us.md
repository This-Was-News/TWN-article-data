## Article summary
President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, stating that she will face greater consequences than the ousted President Nicolas Maduro if she defies the United States. This statement follows Rodriguez's defiant response to Trump's earlier suggestions that she would comply with U.S. demands, which she characterized as barbaric and rejected the notion of Venezuela becoming a U.S. colony. Trump's remarks, made in an interview with The Atlantic, implied that any change in Venezuelan leadership would be an improvement and suggested Rodriguez would pay a significant price for non-compliance. This represents a shift from his previous day's comments, where he seemed to believe Rodriguez was amenable to U.S. influence. Rodriguez, a respected figure who previously stabilized Venezuela's oil industry, publicly asserted that Venezuelans would never be slaves or a colony, and that Maduro remained the legitimate leader. Analysts had speculated about a potential backdoor deal, but Trump's latest comments suggest this is not the case. The article also briefly mentions Trump's interest in Greenland amidst geopolitical concerns.
