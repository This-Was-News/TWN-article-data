## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified the U.S. strategy towards Venezuela, emphasizing coercion through economic pressure rather than direct governance. He stated that the military quarantine on oil exports would remain in place to leverage the Venezuelan government into making policy changes, such as opening the oil industry to foreign investment. Rubio defended President Trump's earlier remarks about "running" Venezuela, explaining it referred to policy control, not occupation. The U.S. naval deployment near Venezuela aims to paralyze the regime's revenue generation. While not ruling out future troop deployments, Rubio indicated the focus is on exerting leverage. The Venezuelan defense minister condemned the U.S. actions as a violation of sovereignty. Trump also issued a warning to Venezuela's acting leader, Delcy Rodríguez, about facing consequences if she doesn't comply. The U.S. strategy, which has been criticized as "gunboat diplomacy," aims to force favorable conditions for American oil companies in Venezuela. Senator Mark Warner expressed concerns that such actions could alienate Latin America and embolden adversaries like China and Russia. Rubio, however, asserted the U.S. right to prevent the Western Hemisphere from becoming a base for rivals. The U.S. has been intercepting oil tankers, leading to a formal protest from Russia regarding one pursuit. Despite supporting Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado in the past, the administration is currently engaging with Rodríguez. Rubio also stated that the U.S. plans to curb drug trafficking from Venezuela, though the country's role in the drug trade is limited. He did not rule out Cuba as a potential future target for the administration's actions. Rubio defended the operation to seize Maduro as a law enforcement action not requiring congressional authorization.
