## Article summary
Groups across the United States organized protests following the U.S. capture and removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The feminist anti-war organization CODEPINK condemned the action as illegal acts of war, stating the U.S. bombed civilian and military sites and kidnapped Maduro. President Donald Trump described the event as a large-scale U.S. strike aimed at seizing Maduro and his wife, which occurred after months of escalating conflict. Protests were held in major cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Portland, and Washington, D.C. Demonstrators carried signs such as "No blood for oil" and "Stop bombing Venezuela now." Trump cited Maduro's alleged role in flooding the U.S. with criminals and drug traffickers as justification. Protesters, however, viewed the action as an illegal move to serve the interests of those in power and exploit Venezuela's natural resources. The Answer Coalition also listed over 100 protest locations nationwide. The Trump administration stated that Maduro and his wife face criminal charges in New York, with Attorney General Pam Bondi vowing they would face "the full wrath of American justice."
