## Article summary
American taxpayers are facing high costs of living while refugees continue to receive over a dozen federal benefits, as Congress considers quadrupled funding for refugee programs. The Biden administration has admitted hundreds of thousands of refugees, primarily from Afghanistan and Somalia, leading to a significant increase in funding for Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs, from under $2 billion in fiscal year 2021 to nearly $9 billion in fiscal year 2022. This surge in funding is attributed in part to the admission of nearly 200,000 Afghan evacuees between 2021 and 2023. Eligible benefits for refugees include a wide range of programs such as SNAP, WIC, housing assistance, Medicaid, and educational aid. Additionally, refugees may receive cash assistance, employment services, and legal aid. Total federal spending on refugee and migrant assistance programs has reached approximately $30 billion over four years. Despite these extensive benefits, Afghan refugees, in particular, face challenges such as lower English proficiency, lower educational attainment, and higher poverty rates compared to other immigrant groups and the U.S.-born population. A significant percentage of Somali immigrants in Minnesota also rely on taxpayer-funded welfare programs. As Congress reconvenes, a bill allocating $5.69 billion for refugee assistance services is on the agenda.
