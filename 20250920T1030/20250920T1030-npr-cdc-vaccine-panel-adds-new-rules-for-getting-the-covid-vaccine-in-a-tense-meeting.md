## Article summary
The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) held a tense meeting to discuss COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. The panel ultimately decided against requiring a prescription for the vaccine but narrowed its recommendation to adults 65 and older and younger people, subject to shared decision-making with a clinician. The committee also voted to include more information about potential risks and uncertainties related to the vaccine. The meeting was marked by confusion, technical difficulties, and heated debates, with some members expressing concerns about reduced vaccine access and overwhelmed healthcare providers. The ACIP, appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has faced criticism for its approach to vaccine policy. States and insurance companies have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the ACIP's decisions, with some forming alliances to issue their own recommendations. The CDC's acting director, Jim O'Neill, must sign off on the panel's votes for them to become final. The meeting highlighted the politicized nature of vaccine policy under Kennedy's leadership, which has diverged from positions held by major medical organizations.
