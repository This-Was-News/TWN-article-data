## Article summary
President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on September 19, 2025, introducing significant changes to the U.S. visa system. The first order created the 'Trump Gold Card,' a new visa category for foreign nationals willing to invest $1 million in the U.S. or have their employers invest $2 million to sponsor them. This program aims to raise over $100 billion for tax cuts and debt reduction. The second order imposed a $100,000 annual fee for each high-skilled worker entering the U.S. through the H-1B visa program, targeting abuse and protecting American workers. The H-1B program, which allows 85,000 visas annually, is primarily used by large tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. The administration claims the program is misused to hire foreigners at lower wages. The new fee aims to discourage this practice and ensure companies hire Americans for training roles. The orders also hint at a future 'Platinum Card' visa, costing $5 million, which would allow foreigners to stay up to 270 days without U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. These changes are part of a broader effort to raise revenue for immigration enforcement initiatives.
