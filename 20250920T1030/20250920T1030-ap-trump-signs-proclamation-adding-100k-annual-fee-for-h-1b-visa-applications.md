## Article summary
President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications and introduced a $1 million gold card visa for wealthy individuals seeking U.S. citizenship. The H-1B visa fee, which would increase from $215, and the investor visa fee, rising from $10,000-$20,000, face legal challenges and criticism for bypassing Congress. The changes aim to reduce the number of H-1B visas issued annually, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggesting the high fee will make it economically unviable for many companies. Trump also announced a $5 million platinum card visa, allowing foreigners extended stays without U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income, though it requires congressional approval. Critics argue the H-1B program undercuts U.S. wages and displaces American workers, while supporters of the changes applaud the move. Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery, with top recipients including Amazon, Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple, and Google. The program has faced criticism for awarding visas to entry-level jobs and allowing companies to pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels. In 2024, lottery bids for H-1B visas dropped nearly 40%, attributed to measures against fraudulent applications. Major tech companies have sought changes to the lottery system, and labor groups advocate for awarding visas based on higher wages rather than random selection.
