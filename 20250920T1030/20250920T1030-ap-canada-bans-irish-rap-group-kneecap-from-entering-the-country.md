## Article summary
The Canadian government has banned the Irish-language rap group Kneecap from entering the country, citing their endorsement of political violence and terrorism. The group has been criticized for statements seemingly glorifying militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, leading to previous bans, such as in Hungary. Liberal lawmaker Vince Gasparro stated that Kneecap's support for these organizations goes beyond artistic expression and violates Canada's stance against hate speech and terrorism. Kneecap denies supporting Hezbollah and Hamas, accusing critics of trying to silence their support for the Palestinian cause. The group plans to take legal action against Gasparro, asserting their opposition to what they describe as a genocide by Israel. Kneecap was scheduled to perform in Toronto and Vancouver but will no longer do so. Advocacy organizations in Canada support the ban, viewing it as a stand against incitement and radicalization. Kneecap's performance at Coachella, where they accused Israel of genocide, sparked controversy and led to cancellations of other gigs.
