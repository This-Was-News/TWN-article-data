## Article summary
Utah Valley University (UVU), known for its safety and strong ties to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained unwanted national attention after the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on its campus on September 10. The university, which had minimal violence in recent years, is now grappling with its newfound infamy and how to reshape its identity. Students and faculty returned to classes this week, dealing with grief, fear, and anxiety. University leaders are focusing on safety and healing, hoping to model resilience and embrace difficult dialogues. Some students feel the university failed to provide adequate security, while others believe the shared trauma has brought the community closer together. The school is considering how to address the fallout, with some looking to other institutions like Columbine and Virginia Tech for guidance. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox met with students, acknowledging the difficulty of the situation and emphasizing the importance of the university's story beyond the shooting.
