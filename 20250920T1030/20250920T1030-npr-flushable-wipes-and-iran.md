## Article summary
The article discusses the growing threat of cyberattacks on U.S. water treatment facilities, highlighting the experiences of Chris Hughes, an assistant water and wastewater operator in Vermont. Hughes deals with various issues, from power outages to 'flushable' wipes clogging the system. However, a new and alarming threat has emerged: hackers targeting water systems. Iranian, Russian, and Chinese hackers have already infiltrated and disrupted water treatment plants in the U.S. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has labeled cyberattacks on water systems as an increasing problem. Hughes is now participating in Project Franklin, a pilot program that pairs water operators with cybersecurity experts to secure critical infrastructure. The article also mentions the antiquated systems and limited resources of many water treatment facilities, making them vulnerable to cyber threats. Experts warn that hackers are becoming more sophisticated and that the U.S. must prioritize cybersecurity to protect its water systems.
