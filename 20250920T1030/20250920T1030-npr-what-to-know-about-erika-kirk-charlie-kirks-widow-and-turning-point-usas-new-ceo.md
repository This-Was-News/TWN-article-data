## Article summary
Erika Kirk, a faith-based entrepreneur and widow of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has been unanimously elected as the new CEO and board chair of Turning Point USA, the right-wing youth organization her husband founded. Following Charlie Kirk's assassination in September 2025, Erika pledged to continue his mission, vowing to expand the organization's campus tour, annual AmericaFest conference, and radio show. The organization has seen a surge in interest, with over 62,000 requests from students to start or join chapters. Erika, a former college basketball player and pageant queen, advocates for traditional views of gender and marriage, encouraging women to prioritize family and homemaking. She runs a Christian clothing line and hosts a devotional podcast. Erika and Charlie met in 2018, married in 2021, and had two children together. She plans to continue her husband's legacy, urging young people to join or start Turning Point USA chapters. The organization's board vowed to make Charlie's work 'more powerful and enduring than ever before.'
