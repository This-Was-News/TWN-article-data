## Article summary
Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across nine regions in Ukraine early Saturday, killing at least three people and wounding dozens. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that the attacks targeted infrastructure, residential areas, and civilian enterprises, including a multi-story building in Dnipro hit by a missile with cluster munitions. Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as a deliberate strategy to intimidate civilians and destroy infrastructure. He also announced plans to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and discussed potential talks between the first ladies on humanitarian issues involving children. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, at least 30 people were wounded, and several buildings were damaged. Ukrainian forces shot down a significant number of drones and missiles, highlighting the effectiveness of Western weapons. Meanwhile, Russia denied violating Estonian airspace after Tallinn reported unauthorized incursions by Russian fighter jets. Zelenskyy also discussed long-term security guarantees for Ukraine and the importance of maintaining sanctions against Russia if peace efforts stall.
