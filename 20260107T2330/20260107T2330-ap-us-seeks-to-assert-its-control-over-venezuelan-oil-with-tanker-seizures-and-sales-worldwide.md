## Article summary
The Trump administration is asserting control over Venezuelan oil through the seizure of two sanctioned oil tankers and plans to oversee the sale of Venezuela's petroleum globally. These actions follow the U.S. ouster of President Nicolás Maduro and aim to give the administration leverage over global oil supplies and prices. Vice President JD Vance stated that controlling energy resources allows the U.S. to dictate oil sales to serve American interests without U.S. casualties. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that oil seized from the tankers would be part of a deal for Venezuela to provide oil to the U.S. The U.S. European Command announced the seizure of the merchant vessel Bella 1 in the North Atlantic and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the M Sophia was taken in the Caribbean, both for violating U.S. sanctions. These vessels are part of a "shadow fleet" used for smuggling oil. The administration is selectively easing sanctions to facilitate immediate sales of 30 to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, with proceeds going to U.S.-controlled accounts. The Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA is reportedly negotiating these sales with the U.S. government. The U.S. also plans to authorize the import of oil field equipment and invest in Venezuela's electricity grid to increase production and improve living conditions.
