## Article summary
Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota is preparing to deploy the Minnesota National Guard in response to a fatal shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis. The incident occurred when a 37-year-old woman allegedly attempted to run over an ICE officer with her vehicle, prompting the officer to fire his weapon. While the Department of Homeland Security maintains the officer acted in self-defense, Governor Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey dispute this claim. Walz emphasized that the National Guard troops are community members and that Minnesota will not be a "prop in a national political fight," urging for peaceful protests. The shooting has heightened tensions in Minneapolis, where DHS recently deployed additional ICE officers amid federal efforts to detain undocumented immigrants and investigate fraud schemes. Video footage of the aftermath shows the woman's vehicle crashing into another car after she was shot through the windshield. The identity of the deceased victim has not yet been officially released, and Walz plans to speak with the family once identified. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison criticized the increased presence of ICE agents, suggesting it contributed to the "aggression and terror" in the community and calling it a "causal factor" in the tragic death. The situation is being closely monitored, given Minneapolis's history of unrest, as seen in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd.
