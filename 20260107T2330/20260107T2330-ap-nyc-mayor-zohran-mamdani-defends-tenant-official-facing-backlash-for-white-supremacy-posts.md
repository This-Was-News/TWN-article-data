## Article summary
NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani is defending Cea Weaver, a newly appointed housing official, who is facing backlash for past social media posts. These posts, which have since been deleted, included controversial statements about private property and homeownership, linking it to white supremacy. Critics, including former Mayor Eric Adams and the Washington Post's editorial board, have condemned Weaver's remarks. However, Mayor Mamdani is standing by Weaver, highlighting her extensive record as a tenant activist and her role in advocating for tenant protections. Weaver herself has expressed regret for some of her past statements, emphasizing her current focus on ensuring safe and affordable housing for all. This situation arises shortly after another official resigned due to antisemitic social media posts from over a decade ago. Despite the controversy, the administration, through a mayoral spokesperson, indicated that Weaver's past posts were known. Weaver's appointment is significant as she is expected to play a crucial role in implementing one of Mayor Mamdani's key campaign pledges: a proposal to force negligent landlords to negotiate property sales to the city. This initiative has already faced opposition from landlord groups and skepticism from some city officials. The mayor has signaled his commitment to this policy by taking action against a Brooklyn apartment building owner with outstanding city debts.
