## Article summary
An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot a Minneapolis motorist during a federal immigration crackdown, sparking outrage and protests. The incident occurred when the officer approached the woman's SUV, which was blocking the road. Video evidence shows the SUV moving forward as the officer fires multiple shots into it at close range. Federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, described the act as self-defense against domestic terrorism, claiming the woman attempted to run over officers. However, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey vehemently rejected this narrative, calling it "garbage" and "bullshit," and criticized the federal operation for causing "chaos and distrust" and "literally killing people." He demanded that ICE leave the city and state immediately. The Minneapolis Police Chief stated that the driver was shot in the head and did not indicate she was trying to harm anyone. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety announced it will investigate the shooting alongside federal authorities. The Department of Justice's policy generally prohibits using firearms to disable moving vehicles unless there is an imminent threat of deadly force. This shooting is part of a larger immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis, partly targeting alleged fraud involving Somali residents. Similar incidents have occurred in other cities, such as Chicago, where a woman survived being shot by a Border Patrol agent under disputed circumstances. The shooting has led to protests, with groups like Black Visions condemning the violence and pastors gathering to advocate for peace. Governor Tim Walz also expressed outrage but called for peaceful protest, labeling federal claims as "propaganda."
