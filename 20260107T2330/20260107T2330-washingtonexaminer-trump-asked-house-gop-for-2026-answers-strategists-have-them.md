## Article summary
President Donald Trump is seeking strategies from House Republicans to maintain their majority in the upcoming midterm elections, as he questioned the public's current mindset. Strategists suggest a return to core economic issues, such as a "reconciliation 2.0" bill offering a $2,000 rebate check funded by tariffs. Trump is also expected to push for further tax cuts, spending reductions, and clawbacks of education funding. Additionally, infrastructure spending on energy and highways is highlighted as crucial for future victories. Trump's recent actions, including the capture of Nicolas Maduro, have also drawn attention, while his legislative priorities include cryptocurrency regulations, affordable housing, and energy permitting reform. He urged Republicans to emphasize their record on border security, prescription drug prices, and criticism of Joe Biden's policies. To ensure victory, strategists advise nationalizing the midterms by making Trump a central figure, akin to a presidential election, to drive turnout. This strategy aims to secure not only the House in 2026 but also the White House in 2028. Despite historical trends and current polling suggesting the country is on the wrong track, Republicans hold a slight edge in generic congressional ballot polls. Democrats, however, express confidence in retaking the House, needing to flip only three seats. The Republican Senate majority is considered more secure due to fewer competitive seats.
