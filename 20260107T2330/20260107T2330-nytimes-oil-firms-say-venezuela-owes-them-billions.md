## Article summary
Western oil companies are seeking tens of billions of dollars from Venezuela, with Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips leading the claims. These companies were forced out of the country over two decades ago by disputes with the leftist government, leading to significant declines in Venezuela's oil production due to corruption and mismanagement. President Trump has expressed support for U.S. oil companies' claims, stating that the socialist regime stole their investments. ConocoPhillips claims $12 billion, while Exxon Mobil estimates its claim at $20 billion. Chevron is the only U.S. company that remained in Venezuela and is positioned to benefit from potential new U.S. investments. Companies have pursued compensation through international arbitration and U.S. courts, but turning these decisions into cash has been difficult. European energy companies also have claims, though smaller than those of U.S. giants. The Trump administration is negotiating a deal for the U.S. government to control sales of Venezuelan oil, with revenues intended for economic stabilization and later compensation for oil companies. However, investors remain wary, and restoring Venezuela's oil production would require substantial investment, estimated at $10 billion annually for a decade.
