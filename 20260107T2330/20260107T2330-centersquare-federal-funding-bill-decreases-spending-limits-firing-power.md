## Article summary
The U.S. House of Representatives is set to pass a funding bill to prevent a government shutdown, which also includes provisions to limit the firing of federal workers. This package allocates funds for departments including Commerce, Justice, Energy, Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Notably, the bill proposes budget cuts for the Departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy compared to previous levels, with a 4% reduction for the EPA. NASA and the National Park Service will also see a 2% decrease in their budgets. Democrats have praised the bill for countering proposed cuts from the Trump administration and supporting scientific research, while Republicans emphasized the continued provision of essential government services. The legislation includes an increase for the Department of Energy's Office of Science to support research at national labs. A critical aspect of the bill is its prevention of agencies using appropriated funds for reorganization efforts, seemingly aimed at averting mass firings and cuts experienced previously. This measure reasserts Congress's control over spending decisions. However, if passed, six more appropriations bills will still need to be approved by January 30th.
