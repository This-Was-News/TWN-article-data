## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has outlined a three-step plan for Venezuela, focusing on stabilization, recovery, and leadership transition. The initial phase aims to prevent chaos by managing the country's resources, including seized oil, to benefit the Venezuelan people rather than the regime. The recovery phase seeks to ensure fair market access for international companies and promote reconciliation within Venezuela, including the potential amnesty and release of political prisoners. Following these steps, the U.S. would oversee a transition of leadership, though the specifics remain unclear. President Donald Trump has indicated a willingness to allow acting President Delcy Rodríguez to continue in the short term. European leaders, however, are calling for an immediate transition to democratic rule, referencing Edmundo González as a potential legitimate leader. María Corina Machado, another opposition figure, has been deemed by Trump as lacking the necessary support to lead. The U.S. plans to maintain long-term control over Venezuelan oil sales, as indicated by Energy Secretary Chris Wright. This strategy follows the U.S. seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker sailing under a Russian flag.
