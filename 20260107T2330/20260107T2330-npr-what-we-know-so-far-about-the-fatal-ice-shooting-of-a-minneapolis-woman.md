## Article summary
Federal and local officials are disputing the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. The incident occurred during targeted immigration enforcement operations in south Minneapolis. Videos show an ICE officer firing into Good's vehicle after it reversed and then moved forward. While the Department of Homeland Security and President Trump claim the officer acted in self-defense against a "weaponized vehicle," Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey vehemently disagrees, calling the federal account "bullshit" and accusing ICE of recklessly using power. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz also urged the public not to believe the federal "propaganda machine" and promised a full investigation. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara expressed concern over the federal agents' tactics, noting that shooting into a vehicle, especially when the occupant is unarmed, is highly concerning. The shooting, which occurred near the site of George Floyd's murder, has further strained relations between the city and the Trump administration. The FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating the use of deadly force.
