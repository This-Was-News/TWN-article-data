## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has introduced new dietary guidelines for Americans, emphasizing whole foods, healthy proteins, and fats, while declaring "war" on added sugar. The updated food pyramid places meat, cheese, vegetables, and fruits at the top, signaling a significant shift in nutrition policy. Kennedy stated that "protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines," and that the administration is "ending the war on saturated fats." The guidelines also call for a "dramatic reduction" in the consumption of highly processed foods, which are linked to obesity and other health issues affecting over 70% of American adults. This new approach aims to change the health trajectory for many Americans by moving away from refined foods. However, the guidelines have drawn criticism, with some experts like Christopher Gardner expressing disappointment that red meat and saturated fats are now prioritized, which they believe goes against decades of research. The guidelines also elevate cheese and dairy, including full-fat options, to the top of the pyramid, supported by emerging evidence suggesting dairy foods can be beneficial for health. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist, supports the recommendations to reduce highly processed foods, calling it a "very positive move for public health." Despite most Americans not directly reading the guidelines, they significantly influence school meals, military base food, and federal food aid programs.
