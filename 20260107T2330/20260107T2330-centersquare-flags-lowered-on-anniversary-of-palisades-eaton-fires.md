## Article summary
California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered flags lowered to half-staff on the one-year anniversary of the devastating Palisades and Eaton wildfires in Los Angeles County. These fires, which began on January 7, 2025, resulted in 31 fatalities and burned over 35,000 acres, destroying homes, businesses, and schools. In remembrance, Newsom highlighted the scale of the disaster and the need for continued efforts in wildfire prevention and emergency response, emphasizing the role of climate change in exacerbating such events. Concurrently, California's congressional delegation urged President Donald Trump to maintain federal disaster relief funding, acknowledging the significant aid already provided by agencies like FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration. The Palisades Fire alone consumed 23,448 acres, claimed 12 lives, and destroyed 6,833 structures, with a suspect, Jonathan Rinderknecht, awaiting trial. The Eaton Fire impacted 14,021 acres, causing 17 deaths and the destruction of 9,418 structures, with faulty equipment from Southern California Edison identified as the cause. Governor Newsom also announced expanded eligibility for the CalAssist Mortgage Fund and explored new financing programs to aid wildfire survivors in rebuilding. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass acknowledged that full recovery would be a multi-year endeavor, pledging her support to restore the affected communities. The day served as a tribute to victims, first responders, and community leaders who responded to the crisis.
