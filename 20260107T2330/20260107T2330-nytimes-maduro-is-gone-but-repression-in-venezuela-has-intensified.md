## Article summary
Following the capture of Nicolás Maduro by the United States, Venezuela's government, now led by interim leader Delcy Rodríguez, has intensified its repression of citizens. Security forces are actively searching phones and detaining individuals for expressing support for Maduro's removal. Despite the U.S. denouncing Venezuela's human rights record, the Trump administration appears to be prioritizing oil deals and expelling foreign spies over democracy and human rights. Reports indicate a 90-day state of emergency has been declared, granting broad powers to security forces and further eroding civil liberties. This crackdown includes increased police presence, the deployment of armed militias known as colectivos, and the establishment of numerous checkpoints for searches and interrogations. Journalists have been detained, and citizens have faced extortion for celebrating Maduro's capture. The government is orchestrating rallies to show support for Maduro while simultaneously suppressing dissent, highlighting a stark contrast between public actions and private crackdowns. This intensified repression, occurring with apparent U.S. backing, raises concerns about the future of democracy and human rights in Venezuela.
