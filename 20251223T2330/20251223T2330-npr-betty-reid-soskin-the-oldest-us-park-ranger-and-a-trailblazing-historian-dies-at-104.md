## Article summary
Betty Reid Soskin, the nation's oldest park ranger and a trailblazing historian, passed away on December 21st at the age of 104. Soskin dedicated her life to preserving the stories of marginalized communities, particularly Black Americans and women during World War II. Born in 1921, her early life was shaped by the Great Mississippi Flood and experiences with systemic racism, which fueled her lifelong commitment to advocacy and justice. She co-founded one of the first Black-owned record stores in the Bay Area, which served as a community hub and a space for activism. Later in life, she became a prominent voice at the Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front National Historical Park, sharing her firsthand experiences and ensuring that overlooked histories were brought to the forefront. Soskin often stated, "What gets remembered is a function of whos in the room doing the remembering." Her impact was recognized with numerous accolades, including being honored as California Woman of the Year and receiving a presidential coin from Barack Obama. In 2022, a middle school was renamed in her honor, a student-led initiative celebrating her legacy of truth and justice. Despite surviving a violent home invasion, Soskin demonstrated remarkable resilience, returning to work weeks later. Her life and work were chronicled in her memoir, "Sign My Name to Freedom," which inspired a stage play and a documentary. Even after retiring at 100, Soskin continued to inspire through public appearances, emphasizing the importance of storytelling and inclusive historical narratives.
