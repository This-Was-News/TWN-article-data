## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security is replacing the H-1B visa lottery system with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers. This change, implemented by the Trump administration, aims to address criticisms that the program has been exploited to hire overseas workers at lower wages than Americans. The existing lottery system was seen as abused by employers seeking cheaper labor. The new system will use a weighted selection process to favor higher-skilled and higher-paid individuals. This modification is part of broader efforts by the administration to reshape the visa program. Historically, H-1B visas were allocated via a lottery, with major tech companies like Amazon being top recipients. The new rule is set to take effect on February 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming registration season. While supporters argue the H-1B program is crucial for hiring in specialized fields and drives innovation, critics contend it can lead to wage suppression and displacement of U.S. workers. The annual cap for H-1B visas is 65,000, with an additional 20,000 for those with master's degrees or higher.
