## Article summary
The U.S. Justice Department has released tens of thousands of new documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, with this latest batch including multiple mentions of President Donald Trump. While the release is the most voluminous to date and follows public calls for transparency, it has added little new revelatory information. Many references to Trump were found in news clippings, but one email from a prosecutor highlighted that Trump had flown on Epstein's private jet more frequently than previously known during the 1990s. The Justice Department clarified that some documents contain untrue claims about Trump made before the 2020 election and that one purported letter from Epstein was confirmed as fake. The documents also indicate that Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida club, received a subpoena in 2021 for employment records. Trump himself has described the release of these files as a distraction from Republican achievements. Other high-profile individuals, including former President Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson, also appear in the released files, though their inclusion does not imply wrongdoing. The documents also shed light on past negotiations for testimony from Prince Andrew, who has denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. The release, mandated by law, is being conducted in stages to protect victims, but some have called for greater transparency, while officials face accusations of withholding information.
