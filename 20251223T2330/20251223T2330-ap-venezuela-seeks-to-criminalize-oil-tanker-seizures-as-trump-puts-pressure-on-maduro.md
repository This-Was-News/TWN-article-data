## Article summary
Venezuela's ruling party-controlled National Assembly has approved a new law that criminalizes actions threatening maritime navigation and trade, including the seizure of oil tankers. This legislative action follows the recent seizure of two Venezuelan oil tankers by U.S. forces in international waters. These seizures are part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The new law, awaiting Maduro's signature, proposes fines and prison sentences of up to 20 years for involvement in piracy, blockades, or other illegal acts against commercial entities operating with Venezuela. The bill also mandates the executive branch to develop protections for entities doing business with Venezuela in cases of piracy or blockades. The U.S. Coast Guard and Navy have recently seized two tankers, the Centuries and the Skipper, which were allegedly involved in transporting sanctioned cargo. President Trump has previously stated the U.S. would blockade Venezuela and has asserted that Maduro's time in power is limited. Venezuela's political opposition, including María Corina Machado, has expressed support for the U.S. policy of seizing tankers.
