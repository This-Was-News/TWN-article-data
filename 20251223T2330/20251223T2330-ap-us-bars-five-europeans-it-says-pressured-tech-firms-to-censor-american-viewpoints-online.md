## Article summary
The U.S. State Department has announced a ban on five European individuals accused of pressuring American tech companies to censor viewpoints online. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that these actions constitute "extraterritorial censorship" and will no longer be tolerated by the Trump administration. While Rubio did not initially name the individuals, they were later identified by Sarah Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy. The targeted individuals include leaders of organizations focused on digital hate and a former EU commissioner. This measure is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to combat foreign influence over online speech, utilizing immigration law. The affected individuals are generally barred from entering the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Officials indicated that the list of banned individuals could expand if similar foreign actions persist. This policy is distinct from other visa restriction measures implemented this year, which have targeted visitors from certain regions and the Palestinian Authority.
