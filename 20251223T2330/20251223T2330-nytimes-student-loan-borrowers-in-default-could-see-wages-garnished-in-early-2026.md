## Article summary
Starting in early 2026, the Department of Education will begin garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers who are in default. This enforcement effort follows the end of a pandemic-era pause on student loan repayments in May, which also allowed for the withholding of tax refunds and other federal payments. Approximately 1,000 borrowers will receive notices in early January, with the number increasing monthly. The government can withhold up to 15% of a borrower's take-home pay, and borrowers are typically notified 30 days before seizure begins. This action comes at a time when many Americans are already facing financial strain due to the rising cost of living. Experts suggest that wage garnishment will disproportionately affect lower-income families. Millions of borrowers are currently in default or nearing missed payments, and their credit scores are expected to plummet. While the government had garnished wages before the pandemic, the current collections pause may make these deductions more shocking for those who have not made payments for years. It is important to note that options exist to reorganize defaulted loans, such as consolidation or rehabilitation, and income-driven repayment plans that may be more manageable than garnishment.
