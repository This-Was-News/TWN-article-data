## Article summary
The Supreme Court has refused to allow President Trump to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, a decision hailed by Illinois officials as a victory for democracy and a curb on executive overreach. In a separate development, Governor Jeff Landry of Louisiana announced that National Guard troops will be deployed to New Orleans to address crime, a move that has federal backing for expense coverage. The Trump administration is intensifying its pressure on Venezuela, with a significant military buildup in the Caribbean and aggressive actions against tankers exporting Venezuelan crude, which has disrupted the country's oil industry. The Justice Department is suing Illinois over a new state law that limits federal immigration enforcement, which the department argues is an illegal attempt to regulate federal operations and endangers immigration agents. The Trump administration has also ordered nearly 30 U.S. ambassadors, appointed by the Biden administration, to return to the United States, a move described as unprecedented by a union representing career diplomats. President Trump announced plans to build a new "Trump class" of warships, envisioned as a "golden fleet" for the Navy, intended to surpass current vessels in size and capability. The administration has delayed imposing additional tariffs on Chinese semiconductors, concluding a trade investigation that found China's dominance disadvantaged U.S. companies, but opted for a phased approach to tariffs. Student loan borrowers in default will face wage garnishment starting in January, as the administration steps up repayment enforcement efforts. Ukraine's forces have withdrawn from the eastern town of Siversk, a move that could impact peace talks with Russia, while President Zelensky stated that a U.S.-backed peace plan is solid but faces obstacles. The Trump administration has also delayed tariffs on Chinese semiconductors, citing concerns about China's dominance but opting for a phased tariff implementation to maintain trade truce.
