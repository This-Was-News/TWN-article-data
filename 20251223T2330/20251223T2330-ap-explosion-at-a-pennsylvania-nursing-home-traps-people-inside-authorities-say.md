## Article summary
An explosion at the Bristol Health & Rehab Center nursing home in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, has caused a partial building collapse, with authorities reporting injuries and people potentially trapped inside. The incident occurred shortly after a utility crew responded to reports of a gas leak. Emergency responders, including fire trucks and ambulances from across the region, were dispatched to the scene. While injuries have been confirmed, the extent of casualties, including fatalities, remains unknown. Officials are working to evacuate residents and establish a reunification center at a local high school. The cause of the explosion is under investigation, though it is being described as a potential gas explosion. The nursing home, previously known as Silver Lake Healthcare Center, is located about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. Saber Healthcare Group, the owner, is cooperating with emergency authorities. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about the facility, which has previously received poor ratings for health inspections, despite a recent clean fire safety inspection.
