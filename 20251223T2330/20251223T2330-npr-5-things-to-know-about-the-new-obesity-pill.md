## Article summary
Pill versions of popular obesity drugs, like Wegovy, are now available, offering a more convenient alternative to weekly injections. Novo Nordisk's semaglutide pill, an oral version of Wegovy, has received FDA approval and will launch in early January with a cash price of $149 per month. This pill contains the same active ingredient as Wegovy and Ozempic but in a higher dose. Another competitor, Eli Lilly, is developing an obesity pill called orforglipron, which uses a different ingredient and has no food or water restrictions. While both pills have shown effectiveness in weight loss, similar to their injectable counterparts, they also carry comparable side effects like nausea and diarrhea. These new pills are expected to be more affordable than the injectable versions, which can cost over $1,000 per month, potentially improving access for millions. The FDA is also reviewing Eli Lilly's orforglipron, with a decision expected within months. Furthermore, drugmakers are researching next-generation obesity drugs that could be even more effective, with several compounds in late-stage clinical trials. Pfizer has also acquired Metsera, a company developing obesity drugs, indicating continued innovation in the field.
