## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against President Trump, declining to reinstate his authority to deploy National Guard troops to Illinois without the governor's consent. The administration had argued for federalizing the National Guard to protect immigration agents from violence in Chicago. However, two lower courts had previously ruled against Trump's claim that the protests constituted a rebellion against the U.S. government. The Supreme Court's unsigned opinion stated that the government failed to identify sufficient authority for the military to execute laws in Illinois and did not adequately explain why the situation warranted an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act. This decision, while not setting a precedent, offers clarity on the president's power regarding federal military resources. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented, arguing the court overstepped its authority. The case originated from Trump's federalization of the Illinois National Guard in October, which was opposed by Governor JB Pritzker. Similar legal challenges to National Guard deployments have occurred in Oregon and California, with varying outcomes. In Washington D.C., a federal judge ordered an end to a deployment, but a subsequent attack on National Guard members led to an increase in troops.
