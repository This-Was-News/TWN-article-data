## Article summary
The Department of Justice has released a new batch of nearly 30,000 files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, which include hundreds of references to President Trump. While Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing, the files detail his past friendship with Epstein and document Trump flying on Epstein's private jet multiple times in the 1990s. One prosecutor noted Trump was a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, with one flight reportedly including only Trump, Epstein, and a young woman. The Justice Department stated that the latest files contain "untrue or sensationalist claims" about Trump. President Trump has called the release of the Epstein files a distraction and an attempt to deflect from Republican successes, arguing they unfairly implicate innocent people. The files also contained a letter purportedly from Epstein to Larry Nassar mentioning "our president shares our love of young, nubile girls," but the Justice Department has since confirmed this letter is fake due to inconsistencies. The DOJ is continuing to release files as required by law, emphasizing that not all documents contain factual information. A subpoena for employment records at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club was also included in the released documents.
