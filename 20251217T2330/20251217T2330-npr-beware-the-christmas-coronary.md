## Article summary
The holiday season sees a significant increase in heart attacks and strokes, with cardiac deaths peaking between Christmas and New Year's. This "Christmas Coronary" effect is attributed to a convergence of factors that act as a tipping point. Contributing elements include colder weather, winter infections, disrupted routines, and heightened holiday stress. Indulging in rich foods and alcohol can strain the heart, while excess sodium intake raises blood pressure. Acute stress can trigger a fight-or-flight response, spiking blood pressure and further burdening the cardiovascular system. Classic heart attack symptoms include sudden chest pressure or shortness of breath, though women may experience more subtle signs like lightheadedness or pain in the jaw, neck, or back. Stroke symptoms can be identified using the FAST mnemonic: facial drooping, arm or leg weakness, or speech difficulty. During the holidays, healthy habits like taking prescribed medications can be overlooked, emphasizing the importance of packing enough for travel. Physicians urge people not to delay or avoid seeking emergency care if they suspect a heart attack or stroke, as prompt treatment is crucial for recovery and preventing long-term complications.
