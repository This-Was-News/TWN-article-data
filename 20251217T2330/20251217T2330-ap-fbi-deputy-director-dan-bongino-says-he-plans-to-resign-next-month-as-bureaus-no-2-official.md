## Article summary
FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino announced his planned resignation for next month, concluding a brief and contentious period in the role. Bongino's tenure was marked by clashes with the Justice Department over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and the need to reconcile his past as a popular podcast host with his current law enforcement duties. His departure, anticipated by many, is one of the most high-profile resignations during the Trump administration. Bongino, who previously served as a New York City police officer and Secret Service agent, was an unconventional choice for the FBI's second-in-command position, as it typically goes to a career agent. He was appointed to the role by President Trump after years of hosting a conservative podcast where he often criticized FBI leadership and promoted conspiracy theories. Upon assuming his position, Bongino faced pressure from Trump's base to enact reforms and uncover alleged hidden truths. He publicly stated that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide, contradicting his earlier speculations. Bongino also addressed his past theories about the Jan. 6 pipe bombs, explaining that his current role requires him to base investigations on facts, not past opinions expressed on his podcast.
