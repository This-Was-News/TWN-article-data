## Article summary
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests near schools are causing fear and disruption among families and educators. Incidents include officers blocking school entrances, deploying tear gas nearby, and detaining parents during school drop-off or pick-up times. These actions have led to increased anxiety for children, who worry about their safety and the presence of their teachers. Educators report that enforcement activities make it difficult for students to focus on learning and feel secure on campus. Parents have expressed concerns about their children witnessing arrests and the potential for their own detention. In response to community concerns, some senators have urged the administration to halt enforcement activities within 1,000 feet of school properties. While Trump administration officials state that ICE does not target schools and arrests are made to protect students or apprehend dangerous individuals, critics argue these operations instill fear and disrupt the educational environment. Some schools have seen drops in attendance and increased student wellness programs, while parents have organized patrols during school arrival and dismissal times. The fear extends to students themselves, who worry about being detained in a place they should feel safe.
