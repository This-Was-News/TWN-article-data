## Article summary
Thousands of dinosaur tracks, estimated to be 210 million years old, have been discovered on dolomite walls in Italy's Stelvio National Park, near venues for the upcoming Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. The prints, found on steep Alpine rock faces between Livigno and Bormio, represent the largest and one of the richest sites of dinosaur tracks in the Alps and the world. Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrara stumbled upon the extensive collection of tracks, which show imprints of toes and claws, while exploring the Fraele Valley. Scientists believe the tracks were made by herbivorous prosauropod dinosaurs during the Late Triassic period when the area was tidal flats. This discovery marks the first time dinosaur tracks have been found in the Lombardy region and north of the Insubric Line, a significant geological boundary. While much remains unknown about prosauropods, Italian officials hope this find will provide new insights into the planet's history. The remote location of the tracks means researchers will utilize drones and remote sensing for further study, with public access not immediately planned.
