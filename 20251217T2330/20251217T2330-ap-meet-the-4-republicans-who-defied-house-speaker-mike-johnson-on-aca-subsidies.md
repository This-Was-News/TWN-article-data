## Article summary
Four moderate House Republicans from swing districts have defied House Speaker Mike Johnson by signing a Democratic petition to force a vote on extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) health care subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year. These Republicans, representing districts in Pennsylvania and New York, are considered key targets for Democrats in the upcoming midterms. Their decision comes after House Republican leadership advanced a health care bill that does not address the rising premiums. Speaker Johnson acknowledged that the party's narrow majority gives a small group of members significant influence. The four defectors are Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who has a history of bipartisan efforts; Rep. Ryan Mackenzie of Pennsylvania, who previously faced a challenger shortly after voting for the House budget bill; Rep. Robert Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, a freshman who won by a slim margin and has already hosted President Trump for a campaign-style event; and Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, a moderate who has actively engaged with constituents through town halls. These representatives are prioritizing the concerns of their constituents regarding health care affordability over strict party-line adherence.
