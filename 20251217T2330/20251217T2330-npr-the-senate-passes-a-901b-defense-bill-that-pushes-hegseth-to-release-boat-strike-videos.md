## Article summary
The Senate has passed a $901 billion defense bill that includes a 3.8% pay raise for troops and reflects a compromise between Congress and the Pentagon. The legislation pushes back on Pentagon decisions by demanding more information on strikes against alleged drug boats near Venezuela and requires U.S. troop levels in Europe to remain at current levels, while also sending military aid to Ukraine. The bill codifies many of President Trump's executive orders, including eliminating diversity and inclusion efforts in the military and granting emergency military powers at the U.S. border. It also enhances congressional oversight and overhauls Pentagon weapon procurement to outpace China. A point of contention arose over a waiver allowing military aircraft to operate without broadcasting their precise location, which was linked to a fatal midair collision. The bill threatens to withhold a quarter of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's travel budget until he provides video of the strikes near Venezuela. Lawmakers are also concerned about the Trump administration's reorientation of focus away from Europe and towards Central and South America. The legislation repeals the authorizations for the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 1991 Gulf War, signaling a potential reclamation of Congress's war powers. Additionally, it permanently lifts U.S. sanctions on Syria to aid in the country's reconstruction and the establishment of democracy.
