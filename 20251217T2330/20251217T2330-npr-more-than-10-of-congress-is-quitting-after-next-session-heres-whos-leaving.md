## Article summary
As of December 17, 2025, over 10% of Congress, totaling 54 members (10 senators and 44 House members), have announced they will not seek reelection in 2026. This significant number of departures is attributed to factors including redistricting, retirements, and lawmakers pursuing different political offices. Notable figures retiring include California Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell. Other lawmakers are running for governor, with 12 House members and three senators vying for the position. The upcoming 2026 midterms are on pace for record departures during the Trump era, with over 140 lawmakers having retired between 2017 and 2024. Redistricting efforts in states like Texas and California are also influencing these decisions, with new maps potentially forcing incumbents into challenging primaries or encouraging retirements. The trend of early announcements sets a modern record for this far in advance of an election. Many older Democrats are also choosing to retire, making way for younger generations. The high turnover includes the most Senate changes since 2012.
