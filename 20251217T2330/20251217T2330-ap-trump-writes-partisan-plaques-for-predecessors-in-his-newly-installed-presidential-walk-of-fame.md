## Article summary
President Donald Trump has installed partisan and subjective plaques in the White House's Presidential Walk of Fame, a walkway he previously created. These plaques, featuring Trumpian language, offer his personal interpretations of past presidents' legacies. Joe Biden's plaque repeats false claims about the 2020 election and labels him the "worst president in American history." Barack Obama is described as one of the most divisive political figures, while George W. Bush is criticized for starting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump himself wrote many of these descriptions. This initiative follows Trump's earlier decision to replace Biden's portrait with an autopen image. The display is positioned to allow Trump to guide guests through his historical narrative. An introductory plaque suggests the Walk of Fame is intended to be a lasting tribute to America's greatness.
