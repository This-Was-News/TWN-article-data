## Article summary
In frigid Minnesota, immigration agents and protesters clashed during a standoff at a house under construction. Two men sought refuge on the roof in subzero temperatures, while dozens of activists arrived to support them and confront federal agents. This incident is part of a larger immigration crackdown in Minnesota, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, initiated by the Trump administration. Activists have intensified efforts to disrupt ICE operations, viewing them as attempts to terrorize and profile immigrant communities, particularly those of Somali descent. Governor Tim Walz has criticized the federal actions, citing concerns of racial profiling and chaotic operations. Several tense encounters have occurred recently, including the detention of a U.S. citizen and the arrest of a Somali immigrant who was also a citizen. A separate incident involved a Nigerian man whose student visa expired, leading to a car chase and subsequent arrests. Immigration lawyers argue that many detained individuals lack criminal histories beyond immigration violations. Protesters have employed tactics like gathering outside hotels and following ICE vehicles to hinder enforcement. During the Chanhassen standoff, activists believed agents were targeting Latino construction workers based on appearance. ICE later stated they were pursuing an individual convicted of disorderly conduct who was unlawfully in the country. The standoff ended when agents eventually departed, and the remaining man on the roof was helped down by protesters and taken away.
