## Article summary
President Trump is set to deliver a primetime address to the nation amid a dip in his approval ratings and growing economic concerns among Americans. His approval rating has fallen below 40 percent, with 45% of Americans identifying rising prices as their primary economic worry. This comes after Democrats' focus on affordability was seen as a key factor in their recent electoral victories. Despite Trump's efforts to promote his economic policies, including promising tax returns and "Trump accounts," his characterization of the economy as "A+++++" has been criticized as out of touch. The upcoming address is viewed as an opportunity for Trump to regain control of the economic narrative, though the White House indicates it will also cover his "historic accomplishments" and future policies. Potential topics include border security and lower gas prices. Recent polling shows a new low in approval for Trump's economic handling. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has noted that tariffs are contributing to inflation in goods. Trump is scheduled to speak directly to voters again on Friday in North Carolina.
