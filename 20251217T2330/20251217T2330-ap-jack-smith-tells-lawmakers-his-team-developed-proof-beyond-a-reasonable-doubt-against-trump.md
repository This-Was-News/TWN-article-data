## Article summary
Former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith informed lawmakers that his team had gathered sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump had criminally conspired to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith also stated that investigators had amassed strong evidence that Trump illegally kept classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructed efforts to retrieve them. He emphasized that his decisions were based on facts and law, not on Trump's political status, and that he would prosecute any former president under similar circumstances, regardless of party affiliation. This testimony was provided during a closed-door deposition before the House Judiciary Committee, which was investigating the DOJ's inquiries into Trump. Smith's lawyers asserted that he cooperated with the subpoena and had previously offered to testify publicly, an offer they claim was rejected by Republicans. Democrats present at the deposition suggested that public testimony would have been "devastating" to Trump and his allies involved in the January 6th Capitol riot. Republicans, meanwhile, characterized the investigations as politically motivated. The deposition occurred amidst broader efforts by Trump allies to discredit the investigations, including the release of FBI emails concerning the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. Smith, appointed in 2022, oversaw investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the election and his handling of classified documents. While charges were filed, the cases were later dropped after Trump's election, citing legal opinions against indicting a sitting president.
