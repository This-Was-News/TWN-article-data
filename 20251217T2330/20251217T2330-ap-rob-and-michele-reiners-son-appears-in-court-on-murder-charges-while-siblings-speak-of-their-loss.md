## Article summary
Nick Reiner, 32, made his first court appearance in Los Angeles, facing two counts of first-degree murder in the killings of his parents, actor-director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner. He appeared in shackles and a suicide prevention smock, and his arraignment was postponed. Prosecutors have added special circumstances of multiple murders and the use of a dangerous weapon. The LA County Medical Examiner confirmed the cause of death for both victims was multiple sharp force injuries. Nick Reiner's attorney urged caution and a lack of rush to judgment. His siblings, Jake and Romy Reiner, released a statement expressing their "unimaginable pain" and describing their parents as "best friends." Close friends of the couple, including Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, have also paid tribute. Authorities have not yet revealed a motive for the killings, and it remains undecided whether the death penalty will be sought.
