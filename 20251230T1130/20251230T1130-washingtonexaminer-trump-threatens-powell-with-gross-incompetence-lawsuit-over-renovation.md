## Article summary
President Donald Trump is considering a lawsuit against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, alleging gross incompetence. The lawsuit would stem from the escalating costs and delays associated with renovating the Federal Reserve headquarters. Trump criticized the project, stating that the Fed is "way over budget" and that the construction costs per square foot are the highest in the world. He contrasted these costs with those of building "gorgeous monuments." Trump has previously been a frequent critic of Powell, primarily for his stance on interest rates, but has not taken concrete actions against him until now. Despite Trump's persistent attacks, Powell maintains a moderate approval rating among the public. A recent poll indicated that Powell has the highest approval rating of any national figure, though it stands at 44%.
