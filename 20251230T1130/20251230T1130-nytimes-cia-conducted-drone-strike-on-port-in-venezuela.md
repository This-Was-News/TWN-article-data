## Article summary
The C.I.A. executed a drone strike on a port facility in Venezuela last week, marking a significant escalation in the Trump administration's pressure campaign against the Maduro government. The target was a dock believed to be used by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua for storing and preparing narcotics for transport. No casualties were reported as the dock was unoccupied at the time of the strike. President Trump confirmed U.S. responsibility for the operation, describing it as a successful strike on an area used for loading drug-carrying boats. While the Venezuelan interior minister denounced "imperial madness," the government did not directly comment on the strike. This operation is the first known American strike inside Venezuela, previously limited to actions in international waters like intercepting drug-trafficking boats and seizing oil tankers. The intensifying campaign targets both the Maduro government and Tren de Aragua, though intelligence agencies have questioned alleged ties between them. The strike follows President Trump's earlier authorization of C.I.A. operations in Venezuela and comes after a period where drone strikes were primarily conducted by the U.S. military, not the C.I.A.
