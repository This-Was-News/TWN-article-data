## Article summary
A potent winter storm is expected to bring blizzard-like conditions, heavy snow, and strong winds to the Great Lakes and Northeast regions. This follows a previous bomb cyclone that caused widespread power outages. Thousands of flights were already delayed or canceled over the weekend due to snow. The new storm is predicted to bring quick bursts of heavy snow and gusty winds, with whiteout conditions anticipated in parts of New York. In Michigan, over 153,000 customers were without power. The Upper Peninsula received up to two feet of snow, with more expected. Fierce winds on Lake Erie caused water to surge, exposing normally submerged lakebed, including old car and snowmobile wrecks. Dangerous wind chills were recorded as low as minus 30 F in North Dakota and Minnesota. In Iowa, blizzard conditions eased, but high winds continued to cause travel hazards, leading to road closures and at least one fatality. Meanwhile, Southern California is bracing for strong Santa Ana winds, raising concerns about downed trees due to saturated soil. Additional storms are forecast for the West Coast, with potential rain on New Year's Day.
