## Article summary
Krista Tippett, host of the "On Being" radio show, suggests embracing questions rather than New Year's resolutions for 2026. Drawing inspiration from poet Rainer Maria Rilke, she advises patience with unresolved issues, emphasizing that important questions lead to a life lived in accordance with their answers. Tippett proposes questions like "What in the way I'm living now and working now depletes me, and what is life giving… and are the things I'm struggling with now the right things for me to be struggling with?" to navigate significant life changes. She believes that in times of crisis, sitting with a question can be transformative, while rushing to an answer can diminish the gravity of uncertainty. Tippett encourages setting an open-ended question as a companion for the year, such as "What amidst all that is breaking wants to be born that I can attend to?" The goal is not to find immediate answers but to observe what emerges and to allow the question itself to evolve. This approach treats time not as a pressure for answers, but as a space for emergence and discovery, fostering peace by living with unresolved questions rather than striving for premature conclusions.
