## Article summary
Saudi Arabia has bombed the Yemeni port city of Mukalla, claiming it was in response to a weapons shipment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) destined for separatist forces. The kingdom issued a stern warning to Abu Dhabi, labeling the UAE's actions as "extremely dangerous." This incident has heightened tensions and threatened to create a new front in Yemen's decade-long civil war, potentially pitting allies against each other. The conflict strains the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, neighboring nations with competing regional interests. The UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, which has been advancing in southern Yemen, declared a state of emergency and demanded Emirati forces withdraw within 24 hours. The strike occurred after the Council had recently seized control of the Hadramout governorate, where Mukalla is located. This confrontation is seen as the most serious between Saudi Arabia and the UAE in decades, occurring amidst broader regional instability, including Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and conflict in Sudan. The Council's actions, including flying the flag of South Yemen, signal a growing push for secession. The UAE has not officially responded to the accusations, but its state-linked newspaper reported on the strike.
