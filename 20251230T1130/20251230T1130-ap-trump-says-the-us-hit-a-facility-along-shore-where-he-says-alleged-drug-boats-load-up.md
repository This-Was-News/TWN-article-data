## Article summary
President Donald Trump has hinted that the U.S. has struck a dock facility in South America as part of an intensified campaign against alleged drug smuggling. Trump stated that the U.S. hit a facility where boats accused of carrying drugs load up, and that this area is "no longer around." This suggests a move towards shore strikes, expanding beyond the military's previous actions on boats in international waters. The U.S. military also conducted another strike on a drug-smuggling boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean, resulting in two deaths. These actions are part of a broader effort to disrupt drug flow into the United States, with the Trump administration reporting at least 107 deaths in 30 strikes since September. Trump, however, declined to specify the exact location or the agency responsible for the strike. While the Pentagon typically announces such strikes, no official announcement regarding a facility strike has been made. The White House and Venezuela's government have not yet provided further comment. Trump has previously indicated intentions for land strikes in South America and authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela. The U.S. has also increased its military presence and seized vessels in the region. The administration claims these operations are against drug cartels, while Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro views them as a ploy to oust him from power.
