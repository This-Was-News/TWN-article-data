## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court's 2025 decisions demonstrated a strong adherence to originalist interpretations of the Constitution. Key rulings included limiting nationwide injunctions, allowing Tennessee to prohibit hormone therapy for minors, and upholding religious liberty protections. In U.S. v. Skrmetti, the court permitted states to ban puberty blockers and hormones for minors, emphasizing legislative authority over complex medical decisions. The ruling in Trump v. CASA restricted federal judges from issuing universal injunctions, aiming to reduce frivolous lawsuits against the government. The court also upheld a Texas law requiring age verification for accessing sensitive online content in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, prioritizing the protection of minors. Religious freedom was reinforced in Mahmoud v. Taylor, allowing parents to opt children out of gender identity and sexual orientation materials, and in a unanimous decision supporting a Catholic charity's religious tax exemption. These decisions reflect a shift towards judicial restraint and originalist influence, particularly since Justice Amy Coney Barrett's appointment. Looking ahead to 2026, the court is expected to further clarify originalist positions on executive branch authority in cases concerning presidential power to fire officials and impose tariffs.
