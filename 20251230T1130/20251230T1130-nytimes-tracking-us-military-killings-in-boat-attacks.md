## Article summary
Since September 2nd, the U.S. military has been conducting boat strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, targeting vessels the Trump administration claims are involved in drug smuggling. These actions have resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, marking a significant shift from previous U.S. policy. Historically, maritime drug smuggling has been handled as a law enforcement issue by the Coast Guard, with interdictions and arrests for prosecution. However, legal experts argue these military strikes constitute illegal extrajudicial killings, as the military is not authorized to deliberately target civilians, even suspected criminals, who do not pose an immediate violent threat. The White House maintains the killings are lawful, with President Trump declaring an armed conflict with drug cartels and classifying boat crews as combatants. The administration has linked these actions to the high number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S., although the primary cause of recent overdoses is fentanyl from Mexico, not cocaine from South America. The New York Times is monitoring these boat strikes, with casualty figures and locations reported by administration officials, though not independently verified by the Times.
