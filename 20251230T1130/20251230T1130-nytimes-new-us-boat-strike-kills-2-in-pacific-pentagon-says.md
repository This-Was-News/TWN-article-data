## Article summary
A U.S. military strike in the eastern Pacific on Monday killed two individuals suspected of narcotics trafficking, bringing the total death toll in the U.S. campaign to at least 107. This strike, directed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, targeted a boat on a known narco-trafficking route. The U.S. Southern Command announced the strike, though The New York Times could not independently verify the details. This marks the 30th announced U.S. military attack since early September, following President Trump's claims of a strike on a coastal site related to drugs and Venezuela. These strikes in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean have raised concerns among legal experts and members of Congress, who view them as potential extrajudicial killings or war crimes. The recent military actions are part of a broader U.S. effort to pressure Venezuela, involving over 15,000 troops and a dozen warships in the Caribbean. The U.S. has also implemented a partial blockade of oil tankers to and from Venezuela. President Trump previously suggested a strike on a Venezuelan site involved in drug trafficking, describing a "major explosion" in a loading area for drug boats. He provided limited details regarding the location, method, or perpetrators of this alleged attack.
