## Article summary
A recent survey by EdChoice reveals that a majority of parents believe teaching civil debate and discourse skills in high school is important. Specifically, 65% of school parents and 53% of all Americans consider these skills very important for high school students. The survey indicates a preference for integrating debate skills into existing core subjects like English, math, and science, rather than establishing them as a standalone graduation requirement. Nearly 60% of parents feel their children's schools are doing an excellent or very good job teaching durable skills, which include communication, critical thinking, and teamwork. Most parents view the teaching of these skills as a shared responsibility between schools and families. The emphasis on durable skills also significantly influences parents' school choice decisions, with over 80% stating it's crucial for schools to prioritize them. The survey also highlighted strong parental support for education savings accounts and 529 plans for K-12 education. Additionally, a majority of parents believe their child should be allowed to have a cellphone at school, though classroom use is less supported. The survey was conducted by EdChoice and Morning Consult, sampling 2,250 adults and 1,300 school parents monthly from August to November.
