## Article summary
The U.S. military conducted its 30th strike against alleged drug boats, resulting in the deaths of two suspected traffickers. War Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the lethal kinetic strike on a vessel in the Eastern Pacific, which was confirmed to be involved in narco-trafficking operations. The strike, which obliterated the vessel, did not harm any U.S. military personnel. This action underscores the Trump administration's continued aggressive stance against drug trafficking and the Maduro government in Venezuela. Since the campaign began on September 2nd, the total death toll in the U.S. effort against drug boats has reached 109. President Trump initiated this militarized campaign, which has faced controversy, including reports of a follow-up strike to eliminate survivors of an initial strike. The administration has defended its actions, dismissing criticism as fabricated reporting. Trump has stated that each boat strike saves an estimated 25,000 American lives and has considered extending lethal force to other drug-producing countries like Mexico and Colombia.
