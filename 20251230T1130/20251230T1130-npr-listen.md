## Article summary
Gen Z and younger millennials, highly climate literate, are experiencing significant worry about their future, extending to concerns about having children. This "reproductive anxiety" stems from the escalating climate crisis and the likelihood of worsening climate-related disasters. The NPR podcast "Short Wave" addresses this issue in an encore episode of "Nature Quest." The episode features journalist Alessandra Ram, who recently had a child, discussing the future for her newborn and how to raise the next generation sustainably. Experts offer guidance on navigating the decision of whether to have children in an uncertain future. The podcast also provides a list of recommended resources, including action guides, mental health tools, community hubs, books on climate anxiety and parenting, and relevant research papers. These resources aim to help individuals cope with climate emotions and take action. The episode encourages listeners with questions about local environmental changes to submit voice memos. Listeners can access "Short Wave" episodes sponsor-free through NPR+.
