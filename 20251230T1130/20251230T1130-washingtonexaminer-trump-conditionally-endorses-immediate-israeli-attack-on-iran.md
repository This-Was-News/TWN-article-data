## Article summary
President Donald Trump has conditionally endorsed Israel's right to strike Iran if the country continues its nuclear weapons program or missile development. Speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida, Trump stated that immediate strikes would be justified under such circumstances. He expressed concern over reports of Iran rebuilding its nuclear and missile capabilities, suggesting the U.S. would act swiftly if evidence confirmed this. The meeting at Mar-a-Lago also focused on the second phase of a Gaza ceasefire, which includes amnesty for Hamas members who disarm and cede power to a multinational peace force. Trump warned Hamas that they would face severe consequences if they failed to disarm within a short timeframe. Prime Minister Netanyahu described the summit as highly productive and announced that Trump would receive the prestigious Israel Prize for his peace negotiation efforts in Gaza, marking the first time the award would be given to a non-Israeli.
