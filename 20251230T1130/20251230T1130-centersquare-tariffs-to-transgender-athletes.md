## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court is set to address several high-profile cases in 2026, impacting areas from transgender athletes' participation in sports to presidential powers. Key cases include challenges to President Trump's authority to levy tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, potentially affecting international trade. Redistricting efforts will be scrutinized in Louisiana v. Callais, questioning the legality of state-drawn congressional maps and their impact on minority voting rights under the 14th and 15th Amendments. The interpretation of the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship will be examined in Trump v. Barbara, challenging an executive order that denies citizenship to children of undocumented or temporary resident parents. Two significant cases, Little v. Hecox and B.P.J. v. West Virginia, will determine if limiting transgender individuals' participation in women's sports based on biological sex violates the equal protection clause. The court will also revisit gun rights in U.S. v. Hemani and Wolford v. Lopez, which could expand access to firearms. Trump v. Slaughter will decide the extent of the president's authority to fire members of federal executive boards, potentially overturning a long-standing precedent. Finally, Chevron Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish will address the extent to which state courts can litigate against oil companies for environmental damage, even with federal permits.
