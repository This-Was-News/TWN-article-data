## Article summary
Despite projecting an image of constant energy, President Trump, at 79, is facing the realities of aging in office. While allies praise his stamina, he has been observed dozing off during events. As the oldest person elected president, Trump often compares himself to President Biden, who at 82 was the oldest to hold the office. Biden's aides managed his public appearances to conceal his frailty, a tactic Trump seems eager to contrast with his own perceived vigor. Trump has even displayed a photo of an autopen in place of Biden's portrait, frequently criticizing Biden's sleeping habits and asserting his own lack of sleep. This narrative of perpetual energy serves to preempt criticisms about his age, even as the physical demands of the presidency take their toll.
