## Article summary
Tyson Foods has announced plans to close its beef plant in Lexington, Nebraska, a move expected to significantly impact the town of 11,000 residents, as the plant employs nearly a third of its population. This closure, along with a reduction in shifts at a Texas plant, will decrease national beef processing capacity by 7-9%. While consumers may not see immediate price changes, long-term beef prices could rise further due to factors like drought and tariffs, unless ranchers increase cattle production. However, ranchers face low incentives due to high costs and falling prices, exacerbated by potential increases in beef imports from Brazil, a move encouraged by reduced tariffs. The Lexington plant, which opened in 1990 and was later acquired by Tyson, revitalized the town by attracting immigrant workers and nearly doubling its population. Its closure in January will have ripple effects on local businesses and housing investments, with Tyson offering some workers relocation opportunities. The U.S. cattle industry is experiencing a lack of confidence, making ranchers hesitant to invest in rebuilding herds. Tyson Foods is facing substantial losses in its beef business, with an expected loss of over $600 million this year, attributed partly to excess capacity in the meat industry and the plant's potential lack of technological advancement compared to newer facilities.
