## Article summary
Gramma, a Galápagos tortoise at the San Diego Zoo, has died at the estimated age of 141. She was born around 1884, witnessing significant historical events and the tenure of over 20 U.S. presidents. Gramma arrived at the San Diego Zoo in 1928 from the Bronx Zoo. Her longevity is attributed to the slow biological processes of her species. Galápagos tortoises have a slow metabolism, which contributes to their exceptionally long lifespans, with some individuals living over 100 years. Gramma was described as a "sweet and shy tortoise" and an "ambassador for reptile conservation." Her ability to survive for so long is a testament to her species' unique physiological adaptations, including the capacity to clean toxic compounds from their bodies. The article also touches upon the evolutionary history of Galápagos tortoises, their arrival on the islands, and their physical characteristics. Gramma's life spanned a period from before the completion of the Washington Monument to the present day, highlighting the remarkable duration of her existence.
