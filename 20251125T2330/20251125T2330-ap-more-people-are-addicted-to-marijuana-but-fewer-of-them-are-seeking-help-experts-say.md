## Article summary
Despite an increase in marijuana addiction, fewer individuals are seeking help, according to experts. Factors contributing to this trend include the widespread social acceptance of marijuana, more relaxed access, and the availability of high-potency cannabis products. Pot use among young adults has reached historic levels, with daily use surpassing daily drinking in recent years. This rise in use corresponds with an increase in cannabis use disorder, a condition affecting about 30% of users, characterized by cravings and negative life consequences. However, a pervasive belief that marijuana cannot cause addiction or significant problems contributes to a stigma around seeking treatment. Modern cannabis products are significantly more potent than in the past, with THC levels reaching 40% or more, compared to less than 5% in the 1960s. This increased potency, combined with easier access through state legalization, has led to a rise in emergency room visits for acute cannabis intoxication. Many people delay seeking help until marijuana use severely impacts multiple areas of their lives, if they seek help at all. Experts emphasize the importance of educating people about the potential harms of marijuana and creating an environment where individuals feel safe to ask for help managing their use.
