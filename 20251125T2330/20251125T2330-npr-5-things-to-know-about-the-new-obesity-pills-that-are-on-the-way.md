## Article summary
New obesity pills, offering an alternative to weekly injections like Wegovy, are nearing FDA approval. Two prominent contenders are from Novo Nordisk, using semaglutide, and Eli Lilly, developing a new compound called orforglipron. Unlike the injectables, these pills are designed for daily oral administration. Novo Nordisk's pill requires a specific absorption enhancer, SNAC, and must be taken on an empty stomach, while Eli Lilly's orforglipron has fewer restrictions. Clinical studies show significant weight loss with both, though semaglutide pills appear slightly more effective. A major anticipated benefit is a lower cost compared to injectables, potentially making obesity treatment more accessible. Novo Nordisk's pill is expected to be approved by year-end, with Eli Lilly following soon after. Both companies are also researching next-generation drugs for even greater efficacy, indicating a rapidly advancing field in obesity pharmacotherapy.
