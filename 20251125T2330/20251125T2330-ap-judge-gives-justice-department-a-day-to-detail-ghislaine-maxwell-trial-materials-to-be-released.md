## Article summary
A federal judge in Manhattan, Paul A. Engelmayer, has requested more detailed information from the Justice Department regarding its request to unseal records from the Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking case. The Justice Department seeks to release grand jury records, exhibits, and discovery materials, which were previously under secrecy orders. Judge Engelmayer has given the Justice Department until Wednesday at noon to provide a detailed description of the materials intended for public release, ensuring victims are adequately informed. Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence, while Jeffrey Epstein, her associate, died by suicide in jail in 2019. This unsealing request is part of the Justice Department's compliance with the recently passed Epstein Files Transparency Act. Victims and Maxwell's legal representatives have until December 3rd to respond to the unsealing request, with the government to reply by December 10th. Judge Engelmayer will then make a prompt decision. Another judge, Richard M. Berman, who previously presided over parts of the Epstein case, has set similar deadlines for responses to the unsealing request concerning Epstein's grand jury materials.
