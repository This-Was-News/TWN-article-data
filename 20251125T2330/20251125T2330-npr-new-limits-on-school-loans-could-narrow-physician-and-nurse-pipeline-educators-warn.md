## Article summary
New federal loan limits for medical and nursing students, set to take effect next July, are raising concerns among health educators about a potential reduction in the pipeline of future physicians and nurses. The "One Big Beautiful" legislation caps annual federal loan amounts for medical students at $50,000 and imposes stricter limits for nursing and public health fields. This could disproportionately affect students from lower-income backgrounds, potentially leading to a less diverse healthcare workforce. Adding to these concerns, a new regulation modifies the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, making it harder for health workers in high-need areas to have their student debt erased. These changes come in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that banned race considerations in admissions, which has already seen a drop in Black and Latino enrollment in medical schools. Experts warn that these policies could exacerbate existing physician shortages and reduce access to care in underserved communities. While proponents argue the limits will push down tuition costs, educators fear they will simply deter qualified students from pursuing health careers. The American Nurses Association president stated that limiting access to graduate education funding threatens patient care, especially in rural and underserved areas. A diverse healthcare workforce is linked to improved health outcomes, and these new policies may hinder efforts to achieve such representation. The Department of Education maintains that the loan caps are intended to drive down program costs, but many in education remain skeptical of their effectiveness in making healthcare professions more affordable and accessible.
