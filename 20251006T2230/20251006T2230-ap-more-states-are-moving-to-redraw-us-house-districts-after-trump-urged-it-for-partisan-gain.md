## Article summary
A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting is unfolding in state capitals, courtrooms, and ballots. President Donald Trump's call for Republican-led Texas to reshape districts for partisan gain sparked these efforts. Since then, California and Missouri have approved revised districts, with more states considering similar actions. Utah's Legislature endorsed an altered congressional map following a court order. U.S. House districts are typically redrawn once a decade, but some states allow more frequent changes. The stakes are high, as Democrats need to gain three seats in the 2026 elections to control the House. Legal challenges and voter approval processes are ongoing in several states. Republicans aim to secure more seats in Texas, Missouri, and Indiana, while Democrats seek advantages in California and Maryland. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Louisianas districts, and other states like Florida, Illinois, and New York are considering redistricting.
