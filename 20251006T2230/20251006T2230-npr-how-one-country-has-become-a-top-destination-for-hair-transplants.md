## Article summary
Istanbul has become a leading destination for hair transplants, attracting patients worldwide with lower costs and bundled travel packages. Dr. Mehmet Erdogan's Smile Hair Clinic in Istanbul treats around 5,000 patients annually, with a high success rate. Many patients, like Justin R. from California, choose Turkey for the significant cost savings compared to the U.S. The country's health tourism industry has boomed, with around 1 million people traveling for hair transplants in 2022, generating substantial economic gains. However, concerns have been raised about unlicensed clinics and potential medical risks. Social media has popularized hair transplants as a lifestyle upgrade, normalizing the procedure. While many patients report positive outcomes, experts caution about the importance of proper medical oversight and informed consent. Some, like psychologist Glen Jankowski, advocate for embracing hair loss as a natural part of life.
