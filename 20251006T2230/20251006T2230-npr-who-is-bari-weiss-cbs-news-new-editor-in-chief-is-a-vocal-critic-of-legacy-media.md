## Article summary
Bari Weiss, a 41-year-old journalist and entrepreneur, has been appointed as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. She previously co-founded The Free Press, a news site known for criticizing mainstream media and left-leaning 'woke' culture. Weiss left the New York Times in 2020 after controversy over publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton. She started The Free Press as a newsletter, which grew into a full-fledged media company. The Free Press is known for its investigations and commentaries on political and cultural issues, and it has a sizable following. Weiss will shape CBS News' editorial direction, aiming to appeal to right-leaning viewers. She has described herself as a 'radical centrist' and has been a vocal critic of progressive culture. Weiss's appointment is part of Paramount's vision to modernize content and connect with diverse audiences.
