## Article summary
Sen. Chris Van Hollen discusses the ongoing federal shutdown, emphasizing Senate Democrats' unity in their efforts to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies and limit President Trump's power. The shutdown persists as the Senate failed to pass either Republican or Democratic plans. Van Hollen warns of a 'ticking time bomb' with expiring ACA subsidies, which could significantly increase health premiums for millions. He also anticipates Maryland's resistance to the Trump administration's decisions, including potential lawsuits over withheld funds and canceled clean energy projects. Van Hollen asserts that Democrats aim to prevent 'lawless activity' by the president and address rising health care costs. He confirms Democrats' unity in opposing Trump's actions and their proposal includes safeguards against illegal withholding of funds. The interview highlights Democrats' efforts to reopen the government without granting Trump a 'blank check' and their plans to support litigation against the administration's actions.
