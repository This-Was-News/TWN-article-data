## Article summary
President Trump delivered a partisan speech to U.S. Navy sailors during a celebration of the Navy's 250th anniversary, blending political rhetoric with his role as commander in chief. He criticized the election, media, Democrats, and transgender policies, drawing mixed reactions from the young sailors. Trump's attempts to politicize the military have become more overt, especially as he deploys troops to U.S. cities like Chicago and Portland against local leaders' wishes. A federal judge blocked some of these deployments, emphasizing the importance of constitutional law over martial law. Trump also boasted about military strikes and troop deployments during his speech. Sailors were reminded of their oath to the Constitution and the military's nonpartisan tradition, which Trump has often disregarded. Some sailors expressed support for Trump, while others seemed uncomfortable with his political remarks. The event highlighted the tension between Trump's partisan politics and the military's traditional role. Despite the mixed reactions, Trump enjoyed the event, even dancing to YMCA before leaving.
