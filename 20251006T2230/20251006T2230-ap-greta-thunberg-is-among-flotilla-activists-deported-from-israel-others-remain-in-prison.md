## Article summary
Israeli authorities deported 171 activists, including Greta Thunberg, from a Gaza-bound aid flotilla to Greece and Slovakia. Thunberg, among those deported to Athens, criticized the mistreatment and abuses faced by activists and urged global action against the situation in Gaza. Israeli authorities denied mistreatment claims and genocide accusations, despite testimonies from activists alleging physical violence and humiliation. Over 470 participants were detained, with 150 still held in Ktziot prison, including Nelson Mandela's grandson. Some detainees are on hunger strike, demanding medical treatment. Israeli authorities maintain they respected detainees' rights, while activists reported differential treatment based on nationality. Governments of various countries are working to repatriate their citizens involved in the flotilla.
