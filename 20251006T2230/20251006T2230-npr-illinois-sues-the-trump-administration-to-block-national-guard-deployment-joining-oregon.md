## Article summary
Illinois and Chicago have filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of National Guard troops to the state, following a similar lawsuit by Oregon. The lawsuit argues that the administration can only federalize the National Guard in cases of invasion, rebellion, or when federal laws cannot be enforced, none of which apply. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized the move as an 'invasion' by Trump. The administration has claimed the troops are needed to protect federal property and agents amid ongoing protests. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members to Oregon, citing concerns over the administration's actions. The judge also noted that the administration's move appeared to contradict her previous order. Oregon and Portland, along with California, sought the injunction. The White House has appealed the decision, stating that protesters in Portland are causing mayhem. The administration had federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard earlier. Trump criticized the judge's initial ruling, stating that the judge 'ought to be ashamed of themselves.'
