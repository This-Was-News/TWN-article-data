## Article summary
Illinois and Chicago filed a lawsuit to stop President Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Chicago, alleging the move is unlawful and dangerous. The lawsuit follows a federal judge's decision to block similar deployments to Portland, Oregon. Meanwhile, Trump has been portraying Democrat-led cities as lawless and has been cracking down on illegal immigration. Officials in Chicago and Portland dispute Trump's characterizations, stating that military intervention is not needed and that federal involvement inflames the situation. The lawsuit comes after Illinois Governor JB Pritzker announced that 300 of the state's National Guard troops were to be federalized and deployed to Chicago, along with 400 others from Texas. The legal challenge is part of a broader context of protests and tensions over immigration enforcement and federal involvement in local affairs.
