## Article summary
President Donald Trump is considering reducing the U.S. refugee intake to as low as 7,500, with a focus on admitting mostly white South Africans. This dramatic decrease from previous years' figures has not been finalized or officially communicated to Congress. The move has sparked concerns from advocates, who warn it could disproportionately favor one group over others and leave thousands of vetted refugees in limbo. The refugee program, once bipartisan, has seen a significant reduction in admissions since Trump's presidency. The White House states the cap is not final until consultations with Congress are completed. Currently, due to the government shutdown, no refugees are being admitted. Advocates highlight the plight of 128,000 approved refugees and 14,000 religious minorities in Iran who are stuck in the system. The proposed cap is a stark reduction from historical levels and even lower than what advocates had anticipated. Lawmakers have criticized the administration for defying the law and leaving refugees in perilous situations while prioritizing white South African farmers.
