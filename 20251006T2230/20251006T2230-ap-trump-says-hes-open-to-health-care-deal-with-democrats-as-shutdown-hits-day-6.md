## Article summary
President Donald Trump expressed openness to negotiating with Democrats on health care subsidies, a central issue in the government shutdown. Conservatives argue that extending these subsidies, which reduce the cost of Affordable Care Act plans, wastes billions. Despite Trump's optimistic remarks, negotiations have been minimal, with Democrats urging his involvement. Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries denied ongoing negotiations, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune suggested a potential path forward on ACA subsidies. The shutdown, now in its sixth day, has disrupted federal services, with both parties blaming each other. Senate votes on government funding are expected to fail. Republicans accuse Democrats of causing a critical food aid program to run low on funds, while Democrats insist on addressing the health care crisis. House Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Democrats for the impasse, urging them to pass a stopgap spending bill. The stalemate occurs amid economic uncertainty, with slowed hiring, elevated inflation, and a growing budget deficit. The Trump administration plans to use the shutdown to impose permanent job cuts on government workers, a tactic never used before. The situation remains tense, with both parties betting on public sentiment to pressure the other side to concede.
