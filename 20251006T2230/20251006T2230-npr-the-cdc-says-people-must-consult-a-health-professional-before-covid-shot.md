## Article summary
The CDC has issued new guidelines requiring individuals to consult with a health professional before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, a process termed 'shared decision-making.' This change, implemented by Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill, aims to ensure informed consent but has faced criticism from vaccine experts who argue it could reduce vaccination rates. The guidelines also complicate access to the MMRV combination vaccine for children under 4, preferring separate shots due to a slight risk of fevers and seizures. The CDC maintains that the COVID-19 vaccines remain safe and effective, though access has become more restricted, particularly for those not at high risk. The new policies have sparked confusion and concern among healthcare providers and the public, with some states and medical groups issuing their own recommendations. Additionally, the CDC has called for the MMR vaccine to be administered as three separate shots, a move criticized by vaccine manufacturers and health experts for lacking scientific basis and potentially undermining public trust in vaccines.
