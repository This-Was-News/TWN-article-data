## Article summary
President Donald Trump is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, with uncertainty surrounding the potential sale of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Zelenskyy seeks these weapons to strike deep into Russian territory, aiming to pressure Putin into serious negotiations. Trump had previously shown openness to the idea but appeared to downplay it after a call with Putin, who warned that such a move would damage U.S.-Russia relations. Ukrainian officials argue that the discussion of Tomahawks has already pushed Putin towards talks. This meeting marks the fourth face-to-face encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy since January. Trump recently announced plans to meet Putin in Budapest to discuss ending the war, following a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. Trump has expressed increased frustration with Putin and shifted his stance on Ukraine's territorial losses, now believing Ukraine can reclaim all lost territory. Despite earlier diplomatic efforts, including a summit with Putin and a meeting with Zelenskyy, progress has stalled, with Putin showing no interest in direct talks with Zelenskyy. Trump hinted that indirect negotiations might be necessary, given the strained relationship between the two leaders.
