## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown, now in its third week, has not seen any significant progress in negotiations on Capitol Hill. The Trump administration has taken steps to mitigate some of the most immediate impacts, such as ensuring military paychecks and funding for certain programs, which has reduced the sense of urgency for Congress to act. House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that the House will not reconvene until Senate Democrats drop their opposition to a stopgap funding bill passed by the House. Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Peter Welch, argue that the shutdown is at a standstill and that the administration's actions are prolonging the impasse. Democrats are using their leverage to push for a debate on expiring health care subsidies, which they believe could force the GOP to negotiate. The shutdown's effects are starting to be felt more widely, with potential flight cancellations and delays at airports. The situation is expected to continue for weeks, with open enrollment for Affordable Care Act coverage beginning on November 1, which could further pressure Congress to act. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has offered Democrats a vote on health care subsidies but insists that the government must be reopened first. Democrats believe that President Trump's involvement could quickly resolve the shutdown, citing his history of deal-making and the reliance of his supporters on the tax credits at stake.
