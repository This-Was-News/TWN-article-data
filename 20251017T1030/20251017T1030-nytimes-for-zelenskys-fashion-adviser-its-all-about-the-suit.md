## Article summary
Viktor Anisimov, a top Ukrainian fashion designer, has been advising President Volodymyr Zelensky on his wardrobe. Anisimov first met Zelensky 20 years ago when he was a comedian and initially reluctant to wear suits. Despite Zelensky's public stance against wearing suits until the war with Russia ends, Anisimov has been gradually introducing suit-like elements into his wardrobe. Anisimov's journey into fashion began unexpectedly when he designed elaborate metal hangers for a beauty salon, which caught the attention of Ukrainian Fashion Week's founder. His designs are known for their complexity and deep philosophy. The war initially made fashion seem irrelevant to him, but he eventually returned to designing, including outfits for Ukraine's Paralympic team. Anisimov's latest collection features unisex, utilitarian black outfits. He has been strategically introducing suit-like elements into Zelensky's wardrobe, culminating in Zelensky wearing a black suit during a meeting with former President Trump and at the United Nations General Assembly. Anisimov hopes Zelensky will eventually embrace a classic suit.
