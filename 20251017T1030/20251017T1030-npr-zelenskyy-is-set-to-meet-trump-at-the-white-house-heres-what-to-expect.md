## Article summary
President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on August 18 to discuss a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Their previous meetings have been marked by a shift in tone, from a contentious encounter in February to a more cordial meeting in August. Trump has recently expressed support for Ukraine, suggesting it could win back all seized land from Russia. Analysts note that Trump's change in attitude may stem from Ukraine's military successes and Russia's struggles. Trump has criticized Putin for not ending the war and plans to meet with him in Budapest to discuss peace. Meanwhile, Ukraine's supporters in Washington advocate for increased sanctions on Russia and more military aid for Ukraine. A deal signed in April gives the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals, and further cooperation could benefit both countries in future conflicts, including with China.
