## Article summary
Col. Michael Randrianirina, an army colonel, was sworn in as Madagascar's new president following a military coup that ousted President Andry Rajoelina. The coup was condemned by the United Nations and led to Madagascar's suspension from the African Union. Randrianirina, who led the rebellion, announced the military takeover after three weeks of anti-government protests. Rajoelina fled the country, reportedly on a French military plane, and his whereabouts remain unknown. The protests, led by young people, were initially against water and power outages but expanded to include issues like the cost of living and corruption. Randrianirina plans to rule with a military council for 18 months to two years before new elections. Despite the coup, there has been little significant international reaction, and Randrianirina's troops have been celebrated by many Madagascans. The colonel has promised to restore the country's glory and address social problems. Madagascar has a history of political instability and high poverty rates, with around 75% of the population affected.
