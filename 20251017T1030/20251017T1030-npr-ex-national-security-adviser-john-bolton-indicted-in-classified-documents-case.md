## Article summary
John Bolton, former national security adviser under President Trump, has been indicted on 18 charges related to the mishandling of classified documents. The charges include eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of unlawful retention. The Justice Department alleges Bolton illegally transmitted classified information via personal email and messaging apps. The FBI executed a search warrant at Bolton's home two months prior, recovering classified documents. Bolton's lawyer claims the charges stem from personal diaries and not classified information. Bolton has been a vocal critic of Trump since leaving office. The indictment follows recent charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Bolton's memoir, critical of Trump, was published in 2020, leading to a lawsuit by the Trump administration that was later dismissed.
