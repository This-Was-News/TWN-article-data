## Article summary
John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has been charged with storing and sharing classified information. The 18-count indictment alleges that Bolton kept top-secret records at home and shared diary-like notes containing classified information with relatives. The indictment also suggests that classified information was exposed when hackers linked to the Iranian regime accessed Bolton's email account. Bolton's legal team argues that the information shared was unclassified and known to the FBI since 2021. The case is seen as part of a broader pattern of the Justice Department targeting Trump's political enemies. Bolton has denied the charges, calling them an effort to intimidate his opponents. The indictment is more detailed than previous cases against Trump adversaries and was signed by career national security prosecutors. Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, stated that the charges stem from personal diaries and that Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information. Bolton's tenure as national security adviser was marked by disputes with Trump, leading to his firing in 2019. Bolton later published a critical book about Trump, which the Trump administration attempted to block, alleging it contained classified information.
