## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is set to meet President Trump at the White House to discuss arms deals and peace prospects, following a call between Trump and Putin. Zelensky aims to secure more American support, including Tomahawk missiles, to strike deep within Russia. Trump, however, has been cautious, emphasizing the risks and potential escalation. Zelensky's strategy involves fewer talks and more weapons to force Russia into negotiations. The meeting is their third in the Oval Office this year, highlighting Zelensky's persistent efforts to gain Trump's backing. Meanwhile, former Trump aide John Bolton was indicted for mishandling classified information, sending diary notes to family members without clearances. The indictment compares Bolton's case to Trump's own classified documents case, noting similarities in handling sensitive information. Both cases involve past statements criticizing others for similar actions. Bolton's indictment includes charges of unauthorized transmission and retention of classified information, with potential prison time. The investigation into Bolton gained momentum during the Biden administration, contrasting with Trump's recent actions against perceived enemies.
