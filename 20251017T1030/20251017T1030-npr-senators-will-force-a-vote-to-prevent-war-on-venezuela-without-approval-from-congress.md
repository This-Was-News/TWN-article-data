## Article summary
Senator Tim Kaine is leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote to prevent President Trump from unilaterally declaring war on Venezuela. Kaine filed a resolution that will require the Senate to consider the legislation after a 10-day waiting period, with Sens. Adam Schiff and Rand Paul co-sponsoring the plan. Concerns about imminent military action in the region are growing due to recent U.S. military strikes and covert operations in Venezuela. Trump has authorized CIA operations and is considering land operations in Venezuela, citing alleged drug smuggling. Kaine and Schiff previously forced a Senate vote to limit Trump's war powers in the Caribbean, which failed but gained support from two Republicans. Paul has criticized the military strikes, emphasizing the need for public debate and congressional approval before war. The senators hope to gain more Republican support for the new limits on Trump's war powers. However, it is unclear if there will be enough votes for the measure to succeed. Kaine highlights a lack of information from the administration regarding actions against Venezuela, with lawmakers questioning the legality and constitutionality of the boat strikes. Trump has ordered multiple military strikes on alleged drug boats, resulting in reported deaths, but identities of those killed have not been disclosed.
