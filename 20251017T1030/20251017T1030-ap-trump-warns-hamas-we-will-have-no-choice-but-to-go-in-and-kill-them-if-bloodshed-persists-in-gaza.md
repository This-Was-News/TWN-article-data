## Article summary
President Donald Trump warned Hamas that the U.S. would have to intervene and 'kill them' if internal violence in Gaza continued. He later clarified that U.S. troops wouldn't be involved, implying nearby forces would act under U.S. auspices. Trump's tone shifted from previous statements where he downplayed Hamas's actions. The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, brokered by Trump, is facing challenges as Hamas has not fully complied with hostage return terms. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded Hamas fulfill the ceasefire requirements. Hamas claimed to have honored the ceasefire terms by handing over hostage remains. The U.S. sent troops to Israel to support the ceasefire but clarified they wouldn't enter Gaza. Israeli officials are frustrated with the slow return of dead hostages. Hamas has assured the U.S. through intermediaries that it is working to return the remains of deceased hostages. The situation remains tense as the ceasefire's future hangs in the balance.
