## Article summary
Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's president, faces a delicate political balancing act as she prepares to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The recent sentencing of Mexican drug kingpin Ismael Zambada García in a New York courtroom highlighted the issue of corruption in Mexico, with Zambada admitting to bribing officials. This has put Sheinbaum under pressure from the White House to tackle corruption. Sheinbaum has been navigating a complex relationship with both the U.S. and her powerful political party at home. She has expressed a willingness to work with President Trump but has also asserted her independence. Rubio has emphasized the challenges posed by criminal groups' influence and corruption in Mexico. The situation underscores the tightrope Sheinbaum must walk between international pressure and domestic political dynamics.
