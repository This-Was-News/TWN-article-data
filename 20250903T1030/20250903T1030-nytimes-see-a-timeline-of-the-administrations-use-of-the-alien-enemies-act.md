## Article summary
A legal battle is unfolding in federal courts over President Trump's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership. Recently, a federal appeals court blocked Trump from using this law, rejecting the administration's claim that the migrants were part of an invasion by a foreign power. The 2-1 ruling by the Fifth Circuit, a conservative appeals court, specified that the injunction only applied to the use of the Alien Enemies Act and did not prevent the government from using other legal means to remove foreign terrorists. The case is likely to proceed to the Supreme Court, which will fully examine whether Trump's use of the act is lawful. The Supreme Court has already issued orders limiting the government's use of this law. The situation raises questions about whether judicial orders are being followed, as Trump has stated he respects the Supreme Court.
