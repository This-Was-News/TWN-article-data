## Article summary
California's high-speed rail project faces an uncertain future as federal funding is threatened by the Trump administration. Despite setbacks, construction continues on a 119-mile stretch around Fresno and Bakersfield, with track laying potentially starting next year. CEO Ian Choudhary acknowledges past mistakes but insists the project is on track. The Hanford Viaduct, an elevated structure over 6,300 feet long, is a key part of the ongoing construction. Critics, including U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, argue the project is a boondoggle and seek to revoke $4 billion in federal grants. The project is years behind schedule and billions over budget, with an updated price tag of $135 billion. The California High-Speed Rail Authority disputes claims of no viable path forward and has outlined a new strategy to connect the Central Valley to the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles by 2038. Despite challenges, the project is already having a positive impact in places like Fresno, where infrastructure improvements are reconnecting neighborhoods. However, some Californians and experts remain skeptical about the project's future and its ability to deliver on its original promises.
