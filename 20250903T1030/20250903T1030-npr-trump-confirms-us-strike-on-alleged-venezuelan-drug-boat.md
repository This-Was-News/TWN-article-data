## Article summary
Tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela have escalated, with President Trump confirming a U.S. Navy strike on a suspected Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean. The strike, described as a 'lethal strike' by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targeted a vessel allegedly operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization. Trump claimed 11 people were killed, identifying them as terrorists linked to Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang. This action follows a broader U.S. naval presence in the Caribbean, part of a confrontational stance against the Venezuelan regime. The U.S. accuses Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of leading a drug cartel and has offered a $50 million bounty for his capture. Recently, the U.S. deployed warships, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group, to Venezuelan waters as a show of force. Maduro has responded by declaring 'maximum preparedness,' mobilizing 4.5 million militia members. The Venezuelan government has not yet responded to the U.S. strike or Trump's claims. Former U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela James Story criticized the current administration's policy toward Venezuela as incoherent, noting previous U.S. naval deployments had little impact. In July, the U.S. allowed Chevron to resume operations in Venezuela.
