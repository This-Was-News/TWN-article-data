## Article summary
A federal appeals court panel ruled that President Donald Trump cannot use the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to deport members of a Venezuelan gang, blocking a key administration initiative. The three-judge panel, including conservative judges, agreed with immigrant rights lawyers that the act was not intended for such use. The ACLU argued that the administration's use of the wartime statute during peacetime was rightly shut down. The administration had deported gang members to El Salvador, where over 250 later returned to Venezuela. The Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before, all during declared wars. The court found no justification for using the act in this case, with the majority opinion stating that the situation did not meet historical levels of national conflict. Judge Andrew Oldham, a Trump appointee, dissented, arguing that the majority was improperly second-guessing the president's foreign affairs conduct. The court did uphold the administration's procedures for advising detainees of their legal rights. The ruling can be appealed to the full 5th Circuit or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which may ultimately decide the issue.
