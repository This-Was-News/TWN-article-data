## Article summary
Construction has intensified at a site linked to Israel's suspected nuclear program, according to satellite images analyzed by experts. The work is taking place at the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center near Dimona, which is key to Israel's widely believed nuclear weapons program. Experts suggest the new structure could be a reactor or a facility to assemble nuclear arms, but secrecy makes it difficult to confirm. The construction renews questions about Israel's status as the Middle East's only nuclear-armed state and could draw international criticism, especially after Israel and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites in Iran. Seven experts analyzed the images, with three suggesting it could be a new heavy water reactor, which can produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The other four experts acknowledged it could be a reactor but also suggested it might be a facility for assembling nuclear weapons. Israel does not confirm or deny having nuclear weapons, and neither Israel nor the U.S. responded to requests for comment. The Associated Press first reported on excavations at the facility in 2021, and recent images show intensified construction with thick concrete retaining walls and multiple floors underground. The current reactor at Dimona has been operating far longer than most reactors of its era, suggesting it may need replacement or retrofitting soon. The secrecy surrounding Israel's nuclear program makes it difficult to estimate the number of nuclear weapons it possesses, with estimates around 90 warheads.
