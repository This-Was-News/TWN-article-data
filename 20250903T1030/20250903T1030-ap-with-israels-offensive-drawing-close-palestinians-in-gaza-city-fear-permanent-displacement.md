## Article summary
Palestinians in Gaza City face an impossible choice as Israel's offensive approaches: leave and risk never returning, or stay and face potential death. With Gaza City declared a combat zone, residents are paralyzed by fear, unsure of when to flee and where to go. Many who returned after initial evacuations now fear permanent displacement as Israel bulldozes neighborhoods and leaders support mass relocation. Satellite images show extensive destruction in areas like Zetoun and Sabra. Medical workers and elderly individuals find leaving nearly impossible, while others, like Amal Seyam, refuse to abandon those in need. Displaced Palestinians in the south face dire conditions, with overcrowded tent camps and scarce resources. The arrival of more displaced people exacerbates the struggle for basic necessities like water and food. The situation highlights the devastating impact of the conflict on civilians, leaving them with no viable options for safety or stability.
