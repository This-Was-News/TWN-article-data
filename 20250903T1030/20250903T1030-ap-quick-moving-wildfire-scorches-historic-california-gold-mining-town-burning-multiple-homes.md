## Article summary
A fast-moving wildfire in Tuolumne County, California, burned thousands of acres and multiple homes in the historic Chinese Camp Town, settled by Chinese miners around 1850. The fire grew rapidly to 6.25 square miles, forcing evacuations and remaining uncontained. At least five homes were burning, with residents desperately trying to protect their properties until firefighters arrived. The blaze, named the 6-5 Fire, was caused by lightning and is one of many fires across California. Chinese Camp Town, originally called Camp Washington, was settled by Chinese miners who were driven out of a nearby camp. During the Gold Rush, thousands of Chinese faced persecution, including an exorbitant Foreign Miners Tax aimed at driving them away from mining.
