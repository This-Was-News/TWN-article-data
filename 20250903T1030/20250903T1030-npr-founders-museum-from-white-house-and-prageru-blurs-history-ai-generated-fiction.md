## Article summary
The 'Founders Museum,' a collaboration between the Trump administration and conservative nonprofit PragerU, features 82 paintings and 40 AI-generated videos of historical figures from America's founding. The exhibit, located near the White House, aims to engage Americans with history ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. However, historians have raised concerns about the exhibit's narrow focus and the blurring of lines between reality and fiction in AI-generated videos. Some videos attribute phrases to historical figures that they did not actually say, and others oversimplify complex figures like Mercy Otis Warren. PragerU, known for its conservative content, defends the videos, stating they are grounded in historical sources. The exhibit plans to tour the country, promoting a perspective of American greatness while acknowledging its flaws. Critics argue that the exhibit omits marginalized voices and presents a sanitized version of history.
