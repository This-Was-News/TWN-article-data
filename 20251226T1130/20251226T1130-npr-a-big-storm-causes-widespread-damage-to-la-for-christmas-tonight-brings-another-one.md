## Article summary
Southern California is experiencing record-breaking rainfall, with downtown L.A. receiving 9.55 inches since October 1st, making it potentially the seventh wettest season on record. Forecasters warn that more heavy rain is expected through Friday, with the potential for an additional 1 to 3 inches, and up to 4 inches in the mountains, leading to further flooding concerns. The storm system has already caused widespread street flooding, road closures, and evacuations in burn scar areas due to the increased risk of debris flows and landslides. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency for several counties, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has issued a local emergency declaration to mobilize city resources. Authorities are urging residents to minimize travel, avoid driving through standing water, and pay attention to severe weather warnings, as conditions can be life-threatening. Several communities, like the mountain town of Wrightwood, have been particularly hard-hit, with evacuation orders and shelter-in-place mandates remaining in effect. Power outages and nearly 500 tree emergencies have also been reported across the city. This storm is considered a rare event, occurring only once every five to ten years, and its impact is amplified by its occurrence during the holiday season. Residents are advised to stay informed about weather warnings, understand evacuation orders, and take precautions for driving and staying safe during high winds and power outages.
