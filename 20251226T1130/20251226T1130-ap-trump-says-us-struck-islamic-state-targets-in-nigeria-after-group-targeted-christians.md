## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced on Christmas evening that the U.S. conducted a significant airstrike against Islamic State forces in Nigeria. This action followed weeks of Trump criticizing the Nigerian government for its perceived failure to protect Christians from persecution. The Defense Department confirmed the U.S. collaborated with Nigeria on the strikes, which were approved by the Nigerian government. Nigeria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated the cooperation involved intelligence sharing and strategic coordination, respecting sovereignty and international law. Trump asserted the strikes targeted militants who were primarily targeting and killing innocent Christians. However, residents and analysts note that the security crisis in Nigeria affects both Christians and Muslims. Nigeria is contending with various armed groups, including factions affiliated with the Islamic State. Security experts suggest the target might have been the Lakurawa group, known for its increasing lethality in northwestern Nigeria. This intervention comes as the U.S. has previously imposed visa restrictions and designated Nigeria as a country of particular concern regarding religious freedom. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated that more actions are to come, expressing gratitude for Nigerian government cooperation.
