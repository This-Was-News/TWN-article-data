## Article summary
An arms race for nuclear-powered submarines is escalating between North and South Korea, influenced by changes in U.S. security strategy in the region. North Korea recently revealed its first nuclear-powered strategic guided missile submarine, with leader Kim Jong Un stating it's necessary for defense against a negative security situation. South Korea, with U.S. approval, is rapidly developing its own nuclear submarines, aiming to counter North Korea's growing maritime nuclear capabilities. The U.S. anticipates these South Korean submarines will also play a role in countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. South Korea's defense minister highlighted the limitations of conventional submarines against nuclear-powered ones. While South Korea officially denies nuclear ambitions, some experts suggest that the pursuit of nuclear submarines is a step towards nuclear armament, driven by growing distrust in U.S. security commitments and concerns about China's expanding naval power. A majority of South Koreans reportedly support nuclear armament, even if it means facing international sanctions or the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The U.S. administration's actions, according to one analyst, are inadvertently pushing South Korea and Japan towards nuclear armament.
