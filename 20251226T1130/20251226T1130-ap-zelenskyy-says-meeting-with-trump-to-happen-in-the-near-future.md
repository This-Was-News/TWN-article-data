## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled for the near future, signaling potential progress in ending the Russia-Ukraine war. Zelenskyy expressed optimism, stating that much could be decided before the New Year. This announcement follows recent conversations with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Trump has initiated diplomatic efforts, though faced with conflicting demands from both Moscow and Kyiv. Zelenskyy previously indicated willingness to create a demilitarized zone in eastern Ukraine, contingent on Russian withdrawal and international monitoring. While Russia has suggested slow progress in peace talks, they have not indicated any plans to withdraw from seized territories. Moscow insists on Ukraine relinquishing remaining Donbas territory, an ultimatum Kyiv has rejected. On the ground, recent Russian attacks have caused casualties and power outages in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine reported striking a major Russian oil refinery using British-supplied missiles, aiming to disrupt Moscow's revenue for the invasion. Russia, in turn, has targeted Ukraine's power grid, attempting to weaponize winter conditions.
