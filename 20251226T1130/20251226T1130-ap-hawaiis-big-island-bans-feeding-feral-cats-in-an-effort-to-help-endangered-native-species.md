## Article summary
Hawaii's Big Island has enacted a new law banning the feeding of feral cats on county property, effective at the start of the new year. This measure aims to protect endangered native species, such as the nene goose, which are threatened by feral cats, considered super predators. The ban, however, has faced opposition from cat lovers who argue it will lead to starvation and increased hunting by hungry cats. Biologists point out that feral cats not only prey on native wildlife but also spread diseases like toxoplasmosis through their feces, which can harm endangered Hawaiian monk seals and native birds. Despite concerns from some residents and the mayor, who hopes for lenient enforcement, the county council passed the ban with a significant majority. Opponents believe the ban will not solve the problem and may simply drive feeding efforts underground, while some cultural practitioners argue for the removal of the cats altogether due to their impact on the vulnerable ecosystem. The debate highlights a conflict between the welfare of domestic animals and the conservation of native Hawaiian species.
