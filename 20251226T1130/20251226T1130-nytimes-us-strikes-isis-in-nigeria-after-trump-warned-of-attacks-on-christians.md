## Article summary
President Trump announced that the United States conducted strikes against ISIS in northwestern Nigeria, targeting jihadis accused of slaughtering Christians. The operation involved Tomahawk missiles fired from a Navy ship in the Gulf of Guinea, hitting two ISIS camps in Sokoto State in coordination with the Nigerian military. U.S. Africa Command confirmed the strikes killed multiple ISIS terrorists and aims to protect Americans and disrupt violent extremist organizations. The attack occurred in a region bordering Niger, where the Islamic State-Sahel has been active. This U.S. operation followed months of allegations by Christian groups and Republicans about the targeting of Christians in Nigeria. While Nigerian authorities acknowledge widespread violence, they reject claims of Christian genocide, stating that both Muslims and Christians are killed. Nigerian officials have increased engagement with the U.S. following President Trump's earlier order to prepare for military intervention. The strikes mark the second recent U.S. military action against an ISIS branch, following strikes in Syria the previous week. Despite the operation, American military officials expressed doubt about its long-term impact due to the entrenched nature of the conflict, which involves armed bandits and jihadist groups like Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province.
