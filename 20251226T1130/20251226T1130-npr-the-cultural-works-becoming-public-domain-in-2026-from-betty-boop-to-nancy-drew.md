## Article summary
In 2026, a vast collection of cultural works from 1930 will enter the public domain, becoming free to use, share, and adapt. This includes iconic characters like the original Betty Boop and Disney's Pluto, literary works such as William Faulkner's "As I Lay Dying" and Agatha Christie's first Miss Marple mystery, and films by directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hughes. Notably, these films predate the restrictive Hays Code. Musical compositions like "Georgia on My Mind" and artworks including Piet Mondrian's "Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow" will also be freely available. The public domain status allows for new creative adaptations, such as musicals or films, without needing permission or paying royalties. This also increases the availability and affordability of these works, aiding in their preservation and wider distribution, especially benefiting educators. Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, highlights the value of these works in nurturing creativity and access. She emphasizes the humanity behind these creations, made in the shadow of World War I, and notes that human authorship remains a requirement for copyright, even in the age of AI.
