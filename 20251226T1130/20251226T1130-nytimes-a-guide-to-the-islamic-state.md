## Article summary
The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has transformed into a global franchise, extending its influence beyond the Middle East through regional affiliates and inspired attackers. Although it no longer controls significant territory, the group continues to carry out attacks and insurgent campaigns across Asia and Africa. Originating from Al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS exploited instability in Syria to seize territory and declare a caliphate in 2014, gaining notoriety for extreme violence. Despite the killing of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and the loss of its territorial caliphate, ISIS remains active. Recent attacks, including bombings in Iran and a concert hall near Moscow, have been attributed to its affiliates, particularly ISIS-K in Afghanistan. Counterterrorism officials categorize ISIS attacks as directed, enabled, or inspired, with inspired attacks involving self-radicalized individuals acting independently. The group's presence in Syria and Iraq is a concern, with ongoing U.S. military operations targeting its fighters and camps. ISIS is also expanding its reach in unstable regions like the African Sahel, with affiliate groups in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mozambique being significant sources of propaganda. The group's radical ideology continues to propagate, posing a persistent global security threat.
