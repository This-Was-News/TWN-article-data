## Article summary
The public release of grand jury transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case has intensified scrutiny on her, despite her claims of innocence and a recent request for immediate release from prison. These transcripts, part of the Justice Department's ongoing release of Epstein's investigative files, detail Maxwell's significant role in Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long abuse of young girls and women. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 after four women testified about their abuse by her and Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial. Maxwell's habeas petition, filed without a lawyer, argues that new evidence proves constitutional violations tainted her trial, claiming withheld exonerating information and witness perjury. A judge recently admonished Maxwell for not redacting victim identities from her court papers, emphasizing the need to protect victims. Victims fear Maxwell may receive a pardon, with one accuser stating the released records highlight Maxwell's criminal involvement. The transcripts were released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but the Justice Department cited delays in redacting victim information and the discovery of over a million new documents for further delays in releasing the full trove. An FBI agent's testimony within the transcripts describes how Maxwell and Epstein groomed a 14-year-old girl, with Maxwell normalizing the abusive situation and normalizing Epstein's sexual advances.
