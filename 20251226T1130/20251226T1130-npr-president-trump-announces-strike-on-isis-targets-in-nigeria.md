## Article summary
President Trump announced a "deadly strike" against ISIS fighters in northwest Nigeria on Christmas night, stating the U.S. acted against terrorists who have been "viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians." He warned that "there would be hell to pay" if the slaughter continued and declared that under his leadership, the U.S. would not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper. This action follows recent U.S. strikes in Syria and Trump's previous threats to take military action against Nigeria and suspend aid due to its alleged failure to stop Christian persecution. U.S. Africa Command confirmed a strike in Sokoto State, Nigeria, in cooperation with Nigerian authorities, killing multiple ISIS terrorists. Nigeria's Foreign Minister confirmed intelligence sharing and presidential approval for the strike, describing it as an "ongoing process" with international partners. However, critics suggest Trump's social media announcement before the Nigerian government's statement could undermine the message that the fight is not religiously motivated. This also raises questions about a potential new, long-term U.S. military role and Nigeria's ability to influence or control U.S. operations in the region.
