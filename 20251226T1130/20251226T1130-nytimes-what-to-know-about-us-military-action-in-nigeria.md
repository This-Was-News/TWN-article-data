## Article summary
The United States conducted missile strikes on Islamic State targets in northwestern Nigeria following President Trump's threat to take military action if the Nigerian government did not stop the killing of Christians by Islamist militants. The strikes, launched from a Navy ship, hit two Islamic State camps in Sokoto State, killing multiple terrorists. President Trump accused the group of targeting and killing Christians, while the Defense Department stated the strikes were carried out in coordination with the Nigerian government. Nigeria has denied accusations of religious intolerance, with its Foreign Ministry calling terrorist attacks an affront to national values. President Tinubu emphasized the government's efforts to safeguard religious freedom for all Nigerians. Nigeria faces significant terrorism challenges, including from Boko Haram and its splinter group, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), which has pledged allegiance to ISIS. While Boko Haram primarily targets civilians, ISWAP and its affiliate ISIS-Sahel have increasingly targeted military troops. The resurgence of ISIS affiliates in Africa is partly attributed to recent coups and the withdrawal of Western forces, creating a security vacuum. The U.S. has also withdrawn military personnel from Niger, ending a key counterterrorism partnership in the region. Despite territorial losses in the Middle East, ISIS affiliates remain active in various parts of Africa and Asia.
