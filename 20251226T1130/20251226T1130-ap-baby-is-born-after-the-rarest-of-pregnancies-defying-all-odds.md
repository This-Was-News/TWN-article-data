## Article summary
A baby boy named Ryu was born after an exceptionally rare pregnancy, developing outside his mother's uterus and hidden by a large ovarian cyst. Suze Lopez, 41, was unaware she was pregnant until days before giving birth, initially mistaking her growing belly for her cyst. This type of abdominal pregnancy is extremely rare, with full-term cases being almost unheard of, making Ryu's survival a medical marvel. Doctors at Cedars-Sinai hospital plan to document the case due to its rarity and the successful outcome. Lopez experienced no typical pregnancy symptoms, and her irregular periods contributed to the delayed discovery. A CT scan, required for a planned cyst removal, revealed the unexpected pregnancy. Her husband, Andrew, was surprised and emotional upon learning the news. Upon seeking medical help for severe pain and high blood pressure, scans confirmed a nearly full-term fetus in an amniotic sac within her abdomen, not her uterus. The medical team successfully delivered Ryu and removed the cyst during surgery, managing significant blood loss. Both mother and baby recovered well, and Ryu is now healthy and thriving. Lopez considers her son a miracle and the best gift ever.
