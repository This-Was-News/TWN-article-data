## Article summary
President Donald Trump frequently claims to have resolved eight global conflicts, often seeking the Nobel Peace Prize. However, many of these deals are precarious, with some already unraveling. While Trump touts these agreements as major peace achievements, experts suggest they are often overhyped ceasefires rather than lasting peace accords. For instance, a deal between Thailand and Cambodia flared up into renewed fighting shortly after being announced. Similarly, a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo saw continued conflict even as it was being formally signed. Critics argue that genuine, long-term conflict resolution requires painstaking diplomacy and time, which these quick deals lack. Despite these criticisms, Trump's unconventional approach has sometimes yielded results, such as normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab nations. However, other efforts, like those involving India and Pakistan, have led to diplomatic friction. Conflicts like Ukraine and Russia remain beyond his grasp, and his confrontational stance with Venezuela contrasts with his peacemaker image. While Trump received the FIFA Peace Prize for his efforts, the long-term impact of his brokered deals remains uncertain.
