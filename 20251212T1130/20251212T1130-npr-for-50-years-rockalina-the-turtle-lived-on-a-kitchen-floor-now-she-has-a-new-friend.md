## Article summary
Rockalina, an eastern box turtle, has begun a new chapter in her recovery after enduring nearly 50 years of neglect in an unnatural kitchen floor environment. Rescued in February, she was found in critical condition, with skin and eye issues, and her legs entangled. For half a century, she had been kept as a pet, subsisting on cat food. Now under the care of Garden State Tortoise, Rockalina has shown remarkable resilience, regaining her health and engaging in natural behaviors like digging and eating strawberries. Her recovery has progressed to the point where she has met a baby turtle, her own kind, for the first time. This interaction, described as a beautiful moment, involved curiosity and shared food, marking a significant milestone. The sanctuary hopes to establish a colony for Rockalina, allowing her to socialize with other turtles. Her journey has garnered significant public attention, with over a million followers on Facebook, helping to educate people about the importance of appreciating and leaving wild turtles in their natural habitats. Rockalina's story serves as a crucial step in promoting conservation and understanding for her species.
