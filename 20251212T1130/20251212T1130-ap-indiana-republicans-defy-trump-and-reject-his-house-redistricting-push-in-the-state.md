## Article summary
Indiana's Republican-led Senate has rejected a proposed congressional map that would have benefited their party, defying pressure from former President Donald Trump. The vote, which saw more Republicans opposing than supporting the measure, signals the limits of Trump's influence even in conservative states. Trump had been urging Republicans nationwide to redraw maps to help the party maintain its House majority, with states like Texas, Missouri, Ohio, and North Carolina complying. However, Indiana's decision came despite cajoling and threats from the president, including the possibility of primary challenges for those who voted no. The proposed map was designed to give Republicans control of all nine of Indiana's congressional seats, effectively eliminating the two Democrat-held districts. Despite Trump's efforts, including calls and involvement from White House aides, the measure failed decisively. Some Republican senators cited the federal government should not dictate state matters and expressed concern over constituents' objections to the proposed district changes. The debate was shadowed by the possibility of violence, with some lawmakers reporting threats. Former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels praised the senators for their principled leadership in rejecting the map, calling the outcome a significant setback for Trump and associated groups. Democratic lawmakers also spoke out against the redistricting, emphasizing the importance of competition and winning based on merit.
