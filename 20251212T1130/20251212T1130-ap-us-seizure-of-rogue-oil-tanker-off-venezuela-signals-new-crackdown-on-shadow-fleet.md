## Article summary
The U.S. has seized the oil tanker Skipper off the coast of Venezuela, marking a significant escalation in its efforts to pressure Nicolás Maduro's regime by cutting off oil revenues. This action signals a potential crackdown on a "shadow fleet" of aging tankers used by sanctioned countries like Venezuela, Russia, and Iran to smuggle oil. These vessels often obscure their locations using falsified identification systems and transfer cargoes at sea, making them difficult to track. The Skipper, previously sanctioned for alleged links to illicit oil smuggling for Iran and Hezbollah, was found to be digitally manipulating its tracking signals to appear off the coast of Guyana while carrying crude oil. Experts believe this seizure could deter other "risk-tolerant operators" in the industry, as the physical confiscation of a vessel represents a new level of risk compared to financial penalties. While Venezuela's oil production has increased recently through such smuggling tactics, this seizure might lead to a decrease in illicit Venezuelan crude prices due to fewer willing buyers. The seizure has been lauded by Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado as a way to redirect resources away from repression, while Maduro has condemned it as "international piracy" and the "kidnapping" of the crew.
