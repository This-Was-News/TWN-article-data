## Article summary
Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from detention on Thursday, with a court ruling stating he was held without legal basis. He was ordered to check in with immigration officials 14 hours later. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen with a U.S. wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years and previously received protection from deportation due to danger in his home country. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador despite having no criminal record. He was brought back to the U.S. by the Trump administration under human smuggling charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Abrego Garcia is suing the administration, alleging the removal process is being used to punish him for the embarrassment caused by his mistaken deportation. The judge who ordered his release criticized federal authorities for misleading the court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been seeking to deport him to African countries, but Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security has vowed to appeal the judge's order, calling it "naked judicial activism." His lawyer expects further deportation efforts and is prepared to defend his client.
