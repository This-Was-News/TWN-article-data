## Article summary
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem staunchly defended the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies during a contentious House committee hearing, framing migrants as a significant national threat. Republicans on the panel supported her stance, while Democrats fiercely questioned her, with some calling for her resignation over the mass deportation agenda. Protesters also interrupted the hearing, demanding an end to Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and deportations. Noem asserted that the unknown identities and intentions of individuals within the country pose a substantial risk. This hearing marked Noem's first congressional appearance in months, focusing heavily on immigration policies, a departure from previous years' emphasis on cybersecurity and terrorism. Ranking Democrat Rep. Bennie Thompson criticized Noem for diverting resources to the immigration agenda and failing to provide adequate responses, urging her to resign. The Trump administration has escalated immigration enforcement since his return to power, leading to increased detentions and deportations. Democrats accused Noem of lying about focusing solely on violent criminals, presenting cases of U.S. citizens being detained and families of military veterans being separated by deportations. Republicans, conversely, commended Noem's efforts to enhance national security. Noem, whose family was present, praised the administration's work in ending illegal immigration and restoring 'sanity' to the system. The hearing also touched upon the FBI's assessment of threats, with their representative highlighting 'antifa' as an immediate violent threat but not mentioning immigration. Noem linked a U.S. seizure of an oil tanker to the administration's anti-drug campaign. She also strongly criticized Operation Allies Welcome, the program used to admit individuals after the Afghanistan withdrawal, calling an incident involving a suspect a 'terrorist attack' rather than an 'unfortunate accident,' despite the Trump administration having approved the suspect's asylum claim. Noem's department has received significant funding for increased deportation officers, border wall construction, and enhanced detention and removal of foreigners.
