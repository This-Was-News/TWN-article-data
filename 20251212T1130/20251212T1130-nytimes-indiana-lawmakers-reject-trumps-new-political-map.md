## Article summary
Republican members of the Indiana Senate defied President Trump by voting down a new congressional map designed to give Republicans an advantage in U.S. House seats. This vote represented a public defeat for Trump, who had actively lobbied and threatened consequences for those who opposed his redistricting efforts. Despite Trump's downplaying of the Indiana result, calling it a minor setback, the rejection highlighted divisions within the Republican party. The proposed map, which was outside the usual redistricting cycle, aimed to flip the state's two Democratic-held congressional seats. Opponents, including some Republicans, argued the map was unconstitutional and would erode public trust in elections, with some reporting threats and harassment. Supporters, however, contended it was necessary to counter Democratic gerrymandering and secure a Republican majority in Congress. The debate exposed ideological and stylistic rifts within the Indiana Republican party, pitting long-serving members against Trump-aligned conservatives. The redistricting "arms race" initiated by Texas Republicans showed signs of cooling, with other states also experiencing resistance to new maps. Democrats criticized the plan as cynical and unfair, particularly its proposed division of Indianapolis, raising concerns about potential racial gerrymandering. Governor Mike Braun expressed disappointment, vowing to work with President Trump to challenge the senators who voted against the map, suggesting political consequences would follow.
