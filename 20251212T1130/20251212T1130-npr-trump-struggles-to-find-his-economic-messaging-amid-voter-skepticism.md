## Article summary
President Trump is facing challenges in communicating his economic message to the American public, as recent polls indicate widespread voter skepticism about the economy's performance. Despite Trump's assertions of a booming economy and promises of better times ahead, many Americans are not feeling optimistic, particularly regarding the rising cost of living. In an effort to bridge this messaging gap, the White House introduced a $12 billion farmer aid package and Trump traveled to Pennsylvania to advocate for his economic agenda. Historically, Trump has been a strong economic messenger, but he is now struggling to convince voters that their concerns about affordability are not valid. He has previously referred to the affordability issue as a Democratic "hoax." This disconnect may stem from his difficulty in acknowledging that the economy is not perfect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that media coverage might be influencing public perception. While some economic indicators, such as falling gas prices and wages outpacing inflation, are positive, other factors like elevated inflation due to tariffs are causing pain for voters. Trump himself has given his economy an "A+++++" rating and the administration has been reluctant to admit that its trade policies have negatively impacted Americans. Officials often blame the "embedded inflation from the Biden years" for current economic woes. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the reality of high costs, attributing them to inflation from previous years, but not solely to Biden. Experts suggest that Trump could address affordability by mitigating Obamacare premiums or removing tariffs, but the White House maintains its current policies and expects voters to eventually come around, citing tax cuts, deregulation, and other deals as beneficial.
