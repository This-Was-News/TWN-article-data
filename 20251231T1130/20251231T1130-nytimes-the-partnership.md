## Article summary
The Secret History of the War in Ukraine details the covert partnership between American and Ukrainian officials, initiated in Spring 2022, to support Ukraine's defense against Russia. This collaboration, centered at Clay Kaserne in Wiesbaden, Germany, involved intelligence sharing, strategic planning, and the provision of advanced weaponry. American and Ukrainian officers worked side-by-side, planning counteroffensives and identifying targets, a process that became a crucial, albeit secret, weapon for Ukraine. The partnership evolved through various stages, from initial mistrust and tactical triumphs to strategic disagreements and political complexities within Ukraine that impacted military operations. Despite challenges, the collaboration enabled Ukraine to survive and inflict significant casualties on Russian forces. The document highlights key moments, such as the sinking of the Moskva, the development of HIMARS, and the debated counteroffensives of 2023. It also explores the shifting 'red lines' of American involvement, including strikes inside Russia, and the internal Ukrainian leadership struggles that affected military strategy. The narrative underscores the deep, complex, and at times fraught relationship that defined the secret history of the war, ultimately shaping its precarious trajectory.
