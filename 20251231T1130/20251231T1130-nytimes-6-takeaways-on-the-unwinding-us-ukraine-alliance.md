## Article summary
Donald Trump's campaign pledge to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours proved to be an overestimation of his influence, as the process was far more complicated than anticipated. During the transition period, Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz, sought a secret letter from President Biden to authorize talks with Russia, but Biden refused, fearing a deal at Ukraine's expense. Trump's team, however, opened a back channel to Russia through Steve Witkoff, who was introduced to a Russian wealth fund head. Keith Kellogg, appointed as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, was sidelined as Witkoff took a more central role. The Pentagon, influenced by officials who believed in redirecting support to China, repeatedly withheld crucial munitions from Ukraine, impacting their defense capabilities. Trump overestimated his ability to sway Vladimir Putin, who largely ignored Trump's peace proposals and continued bombing Ukrainian cities. Meanwhile, the CIA and U.S. military secretly aided Ukraine in striking Russian oil refineries and shadow fleet vessels, significantly impacting the Russian economy. Despite a rocky relationship, Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bonded over discussions about Ukrainian women, humanizing Zelensky to Trump and potentially easing tensions.
