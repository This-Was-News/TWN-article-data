## Article summary
According to AP sources, the CIA was responsible for a drone strike on a Venezuelan dock believed to be used by drug cartels. This operation represents a significant escalation in the U.S. administration's pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government. President Donald Trump had previously alluded to the strike, stating that the U.S. had targeted a facility where ships are loaded with drugs. While Trump did not confirm whether the military or the CIA conducted the operation, sources close to the matter have indicated the CIA's involvement. This is the first known direct U.S. operation on Venezuelan soil since September. The strike follows a series of U.S. military actions against alleged drug boats and a quasi-blockade aimed at seizing sanctioned oil tankers. Trump has previously authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions inside Venezuela, citing the influx of drugs and prisoners from the country. The Venezuelan president has not publicly addressed the CIA operation. The U.S. Justice Department has a standing reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest on narcoterrorism charges.
