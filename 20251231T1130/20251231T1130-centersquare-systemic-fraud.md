## Article summary
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner has condemned approximately $5.8 billion in questionable payments made since fiscal year 2024, attributing the issue to a lack of strong financial controls under the Biden administration. A report from HUD flagged these potentially fraudulent payments, with about $1.5 billion in the Tenant Based Rental Assistance program and $4.3 billion in the Project Based Rental Assistance program. An analysis of four million tenant records revealed over 200,000 tenants with eligibility issues, including approximately $150 million paid to individuals with non-conforming Social Security numbers and $77 million to deceased tenants. HUD's Principal Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Irving Dennis, noted a decline in internal controls, poor record-keeping, and the removal of an effective governance structure for oversight. Despite the Trump administration's focus on federal spending transparency, it has also approved deficit-increasing legislation. The national debt has seen significant increases, surpassing $37 trillion and $38 trillion in 2025. HUD intends to investigate these findings and hold accountable those responsible for the misuse of taxpayer funds.
