## Article summary
In 2025, Colorado's legal marijuana sales surpassed $1 billion, generating nearly $200 million in tax and fee revenue for the state. Governor Jared Polis highlighted that Colorado's marijuana industry combats criminal activity, supports businesses and jobs, and funds school construction. Colorado was the first U.S. state to approve recreational marijuana sales in 2012 and has since collected over $3 billion in tax revenue from nearly $18 billion in sales. This revenue has funded infrastructure projects and public schools. Recently, President Donald Trump reclassified marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, a move applauded by Governor Polis as a step towards modernizing federal cannabis policies. Polis stated that Colorado's smart and safe cannabis policies have virtually eliminated illegal markets and ensured product safety. However, some express concerns about the potential impact of loosened federal restrictions, particularly regarding high-potency THC products. The Family Research Council noted that while fentanyl is targeted, marijuana restrictions are eased, citing Colorado's experience with increased traffic deaths, mental health issues, and emergency room visits as potential consequences.
