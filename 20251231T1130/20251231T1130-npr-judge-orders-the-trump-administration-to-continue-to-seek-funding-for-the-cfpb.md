## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to continue seeking funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency the administration has been attempting to dismantle. The administration argued that the CFPB could not be funded because the Federal Reserve, its funding source, was operating at a loss. Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected this argument, stating it would effectively shut down the agency. This ruling upholds a previous injunction aimed at preventing the closure of the CFPB. Separately, 21 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit to prevent the agency's defunding, challenging the administration's narrow interpretation of available Federal Reserve funds. The CFPB was established after the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from fraud and predatory practices. It has faced opposition from conservatives who view it as overly aggressive. The Trump administration had previously halted work at the agency and issued layoff notices to its employees, though these layoffs have been blocked by court orders. Judge Jackson noted that the agency's funding does not come from taxpayer dollars and that it has returned over $21 billion to consumers.
