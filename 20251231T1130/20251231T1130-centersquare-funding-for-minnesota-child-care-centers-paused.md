## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has paused taxpayer funding for Minnesota child care centers due to suspected fraud. Assistant Secretary Alex Adams stated that $185 million annually, intended for 19,000 children, may have been compromised. Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill criticized the state for allegedly allowing scammers to siphon millions over the past decade and demanded Governor Tim Walz conduct a thorough review. O'Neill emphasized that those involved in fraud will face prosecution. Allegations of fraud surfaced in November, with reports of millions stolen from the state's welfare system and sent to a Somali-based terror group. Independent journalist Nick Shirley further claimed $110 million in fraud at Minnesota child care centers. In response, HHS has implemented a mandatory verification process for all child care payments, requiring justification, receipts, or photo evidence. The department has also launched a hotline for reporting fraud in child care systems nationwide.
