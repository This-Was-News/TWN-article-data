## Article summary
Despite a challenging year marked by significant disruptions to global health funding and aid, 2025 saw notable advancements in public health. The Maldives achieved a triple elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B, with Brazil also being validated for eliminating HIV transmission from mothers to children. Three countries, Suriname, Timor-Leste, and Georgia, were certified malaria-free, and a new malaria vaccine was introduced in seven African nations. A significant development in HIV prevention was the approval and recommendation of lenacapavir, a long-acting injectable drug, with plans for generic manufacturing in low-income countries to promote health equity. Bangladesh reported a decline in childhood blood lead levels, partly due to educational efforts and new philanthropic initiatives. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine gained wider acceptance for a more accessible one-dose or two-dose protocol, a crucial step in preventing cervical cancer. Low-income countries like Mauritania and Senegal gained access to a six-in-one vaccine, simplifying childhood immunizations. Finally, Africa launched a genomic archiving platform to enhance its capacity for identifying and responding to infectious disease outbreaks, bolstering pandemic preparedness across the continent.
