## Article summary
Democrat Renee Hardman has won the Iowa Senate special election, securing a victory that prevents Republicans from achieving a supermajority in the state's upper chamber. Hardman defeated Republican Lucas Loftin by a significant margin of nearly 45 percentage points in the election for a seat representing Des Moines suburbs, which became vacant following the death of Democratic Senator Claire Celsi. This win increases the Democratic caucus's seats to 17, while Republicans maintain 33 seats. The Democratic Party had previously broken the GOP supermajority in an August special election, but Celsi's death shortly after nullified that gain. Had Loftin won, Republicans could have easily overridden gubernatorial vetoes and confirmed appointees without Democratic support. Hardman's victory ensures that Republican legislative actions will require at least one Democratic vote for confirmation of state nominees. The Democratic National Committee congratulated Hardman, highlighting her as the first Black woman elected to the Iowa Senate and emphasizing her commitment to working Iowans. This special election win is seen as part of a broader trend of Democratic victories and overperformance in special elections throughout 2025, positioning the party favorably for the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Iowa Auditor Rob Sand also noted the victory as a sign that Iowans are ready for change.
