## Article summary
The U.S.-Ukraine partnership has unraveled under Donald J. Trump's presidency, marked by on-again, off-again negotiations, internal administration conflicts, and continued war. Trump promised peace in Ukraine within a day, but this led to a year of complex diplomatic efforts and shifting U.S. policy. Key issues included the flow of crucial munitions, with the U.S. military's stocks and European allies' contributions becoming central to the debate. Secret U.S.-Ukraine intelligence and strategy partnerships, vital during the Biden administration, faced disruption. Trump's approach was characterized by a focus on personal relationships with leaders and a desire to broker a deal, often clashing with established foreign policy objectives. Internal disagreements within the Trump administration, particularly between those prioritizing Ukraine support and those focusing on China, created a "de facto anti-Ukraine policy." Despite these challenges, clandestine U.S. support for Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian energy facilities continued. Diplomatic efforts involved complex negotiations over territory, with Ukraine ultimately conceding significant land and facing pressure to accept Russian claims on Crimea. The narrative highlights the struggle to balance American interests, European responsibilities, and Ukraines sovereignty amidst a protracted conflict.
