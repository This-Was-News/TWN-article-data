## Article summary
Auckland, New Zealand, was the first major city to celebrate the arrival of 2026 with a dazzling fireworks display launched from the Sky Tower. Despite the festivities, rain dampened the celebrations in Auckland, leading to the cancellation of smaller community events across New Zealand's North Island. In Sydney, Australia, New Year's Eve celebrations were held under heightened security following the country's worst mass shooting, with a moment of silence and image projections honoring the victims. Indonesian cities scaled back their New Year's Eve events in solidarity with flood victims, opting for prayer and reflection instead of usual fanfare. Hong Kong also forewent its traditional fireworks display over Victoria Harbor due to a recent fatal fire, replacing it with a music and light show. Across Asia, traditions like bell striking at Buddhist temples in Japan and bell tolling ceremonies in Seoul marked the transition to the new year. Meanwhile, in New York, preparations were underway for the iconic Times Square ball drop, hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Rita Ora. The report also touches on other news, including SNAP bans on certain foods, political developments, and various lifestyle and science stories.
