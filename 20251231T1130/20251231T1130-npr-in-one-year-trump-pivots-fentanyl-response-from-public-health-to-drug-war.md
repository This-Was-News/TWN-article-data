## Article summary
In his first year back in office, President Trump has dramatically shifted the U.S. approach to combating fentanyl deaths, moving from a public health focus to a militarized "drug war." This pivot has involved dismantling Biden-era policies that experts credit with saving lives and slowing smuggling. The Biden administration had expanded addiction treatment, promoted harm reduction, and increased federal spending, leading to a significant decline in overdose deaths in 2023 and 2024. Trump, however, falsely claimed the Biden approach was a failure and implemented measures such as U.S. Naval strikes against alleged drug boats, designating cartels as terrorist organizations, and classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction. His administration also cut funding for addiction treatment programs and attacked harm reduction efforts, sparking fears of a resurgence in drug deaths. Despite claims of success, many of Trump's initiatives are based on inaccurate statistics, including exaggerated figures on overdose deaths and the role of Canada in fentanyl smuggling. Furthermore, pardons granted to significant drug figures send mixed signals that critics argue undermine the administration's stated goals. Experts express concern that these policy shifts, particularly the reduction in Medicaid funding for addiction care, could lead to increased overdose fatalities.
