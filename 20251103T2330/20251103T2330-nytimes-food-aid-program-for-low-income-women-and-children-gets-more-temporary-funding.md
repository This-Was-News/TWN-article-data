## Article summary
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which serves approximately 6.7 million low-income women and children, has received an additional $450 million in temporary funding from the Trump administration. This funding injection, sourced from customs revenue, aims to sustain the program amidst a government shutdown that has stretched into its second month. WIC provides monthly benefits including cash for produce, vouchers for dairy and eggs, nutrition support, and infant formula. This comes as the administration announced it would only fund partial benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in November. Advocates had initially warned that WIC could exhaust its funds by mid-October, but the Agriculture Department utilized Section 32 funds, typically used for child nutrition programs, to cover October's expenses. While the administration believes Section 32 has enough funds for WIC, it argues the same is not true for SNAP due to the larger funding needs. Despite WIC being spared the severe disruptions faced by SNAP, the ongoing funding uncertainty and temporary injections make it challenging for states and clinics to administer the program effectively. This has led to staffing shortages, reduced clinic hours, service interruptions, and delays in participant certification and benefit renewal. WIC advocates emphasize the need for long-term funding certainty beyond these stopgap measures to ensure consistent service delivery.
