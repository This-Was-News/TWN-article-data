## Article summary
The Trump administration announced it will partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) following judicial rulings that mandated its continuation. This decision comes after the administration had planned to halt payments due to the ongoing government shutdown, a move that would have impacted nearly 42 million Americans. While the partial funding ensures the program continues, the exact benefit amounts and the speed at which recipients will receive them remain unclear. Food banks and state governments have been preparing for potential disruptions, with some states implementing measures to reload benefit cards using state funds. In other news, a carriage dispute between Disney and YouTube TV has left subscribers without access to channels like ABC and ESPN, though Disney has requested a temporary reprieve for Election Day. President Trump has also weighed in on New York City's mayoral race, endorsing independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom is campaigning against a Trump-backed redistricting plan in Texas. The government shutdown continues, with Congressional leaders from both parties closely watching upcoming state and local elections for signs of voter sentiment. The deployment of National Guard members to Washington D.C. by some governors is also facing legal challenges. Separately, Microsoft has received approval to ship advanced AI chips to the UAE, a move that appears to contradict President Trump's previous statements on chip export restrictions. The ongoing shutdown is also straining operations at airports due to a shortage of air traffic controllers working without pay.
