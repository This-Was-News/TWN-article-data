## Article summary
Two Michigan men, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, have been charged with plotting a Halloween terrorist attack inspired by the Islamic State. The plot involved purchasing firearms, stockpiling ammunition, and coordinating via encrypted messaging. The F.B.I. became aware of the plot through an informant and an undercover officer. Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, announced the thwarting of the attack, with details later emerging through media reports citing unnamed sources. This incident follows previous attacks and attempted attacks linked to the Islamic State, including an incident in New Orleans and an attempted attack on a military base in Michigan. Court filings reveal that the accused individuals shared extremist content online and communicated with an Islamic State member in Syria. Photographs show the men purchasing and firing weapons. The plot may have been timed around Halloween, with "pumpkin" potentially used as a code word for the date. The affidavit suggests the individuals were scouting potential attack locations in Ferndale, a Detroit suburb, possibly targeting LGBTQ+-friendly venues, drawing a parallel to the 2015 Paris attacks.
