## Article summary
President Trump's deployments of National Guard troops to U.S. cities, ostensibly to combat crime, have raised legal and political concerns. An NPR review suggests these deployments align with a long-standing administration goal, championed by Stephen Miller, to use the military for mass deportations, potentially circumventing laws that restrict domestic policing by the military. This ambition is further reflected in the conservative action plan, Project 2025, which advocates for using federal resources to address immigration. Trump and Miller have repeatedly discussed invoking the Insurrection Act, which would grant the president broader authority to deploy military forces domestically for law enforcement purposes. Legal experts and activists express worry that such actions could fundamentally alter the role of the military on U.S. soil and potentially be used for voter suppression during the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. While past attempts to scale up mass deportation infrastructure faced challenges, Trump has vowed to launch an unprecedented deportation operation. The administration's rhetoric often conflates violent crime with illegal immigration, blurring the lines of the National Guard's traditional role. Critics fear that these deployments, if successful, could set a dangerous precedent for executive overreach and impact civil liberties, starting with immigrants but potentially extending to other groups.
