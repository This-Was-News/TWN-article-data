## Article summary
The former top military lawyer for the Israeli army, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, has resigned and is now in jail amid a scandal. The situation began when she approved the leak of a surveillance video showing alleged abuse of a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman military prison. Tomer-Yerushalmi intended the leak to highlight the seriousness of the investigation, but it drew criticism from hard-line politicians. Following her resignation, she disappeared, leaving a note for her family, which prompted a search fearing suicide. She was found alive on a Tel Aviv beach, after which accusations of staging a suicide attempt to destroy evidence emerged. Her detention has been extended as she faces suspicion of fraud, breach of trust, and obstruction of justice. The case involves allegations of severe abuse against a Palestinian detainee, the leak of evidence, and potential obstruction of the investigation. This episode highlights the deep divisions within Israel, exacerbated by the ongoing war, and the trend of top security officials being replaced by those loyal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. The fury over the leaked video has shifted focus from the abuse allegations themselves. The Palestinian detainee involved in the video was released as part of a prisoner exchange. Experts warn that the intense rhetoric and personal attacks mirror the pre-Oct. 7 period, potentially foreshadowing a return to internal strife in Israel.
