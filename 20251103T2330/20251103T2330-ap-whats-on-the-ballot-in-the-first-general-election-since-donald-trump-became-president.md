## Article summary
The first general election since Donald Trump became president features races where his influence is a central theme. Key contests include gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York City mayoral race, and a California proposition on redistricting. These elections are seen as a referendum on Trump's second-term agenda, with results expected to be interpreted as either a repudiation or an endorsement. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill faces Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Trump. Virginia's gubernatorial race pits Democrat Abigail Spanberger against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, with Trump's policies and past comments frequently discussed. The New York City mayoral election includes Democratic state legislator Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, with Trump having expressed a desire to see Mamdani defeated. California voters will decide on a measure to redraw congressional districts, a move seen as a response to Republican redistricting efforts in Texas aimed at bolstering Trump's party control. The control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is also at stake, with potential implications for future presidential election disputes. Additionally, special elections for a congressional seat in Texas and state legislative control in Minnesota and Virginia are on the ballot, alongside various local mayoral races and ballot measures across several states, including Maine, Texas, Colorado, and Washington.
