## Article summary
Brown University President Christina Paxson has confirmed the identities of two undergraduate students killed in a mass shooting: Ella Cook, a sophomore, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a freshman. The shooting occurred during a final exam-review session, and the shooter remains at large. Nine other students were injured, most of whom are reported to be in stable condition. Ella Cook, from Alabama, was involved in her church community, was a member of Alpha Chi Omega, and served as vice president of the university's Republican Club. Mukhammad Umurzokov, a dual U.S. citizen from Uzbekistan, was known for his ambition to become a neurosurgeon and planned to concentrate in biochemistry and molecular biology. A fellow student described Umurzokov as a significant presence on campus due to his kindness and outgoing nature. In response to the tragedy, most classes, exams, and final papers at Brown University have been canceled. The university is considering plans for a spring semester memorial service. The manhunt for the gunman is ongoing, with authorities releasing new images of the person they believe is responsible.
