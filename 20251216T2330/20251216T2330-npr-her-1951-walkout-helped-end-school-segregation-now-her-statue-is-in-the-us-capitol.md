## Article summary
A statue of Barbara Rose Johns, a teenager who led a student walkout in 1951 to protest segregated and inferior schooling in Farmville, Virginia, has been unveiled at the U.S. Capitol. Her activism was instrumental in the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, which declared school segregation unconstitutional in 1954. Johns' bronze statue now stands in Emancipation Hall, replacing that of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The decision to select Johns was made by Virginia's Commission on Historical Statues in the United States Capitol in 2020, following a nationwide reckoning with racial injustice and the removal of Confederate symbols. The 11-foot statue, created by artist Steven Weitzman, depicts a teenage Johns rallying students. Her walkout, which lasted two weeks, drew the attention of the NAACP, leading to a lawsuit that, while initially unsuccessful in federal court, contributed to the eventual Supreme Court ruling. Prince Edward County schools were finally integrated in 1964 after being closed for five years to resist integration. Johns, who passed away in 1991, pursued a career as a librarian after completing her education. Her legacy is recognized in Virginia through educational curricula and the annual observance of Barbara Johns Day. The unveiling of her statue is seen as an effort by Virginia to acknowledge and rectify past inequities. This event occurs amidst a broader national conversation about historical representation and diversity in public monuments.
