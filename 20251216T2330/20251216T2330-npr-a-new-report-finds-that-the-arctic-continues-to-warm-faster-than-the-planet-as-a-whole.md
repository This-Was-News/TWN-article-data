## Article summary
The latest Arctic Report Card from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reveals that the Arctic is warming at a rate exceeding the global average. This accelerated warming is causing significant environmental changes, including the phenomenon of 'rusting rivers' where thawing permafrost releases iron and other metals into waterways, turning them orange. This year marked the warmest and wettest in the Arctic's recorded history, with melting glaciers contributing to rising global sea levels and increased coastal flooding risks. The report also highlights the 'Atlantification' of the Arctic Ocean, characterized by warmer, saltier waters, which has led to record low sea ice extent. These changes are impacting marine ecosystems, affecting commercially important fish species and disrupting traditional hunting and fishing practices in the region. The report, compiled by an independent network of scientists, underscores the critical need for sustained observations to understand and address the rapid changes occurring in the Arctic. Despite political shifts regarding climate research, NOAA has affirmed its commitment to this vital work. The findings serve as a stark reminder of the Arctic's role as the planet's 'refrigerator' and the far-reaching consequences of its warming.
