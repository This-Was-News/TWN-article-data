## Article summary
White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has drawn significant attention following candid remarks made in a Vanity Fair profile. In the interviews, Wiles offered critical assessments of Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and provided her perspective on President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Wiles described Trump as having an "alcoholics personality" and Vance as a "calculating conspiracy theorist." She also revealed that Trump's campaign against alleged drug boats off Venezuela's coast is intended to oust leader Nicolás Maduro. Following the publication, Wiles pushed back, labeling the article a "hit piece" that lacked context and omitted crucial information. However, she did not deny the quotes attributed to her. President Trump stated he hadn't read the piece but expressed confidence in Wiles, acknowledging he has a "very possessive and addictive type personality." Vice President Vance defended Wiles, emphasizing her loyalty to the president. The profile highlighted Wiles's typically behind-the-scenes approach to her role, contrasting with her unusual candor in these interviews. The article also touched upon Wiles's acknowledgment of mistakes in Trump's mass deportation program and his retribution campaign against political enemies.
