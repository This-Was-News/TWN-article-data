## Article summary
Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of filmmaker Rob Reiner and photographer Michele Singer Reiner, is being charged with two counts of first-degree murder. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office announced the charges, which include a "special circumstance" of multiple murders and the allegation that a knife was used as a deadly weapon. These charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, though a decision on the death penalty has not been made. The deaths of Rob and Michele Singer Reiner were discovered on Sunday after a call from the fire department. Nick Reiner was arrested in the Exposition Park area of Los Angeles on Sunday. While Reiner has been open about past struggles with addiction, officials could not confirm if he was under the influence at the time of his arrest. The District Attorney emphasized that charges are not evidence and that any relevant information, including potential mental illness or admissions, would be presented in court. The family's wishes will be considered in the legal proceedings. Nick Reiner is currently undergoing medical clearance and is being held without bail pending his arraignment.
