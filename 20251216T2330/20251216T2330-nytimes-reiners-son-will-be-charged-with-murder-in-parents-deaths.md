## Article summary
Prosecutors in Los Angeles have announced they will charge Nick Reiner with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of his parents, acclaimed Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner. The couple was found stabbed to death in their home on Sunday. Nick Reiner, 32, was arrested without incident on Sunday night. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole or the death penalty, though prosecutors have not yet decided on seeking the latter. Nick Reiner has publicly struggled with drug abuse and homelessness since his teenage years, a journey that was loosely depicted in a film he co-wrote with his father, titled "Being Charlie." Reports indicate that Rob and Nick Reiner had an argument at a holiday party the night before the bodies were discovered. Nick Reiner's lawyer, Alan Jackson, is a prominent defense attorney who has represented high-profile clients. The district attorney emphasized the challenging nature of prosecuting cases involving family members and cautioned against speculation. Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama expressed their shock and sadness, noting they had plans to see the couple on the day they were found dead. President Trump made controversial remarks following the news, attacking Rob Reiner's political views.
