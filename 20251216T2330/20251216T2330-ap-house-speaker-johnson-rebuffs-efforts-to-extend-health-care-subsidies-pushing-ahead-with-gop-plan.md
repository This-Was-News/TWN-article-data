## Article summary
House Speaker Mike Johnson has decided against extending pandemic-era health care subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year, impacting millions of Americans who will face higher insurance premiums. Despite discussions about allowing a vote on an extension, leadership sided with conservative Republicans who oppose these subsidies. The House Republicans are moving forward with their own health care bill, focusing on expanding insurance options for small businesses and the self-employed, and regulating pharmacy benefit managers. This GOP package is projected to decrease the number of insured individuals annually while reducing the federal deficit. Some Republicans, like Rep. Mike Lawler, have criticized the decision not to extend the subsidies, calling it "political malpractice." Democrats argue that the Republican bill is not a serious attempt to address rising costs and could cost the GOP their majority. Meanwhile, in the Senate, a bipartisan group is still exploring potential compromises for extending the subsidies, with discussions possibly continuing into January. These senators are considering a two-year extension with reforms and the inclusion of new health savings accounts. However, disagreements, particularly over abortion funding, remain significant obstacles. The expiration of the ACA subsidies means many Americans will experience substantially higher insurance costs in 2026, while the Senate works towards a potential solution after the holiday break.
