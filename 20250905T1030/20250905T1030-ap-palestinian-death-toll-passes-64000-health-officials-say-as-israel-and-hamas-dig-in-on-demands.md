## Article summary
The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 64,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, as the war between Israel and Hamas continues with no signs of a ceasefire. Recent Israeli airstrikes killed 28 people, mostly women and children, in Gaza City, which is under Israeli military control. Hamas has offered to release remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a ceasefire, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, but Israel has dismissed the offer, insisting on the return of all hostages and disarmament of Hamas. Meanwhile, Israel has established a new settlement in the Palestinian city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, which is seen as an obstacle to peace. The conflict has displaced many Palestinians, and the international community views Israeli settlements as illegal. The situation remains tense with no immediate resolution in sight.
