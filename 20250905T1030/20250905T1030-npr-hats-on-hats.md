## Article summary
The article discusses the Trump administration's practice of assigning multiple high-level jobs to officials. Secretary of State Marco Rubo, for instance, holds four roles, including acting national security advisor and acting archivist. President Trump has a pattern of giving officials multiple significant positions, with at least a dozen officials serving in two or more roles. Critics argue this approach is inefficient and overwhelming, while the White House defends it as promoting better communication and collaboration. Notable officials with multiple roles include Richard Grenell, who oversees various tasks, and Russell Vought, who manages the Office of Management and Budget and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The article highlights the unprecedented nature of these multiple roles and the potential implications for government efficiency and effectiveness.
