## Article summary
The web page discusses the powers and limitations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during arrests. ICE agents can arrest and question immigrants without warrants if they have reasonable suspicion that the person is in the U.S. illegally and likely to escape. However, recent practices, such as large-scale dragnets and arrests based on perceived race or ethnicity, have been challenged in court. Agents are allowed to wear masks, but this practice has raised concerns about transparency and compliance with federal requirements to identify themselves. Arrests can occur in public spaces but require warrants for private homes or businesses. ICE agents can use force when necessary, but the criteria for 'objectively reasonable' force are unclear. The page also highlights controversies surrounding the use of force, such as smashing car windows, and the rights of bystanders to record these interactions.
