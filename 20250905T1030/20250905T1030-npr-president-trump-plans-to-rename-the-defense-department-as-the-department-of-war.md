## Article summary
President Trump plans to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War through an executive order. This change would revert the department to a name it carried for much of its history before becoming the Department of Defense after World War II. The executive order, confirmed by a White House official, will make 'Department of War' a secondary title for the Department of Defense. It will also allow Defense Department officials to use the word 'war' in their titles, such as Secretary of War. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth acknowledged the change on social media. Trump has previously expressed his preference for the name 'War Department,' stating it 'just sounded better.' While the legal authority for the change is unclear, Trump believes Congress will support it if needed. The War Department was the original name for the military oversight agency until it was renamed in 1949 under President Harry Truman. The cost of changing signs, seals, and titles could be significant, as a similar effort to rename Army bases cost $39 million in 2023.
