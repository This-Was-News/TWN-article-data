## Article summary
President Trump placed Washington, D.C. police under federal control and deployed the National Guard to combat crime, claiming significant success. Over 1,600 arrests have been made since August 7, with many related to immigration offenses. NPR analyzed court records from August 11 to August 25, finding that nearly 1,100 defendants faced charges in Superior Court, with 20% charged with felonies. Prosecutors dropped around 17% of cases in the first week and less than 1% in the second week. At least 35 federal cases were filed, with most involving gun or drug charges. Some cases involved minor offenses, such as throwing a sandwich at an officer or spitting on National Guard troops. Several cases have been dismissed due to illegal searches or grand jury rejections, raising questions about law enforcement overreach. Judges and grand juries have criticized some prosecutions, highlighting potential issues with the aggressive law enforcement approach.
