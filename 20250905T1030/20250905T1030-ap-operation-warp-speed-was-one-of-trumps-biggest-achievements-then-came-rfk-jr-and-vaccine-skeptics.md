## Article summary
President Donald Trump's Operation Warp Speed, launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, is credited with saving millions of lives and is considered one of his greatest achievements. However, this success is contrasted by the stance of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic who has faced criticism for his efforts to restrict vaccine access, including the COVID-19 shots championed by Trump. During a congressional hearing, Democrats praised Operation Warp Speed as a monumental achievement, while Republicans criticized Kennedy's approach to vaccines. Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician, highlighted the success of Operation Warp Speed and questioned Kennedy's consistency in supporting the president's vaccine efforts. Kennedy defended his actions, denying allegations and emphasizing the need for integrity in the vaccine review process. The administration defended Kennedy, accusing Democrats of playing politics. Meanwhile, Trump acknowledged Kennedy's good intentions but remained non-committal on the vaccine issue. The hearing exposed a growing divide within Trump's base, with some supporters distrusting the mRNA vaccine technology that Operation Warp Speed championed. Despite the controversy, Trump continues to tout Operation Warp Speed as an incredible accomplishment, urging his supporters to take credit for the historic effort.
