## Article summary
President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order to rebrand the Department of Defense as the Department of War, aiming to project a tougher image for the U.S. military. The change, which requires congressional approval, will initially allow the Pentagon to use the original name as a secondary title. The Department of War was established in 1789 and renamed in 1947. Pentagon Chief Pete Hegseth has been a proponent of this change, hinting at a title change during public events. Trump has expressed his preference for the historical name, citing its association with military victories. The move is part of a series of cultural changes Hegseth has implemented, including the removal of diversity programs and materials deemed divisive from military libraries and websites. This has led to the removal of hundreds of books and thousands of websites honoring contributions by women and minority groups. Hegseth has also overseen the removal of transgender troops from the military following an executive order from Trump.
