## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of increased deportations and immigration crackdowns on businesses in Florida, particularly in the restaurant and construction industries. Cesar Zapata, a chef with four restaurants in Miami, initially benefited from immigrant workers filling labor shortages post-pandemic. However, recent immigration laws and deportations have made it difficult to find workers willing to accept his offered wages. The article highlights a delicate balance in the economy where slow job growth is offset by the expulsion of immigrants, keeping the unemployment rate stable. In Florida, increased deportation-related arrests have coincided with a cooling job market due to economic uncertainties and rising living costs. Immigrant workers, who are crucial to various industries, face heightened risks of detention and deportation, affecting their willingness to work. The article also notes the broader economic implications, including potential labor shortages if the economy revives while deportations continue. Business owners express concerns about finding workers, even with higher wages, as American-born workers often prefer other jobs. The situation underscores the complex interplay between immigration policies and labor market dynamics.
