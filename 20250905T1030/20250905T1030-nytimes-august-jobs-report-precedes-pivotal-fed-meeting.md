## Article summary
The August jobs report is highly anticipated following last month's downward revisions to job growth. Analysts expect around 75,000 jobs were added in August, which is the break-even rate. The Trump administration's policies, including tariffs and federal spending, have made interpreting economic data challenging. The unemployment rate has remained steady due to fewer people available to work. However, job openings have fallen sharply, especially in healthcare. Data from ADP showed only 54,000 private-sector jobs were added in August, suggesting the total number could be lower. Consumer confidence in job availability is at its lowest since early 2021. Businesses are finding it easier to fill roles and are less likely to raise pay. Wages may start to lag behind price growth, potentially slowing spending. Households are particularly concerned about their employment situation, with low confidence in their job security.
