## Article summary
A top-secret SEAL Team 6 mission into North Korea in early 2019 aimed to plant a listening device to intercept Kim Jong-un's communications and aid negotiations with President Trump. The mission, approved by Trump, was highly risky and required precise execution. Despite months of preparation, the mission failed when a North Korean boat appeared, leading the SEALs to open fire and retreat without planting the device. The operation remains classified, and its details are revealed here for the first time. The mission's failure was attributed to a series of small mistakes and unforeseen circumstances. The incident raised concerns about the secrecy surrounding Special Operations failures and the risks undertaken by American forces. The mission's aftermath saw increased North Korean military activity, and subsequent talks between Trump and Kim yielded no significant progress. The mission's failure prompted reviews within the military, but the Trump administration did not notify key congressional members, potentially violating the law. The SEALs' track record includes both high-profile successes and notable failures, highlighting the complexities and risks of such operations.
