## Article summary
PBS is cutting 15% of its jobs due to the elimination of federal funding by Republicans in Congress, effective October 1. Thirty-four staffers were notified of their job cuts, and with previous reductions, over 100 jobs will be lost. PBS's CEO, Paula Kerger, stated that the organization faces a 21% revenue hit and must make difficult choices. The cuts result from Congress's rescission of $1.1 billion in planned public media expenditures and the Trump administration's decision to cancel a major education grant. Despite some foundation support, significant changes in staffing and operations are necessary. All areas of PBS will be affected, following initial cuts to travel and merit pay evaluations. PBS and its stations typically receive 15% of their funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Other public media stations, like KQED and GBH, have also conducted layoffs. NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, plans to reduce the network's budget by $8 million to assist affected stations, but the full financial impact remains uncertain. Some stations, especially those serving rural and Native American audiences, rely heavily on federal funding and may face closure.
