## Article summary
House members reflected on the longest government shutdown in recent history, which lasted 54 days. The House of Representatives approved a stopgap funding bill to end the shutdown, marking their first vote after being adjourned for over seven weeks. Speaker Mike Johnson had sent members home in mid-September after passing an initial continuing resolution, stating the House would reconvene when the Senate allowed for reopening. Upon their return, tensions were high, with Democrats criticizing Republicans for being on vacation while the government was shut down. Some Republicans, like Rep. Kevin Kiley, felt the lack of legislative session was a "not the finest hour" for Congress, hindering progress on crucial issues like ACA subsidies. Others, such as Rep. Mark Alford, found the time spent in their districts productive for understanding constituents' needs. Democrats expressed frustration with Speaker Johnson's judgment, calling the adjournment "disrespectful" and "poor form," especially as new members like Adelita Grijalva waited to be sworn in. Rep. Melanie Stansbury highlighted that significant legislative business could have been conducted during the shutdown, leading to public anger over a lack of accountability. Rep. Steve Womack agreed that members were gone "far too long" and expressed concern about future spending bills, hoping Congress would not repeat the same process.
