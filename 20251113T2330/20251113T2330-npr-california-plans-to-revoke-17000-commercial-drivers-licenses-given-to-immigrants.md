## Article summary
California is planning to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses issued to immigrants after discovering that their expiration dates extended beyond the period of legal residency in the U.S. This decision follows criticism from U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who highlighted concerns about states issuing licenses to individuals not authorized to be in the country. Duffy stated that California's action is an admission of improper licensing, despite previous defenses of their standards. Governor Newsom's office countered that all affected drivers possessed valid federal work authorizations and that the revocation is based on a state law requiring licenses to align with legal status duration. The issue gained national attention after a fatal crash in Florida involving a driver in the U.S. illegally. Duffy has previously imposed stricter rules for commercial licenses for immigrants and has threatened to withhold federal funding from California if all improperly issued licenses are not invalidated. While the state is complying with the revocation, Newsom's office maintains they followed federal guidance. The new federal rules significantly limit eligibility for commercial licenses to specific visa holders and require verification of immigration status, though these rules are not retroactive for existing license holders.
