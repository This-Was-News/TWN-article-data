## Article summary
Following the end of a U.S. government shutdown, states are rushing to disburse full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) food benefits to millions of people. The shutdown had created a complex situation with partial or no benefits issued for November due to shifting policies and court rulings. The USDA has now directed states to promptly ensure households receive their complete November allotments. SNAP serves approximately 42 million Americans, with benefits averaging around $190 per person monthly. To address the uncertainty, the USDA waived work requirements for November. Many states are working to load full benefits onto electronic cards by Friday, with some already having done so. This delay caused significant stress and uncertainty for recipients, who sometimes rely on food pantries and other aid. The situation arose after the USDA initially stated it would not fund November SNAP benefits amid the shutdown, leading to lawsuits and a series of legal decisions. The recent government reopening legislation ensures full SNAP benefits through the federal fiscal year, resolving the immediate funding crisis.
