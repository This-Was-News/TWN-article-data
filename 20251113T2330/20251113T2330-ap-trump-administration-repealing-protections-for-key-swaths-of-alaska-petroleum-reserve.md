## Article summary
The Trump administration is rescinding federal rules that protected large areas of Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve from oil and gas leasing. These protected areas are crucial habitats for wildlife like caribou and migrating birds. The Interior Department announced the repeal of rules established last year by the Biden administration, which had restricted development in ecologically sensitive zones. This move aligns with an executive order by President Trump aimed at undoing Biden-era policies that Alaska's leaders argued hindered energy development. The Biden-era rules also mandated regular evaluations for new protections, citing climate change impacts on the Arctic. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated the Biden rules conflicted with the reserve's leasing mandate. There's a long-standing debate over development in the reserve, with supporters emphasizing its name and opponents advocating for environmental balance. The reserve, established for the Navy's emergency oil supply, has been managed by the Interior Department since the 1970s. While the Biden administration approved the large Willow oil project, environmental groups criticize the Trump administration's decision as a reckless step backward for responsible resource management.
