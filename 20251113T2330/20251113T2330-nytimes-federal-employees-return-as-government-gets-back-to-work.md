## Article summary
The Trump administration is considering broad tariff exemptions on certain imported food products to combat rising consumer prices, according to sources familiar with the matter. This move comes after recent Democratic election victories, where affordability was a key campaign issue. The proposed exemptions would extend beyond previous proposals and could include items like beef and citrus, potentially impacting countries that have not yet struck trade deals with the U.S. Some within the administration, like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have advocated for these exemptions due to high prices, while others worry about alienating domestic producers such as ranchers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that significant announcements regarding tariff exemptions would be made soon, targeting goods not produced domestically. The administration's efforts to lower food prices are a response to concerns about the economy and have been influenced by a dip in consumer confidence. While the exact impact of these exemptions on U.S. prices remains uncertain, the administration believes it can now implement these changes following the completion of several new trade agreements. These new deals, including those with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador, aim to open markets and secure access to critical minerals. Discussions are also ongoing with countries like Switzerland, Taiwan, and India regarding potential trade pacts and tariff reductions.
