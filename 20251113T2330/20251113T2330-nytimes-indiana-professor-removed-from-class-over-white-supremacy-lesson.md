## Article summary
A professor at Indiana University, Jessica Adams, has been removed from teaching her "Diversity, Human Rights and Social Justice" class. This action followed a complaint filed by a student with Senator Jim Banks after Professor Adams showed students a graphic that identified the "Make America Great Again" slogan as an example of covert white supremacy. The graphic is a common illustration depicting various forms of white supremacy. Senator Banks contacted the university, leading to the suspension of Professor Adams from the class. While Ms. Adams continues to teach three other courses, she awaits the outcome of an investigation into the incident. She expressed concern for her job security but also spoke out about the issues of censorship, academic freedom, and legislative overreach. The new Indiana law, aimed at promoting intellectual diversity, is cited as a factor in the university's decision.
