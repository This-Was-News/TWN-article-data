## Article summary
Home insurance costs are soaring in the Midwest, a region not typically associated with major climate disasters like wildfires or hurricanes. This rise is primarily driven by increasingly frequent and severe hailstorms, which cause significant property damage. Towns like Cozad, Nebraska, have experienced devastating hailstorms, with softball-sized hail damaging nearly every building, vehicle, and roof. These localized but costly events are leading to substantial payouts for insurance companies. Researchers indicate that the weather conditions conducive to large hail are becoming more common, particularly in the Great Plains, as the planet warms. This escalating risk is reflected in rising insurance premiums, with some areas in the Northern Plains paying up to 20% more than the national average. Beyond hail, increased labor and construction material costs are also contributing factors to higher insurance prices. While the insurance industry has seen increased profits, many homeowners, especially seniors on fixed incomes, are struggling with unaffordable premiums and reduced coverage. Deductibles are rising, and policies often no longer cover the full cost of repairs, forcing homeowners to bear more of the financial burden.
