## Article summary
The U.S. stock market experienced one of its worst days since April, with the S&P 500 falling 1.7% and the Nasdaq composite dropping 2.3%. This downturn was largely driven by concerns over the high valuations of AI stocks, particularly Nvidia, which fell 3.6%. Other AI-related companies like Super Micro Computer and Palantir also saw significant declines. Investors are worried that the rapid rise in AI stock prices is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. Adding to the market's woes were doubts about the Federal Reserve's future interest rate cuts. Traders have reduced their expectations for a December rate cut, influenced by recent comments from Fed officials and the uncertainty caused by the U.S. government shutdown. The shutdown delayed crucial economic data, making it harder for the Fed to assess whether inflation or a slowing job market is the greater concern. This data uncertainty could lead to further market volatility. In other market news, The Walt Disney Co. fell 7.7% despite reporting better-than-expected profits, as its revenue missed analyst estimates. Conversely, Cisco Systems rose 4.6% on strong earnings, and Berkshire Hathaway gained 2.1%. Globally, stock markets in Europe declined, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 saw a modest increase. Bitcoin also experienced a price drop, falling below $99,000.
