## Article summary
New emails released in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal have reignited sexual assault allegations against the former Prince Andrew. In a 2011 email, a sender identified as "The Duke" wrote to Epstein, "I cant take any more of this," expressing distress over the unfolding situation. These emails further undermine Prince Andrew's previous denials of ever meeting his accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. The documents suggest Epstein and Prince Andrew worked together to discredit Giuffre's claims. Epstein's emails describe Giuffre as a "liar" and a "telephone answerer," and he discussed investigating her with a reporter. Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was stripped of his royal titles and faces eviction from his home. His public downfall intensified after emails revealed his friendship with Epstein lasted longer than he admitted, and after Giuffre's posthumous memoir detailed their alleged encounters. The newly released emails also contradict Prince Andrew's claim that a photo of him with Giuffre was doctored, as Epstein confirmed Giuffre was on his plane and had her picture taken with him. Epstein's correspondence also included disparaging remarks about Giuffre and suggestions for dealing with media inquiries. The situation has led to significant personal and public repercussions for the former Duke of York.
