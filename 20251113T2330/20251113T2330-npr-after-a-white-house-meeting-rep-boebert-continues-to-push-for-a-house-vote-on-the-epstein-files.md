## Article summary
Rep. Lauren Boebert has maintained her support for a discharge petition aimed at compelling the release of Jeffrey Epstein's investigative files, despite a recent meeting with Trump Administration officials. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt confirmed the meeting was about transparency, stating that the administration was willing to brief members of Congress on their concerns. Boebert asserted that she felt no pressure during the meeting and expressed her desire to honor President Trump's legacy of transparency. She is one of four Republicans who joined the bipartisan petition, led by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, which now has the required 218 signatures to force a House vote. Earlier, former President Trump criticized Republicans supporting the petition on social media, calling it a deflection from Democratic failures. Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the bill will be brought to the House floor for a vote next week. However, passage in the Senate and a signature from Trump, who has called the effort the "Epstein Hoax," are not guaranteed.
