## Article summary
Senate Democrats are prepared to vote for a government shutdown if they don't receive significant concessions on health care before the funding deadline. This strategy is supported by many Democratic voters and activists, who were frustrated by previous Democratic support for keeping the government open. The outcome of a shutdown is uncertain, with Democrats betting that Republicans will bear the blame and eventually compromise. Republicans, however, show no signs of relenting and hold the majority in both the House and Senate. Democrats view the situation as a difficult choice, with the country's condition worsening regardless of a shutdown. An extended shutdown could lead to mass firings of federal workers, escalating the annual spending battles. Democrats criticize Republicans for not negotiating and passing a tax bill that cut Medicaid spending. They also condemn Trump for canceling a meeting with Democratic leaders. Most Senate Democrats are united in threatening a shutdown, but some may vote to keep the government open. The Democratic base is frustrated and sees this as a chance to recast the party's image. Democrats are determined not to yield, even if it means federal layoffs, viewing it as a fight worth having.
