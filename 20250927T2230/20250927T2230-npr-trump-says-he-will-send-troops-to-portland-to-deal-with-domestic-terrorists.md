## Article summary
President Trump announced on Saturday that he would send troops to Portland, Oregon, describing the city as 'war ravaged' and citing the need to protect ICE facilities from what he called 'domestic terrorists' like antifa. He directed Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to provide necessary troops, though the Pentagon has not issued a deployment order and only learned of the request from the media. Local officials in Portland dispute Trump's claims about the city's safety and urge residents to remain peaceful. Earlier this week, a gunman attacked an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, killing one detainee. Trump recently signed an executive order designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, though no such classification exists under U.S. law. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor both stated there is no national security threat in Portland and that the deployment of troops would be unnecessary. Trump has previously deployed troops to other Democratic-run cities despite data showing decreases in violent crime. Oregon officials have not been informed of any military mission.
