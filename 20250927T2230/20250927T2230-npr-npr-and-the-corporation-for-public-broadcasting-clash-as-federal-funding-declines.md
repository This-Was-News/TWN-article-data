## Article summary
NPR has filed a lawsuit to block the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) from awarding a $57.9 million grant to a new consortium to operate the public radio satellite system. This dispute arises amid declining federal funding for public broadcasting, with Republicans and President Trump pushing to eliminate subsidies. NPR, which has managed the satellite system for over 40 years, alleges that CPB reversed its initial approval of NPR's contract extension due to political pressure. The new consortium, Public Media Infrastructure, includes New York Public Radio, PRX, American Public Media, and others. NPR argues that CPB's decision undermines the stability of public radio and violates the First Amendment. Meanwhile, CPB maintains that its decision supports the broader public media system. NPR is also suing the White House over Trump's order banning CPB from funding NPR, citing viewpoint discrimination. The dispute highlights tensions within public media as federal funding is set to expire. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing on NPR's motion for a temporary restraining order.
