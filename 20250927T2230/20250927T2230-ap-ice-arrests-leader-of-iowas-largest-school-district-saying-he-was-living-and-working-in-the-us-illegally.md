## Article summary
Federal immigration agents arrested Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Iowa's largest school district, after a traffic stop. Roberts, originally from Guyana, was found to be in the U.S. illegally and had a final removal order issued in 2024. He fled into the woods but was later apprehended with a loaded handgun, cash, and a knife. The district claimed they had no knowledge of his immigration status or removal order. Roberts was a well-liked leader, overseeing a district with over 30,000 students. ICE officials criticized the district for hiring him despite his lack of work authorization and prior weapons charge. The arrest shocked the community, with protests held in Des Moines and Iowa City. Roberts had previously worked as a superintendent in Pennsylvania and had a minor weapons charge in 2022. The district's spokesperson confirmed awareness of the charge but stated it had been addressed. This incident follows another ICE operation in Iowa City that also sparked outrage.
