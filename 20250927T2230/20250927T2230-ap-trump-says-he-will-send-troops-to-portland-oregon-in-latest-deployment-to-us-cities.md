## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced plans to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to address what he described as domestic terrorism, particularly targeting Antifa and protecting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek strongly opposed the move, asserting that Portland is managing its public safety needs without federal intervention. Kotek emphasized that there is no insurrection or threat to national security, and local officials, including Mayor Keith Wilson, echoed her sentiments. Trump's announcement lacked specific details on the timeline or the troops involved. Meanwhile, residents and protesters in Portland expressed disbelief and opposition to the deployment, highlighting the city's peaceful state. Recent protests have been minimal and focused around the ICE building, which has been boarded up due to past incidents. The city has seen improvements in downtown recovery and a decrease in violent crime. Trump's actions are part of his broader strategy to confront what he labels as the radical left, following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The Oregon congressional delegation, except for one Republican, condemned the deployment as an abuse of executive authority. The Pentagon and Oregon National Guard await further instructions, while local officials urge calm and resist the federal presence.
