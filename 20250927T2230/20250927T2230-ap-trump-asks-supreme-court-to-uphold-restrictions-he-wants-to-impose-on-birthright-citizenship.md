## Article summary
President Donald Trump's administration is appealing to the Supreme Court to uphold his executive order restricting birthright citizenship for children born to parents in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. The order, signed at the start of Trump's second term, challenges the 14th Amendment's long-standing interpretation that grants citizenship to all born on American soil. Lower courts have blocked the order, deeming it unconstitutional, and the administration is now seeking a definitive ruling from the Supreme Court. The appeal, shared with the Associated Press, highlights the administration's view that the order is crucial for border security. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argues the order is illegal and unconstitutional, vowing to protect affected children's citizenship. The Supreme Court's decision on whether to take up the case is months away, with arguments likely in late winter or early spring. The administration is appealing two cases, including one where a nationwide injunction was deemed necessary to prevent inconsistencies in birthright citizenship policies across states. The 14th Amendment, intended to secure citizenship for formerly enslaved people, is at the heart of the legal dispute. The administration contends that children of noncitizens are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction and thus not entitled to citizenship.
