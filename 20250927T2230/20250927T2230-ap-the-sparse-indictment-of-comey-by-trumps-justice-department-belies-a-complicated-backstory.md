## Article summary
The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey by Trump's Justice Department is brief, alleging he falsely testified to Congress in 2020 about authorizing an anonymous source in news stories. The case stems from heavily scrutinized investigations into Russia's involvement in the 2016 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's private email server. The indictment claims Comey lied about not authorizing anonymous sources, specifically involving an interaction with Sen. Ted Cruz. The testimony in question revolves around the role of Comey's deputy, Andy McCabe, in leaking information to The Wall Street Journal. The indictment's brevity leaves many details unclear, including the identity of 'Person 3' and the specific evidence to be presented at trial. Comey has acknowledged using a friend, Daniel Richman, as a conduit to the media in other matters. The case is part of a long-running feud between Trump and Comey, with Trump accusing Comey of starting the Russia investigation. Both have publicly criticized each other, with Comey comparing Trump to a mafia don. Comey maintains his innocence and expresses confidence in the judicial system.
