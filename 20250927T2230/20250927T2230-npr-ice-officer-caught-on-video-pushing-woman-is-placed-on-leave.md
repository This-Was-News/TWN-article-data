## Article summary
An ICE officer in New York has been placed on administrative leave after a video showed him pushing a woman to the ground. The incident occurred at the Jacob K. Javits building at 26 Federal Plaza. The officer's conduct was deemed unacceptable by the Department of Homeland Security, which is conducting a full investigation. This follows growing tensions between federal law enforcement and the public in immigration courts. ICE has increased its presence in courthouses, leading to conflicts and arrests. In August, an NPR reporter and a court observer were involved in a heated exchange with an ICE agent. The court observer was later cited for trespassing and failing to follow lawful commands. The recent video shows a woman crying after her husband's arrest, with the officer yelling 'adios' before pushing her. The incident has highlighted ongoing issues with ICE's actions in courthouses.
