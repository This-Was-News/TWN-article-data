## Article summary
President Trump's campaign of retribution intensified in mid-July, culminating in the indictment of James Comey, his former F.B.I. director. Lindsey Halligan, the new U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, faced challenges in her first days, including indicting Comey. The indictment followed a series of White House actions that undermined the Justice Department's independence. Trump's frustration over the slow pace of investigations was fueled by advisers like William J. Pulte. The U.S. attorneys office in Alexandria, Virginia, experienced chaos as career prosecutors scrambled for news. Trump's public demand for Attorney General Pam Bondi to act quickly led to the resignation of Erik S. Siebert, who believed the evidence against Comey was insufficient. Halligan secured the indictment despite internal doubts and procedural mishaps. Comey defiantly declared his innocence in a video. More indictments against Trump's targets are expected, including potential charges against John R. Bolton and investigations into other political figures. The Justice Department's actions have raised concerns about the politicization of law enforcement.
