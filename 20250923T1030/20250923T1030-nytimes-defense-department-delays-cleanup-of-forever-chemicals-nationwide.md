## Article summary
The Department of Defense has postponed the cleanup of harmful 'forever chemicals' (PFAS) at nearly 140 military sites nationwide, potentially delaying cleanup efforts by nearly a decade in some areas. These chemicals, widely used in military firefighting foam, have been linked to serious health risks, including cancers and developmental issues. The Pentagon's revised timeline, released in March 2025, significantly deviates from its earlier cleanup plan. The delays come amid potential funding cuts for toxic-site cleanups, despite the military's $2.6 billion investment since 2017 to address contamination. The Defense Department, now referred to as the Department of War by the Trump administration, did not comment on the delays. The new timetable raises concerns about the military's ability to manage the contamination crisis effectively.
