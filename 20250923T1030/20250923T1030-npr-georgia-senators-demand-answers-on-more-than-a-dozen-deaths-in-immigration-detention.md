## Article summary
Georgia's Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, are demanding answers from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem regarding the deaths of over a dozen individuals in immigration detention facilities. Since President Trump's inauguration, 15 people have died in detention, with 10 of those deaths occurring between January and June of the current year, marking the highest rate in the first six months of any year on record. The senators express concern about the treatment of detainees, emphasizing that the American public does not condone abuse. The Homeland Security Department is expanding detention space and increasing arrest rates following additional congressional funding, leading to reports of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and inadequate healthcare. A previous report by Ossoff alleged human rights violations, including mistreatment of children, citizens, and pregnant women. ICE has faced criticism for using military bases and state partnerships to expand detention capacity. Concerns have also been raised about DHS's cuts to oversight divisions focused on civil rights. ICE's Acting Director Todd Lyons assured transparency in investigations and reporting of deaths in custody during a Congressional hearing. The senators' letter highlights delays in reporting detainee deaths, which they claim hinder oversight and leave families uninformed. ICE's guidelines require reporting detainee deaths within 48 hours, but recent incidents show delays in public announcements.
