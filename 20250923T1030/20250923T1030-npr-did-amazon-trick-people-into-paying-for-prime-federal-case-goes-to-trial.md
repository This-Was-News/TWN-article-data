## Article summary
Amazon and the U.S. government are in a Seattle courtroom over allegations that Amazon tricked people into paying for Prime memberships that were difficult to cancel. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accuses Amazon of violating consumer-protection and competition laws, while Amazon denies any wrongdoing. The trial, which began with oral arguments, will last nearly a month and is one of the biggest federal cases against a major company. The FTC alleges that Amazon used 'dark patterns'—manipulative design elements—to trick users into signing up for Prime unintentionally. For example, a prominent 'Get FREE Two-Day Shipping' button made it easy to sign up, while canceling required a complex, multi-step process. Amazon argues that its designs are clear and that occasional customer misunderstandings do not prove wrongdoing. The FTC also accuses Amazon of hiding incriminating evidence, which the judge deemed bad faith. This case is a prelude to a broader FTC lawsuit accusing Amazon of functioning as a monopoly, set for trial in 2027. The FTC's investigation began during the Trump administration but was filed under Lina Khan's leadership.
