## Article summary
Ise Jingu, Japan's most revered Shinto shrine, is completely torn down and rebuilt every 20 years in a process called Shikinen Sengu, which has continued for 1,300 years. The last rebuild was completed in 2013, and the current process began this year, with over 30 ceremonies and festivals planned. More than 10,000 cypress trees will be collected and processed for the new shrine, with the presiding deity transferred in a ceremony set for 2033. The process involves various rituals, including Yamaguchisai, Konomotosai, and Misomahajimesai. Woodcutters fell sacred cypress trees, and the timbers are transported in processions. The shrine complex includes the inner sanctuary (Naiku) and the outer sanctuary (Geku). Local celebrations and traditional dances are part of the ceremonies. The process is documented by journalists and involves the participation of Shinto priests and officials. The shrine's reconstruction is a significant cultural and religious event in Japan.
