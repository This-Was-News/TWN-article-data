## Article summary
Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, will return to the air on Tuesday, as confirmed by Disney. The show was temporarily pulled last Wednesday following backlash over Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's assassination, which were criticized by Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr. Disney cited concerns over the timing and sensitivity of Kimmel's remarks. The suspension led to widespread outrage, with hundreds of entertainers, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Pedro Pascal, Selena Gomez, and Olivia Rodrigo, signing an open letter condemning Disney's decision. The letter emphasized the importance of free speech and the dangers of censorship. After discussions with Kimmel, Disney decided to resume production of the show. The suspension had initially been prompted by threats from Carr and the swift action of Nexstar, which owns multiple TV stations and was seeking FCC approval for a merger. Disney's initial statement explained that the suspension was intended to avoid further inflaming tensions during an emotional time for the country.
