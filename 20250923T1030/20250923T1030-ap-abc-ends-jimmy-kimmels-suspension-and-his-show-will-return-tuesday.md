## Article summary
ABC has decided to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, after suspending him indefinitely following controversial comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The network stated that after thoughtful conversations with Kimmel, they decided to bring the show back on Tuesday. Kimmel's comments sparked backlash, leading to some ABC affiliates, like Nexstar and Sinclair, pulling the show from their stations. While some comedians defended Kimmel, others, including President Donald Trump, criticized him. The suspension occurred amid broader tensions between the Trump administration and media outlets, with Trump pursuing legal actions and funding cuts against various news organizations. The FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, had criticized Kimmel's remarks but denied threatening ABC's licenses. The incident highlighted the complex business interests and regulatory approvals that media companies navigate. Meanwhile, hundreds of Hollywood stars signed an ACLU letter defending free speech, and ABC's The View condemned Disney's decision to suspend Kimmel. New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani also announced he would appear on a local ABC station's town hall, reversing his earlier cancellation due to Kimmel's suspension.
