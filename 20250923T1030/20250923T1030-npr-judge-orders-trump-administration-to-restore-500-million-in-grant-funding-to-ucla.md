## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Judge Rita Lin granted a preliminary injunction, stating the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by not providing specific details for the funding cuts. The administration had suspended $584 million in grants over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. Earlier, $81 million in grants from the National Science Foundation were restored after a similar ruling. The Trump administration has been using federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges, investigating diversity efforts and accusing them of liberalism and antisemitism. Two Ivy League schools, Columbia and Brown, reached deals to preserve their funding. Harvard successfully sued over funding cuts, with a judge ruling the freeze was illegal retaliation. The administration proposed a $1 billion settlement with UCLA, which Governor Gavin Newsom called extortion. The restored grants include medical research on Parkinson's disease, cancer recovery, and nerve cell regeneration, which UCLA argues are crucial for public health.
