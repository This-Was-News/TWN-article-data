## Article summary
A special tribunal in Bangladesh has sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death for crimes against humanity. The charges stem from her crackdown on a student uprising last year, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and led to the downfall of her 15-year rule. Former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan also received a death sentence for his role in the use of deadly force against protesters. Both Hasina and Khan were sentenced in absentia as they had fled to India. The tribunal accused them over the killing of hundreds during the July-August 2024 student uprising, with estimates of fatalities ranging from over 800 to potentially 1,400. Hasina has denied the charges, stating she acted in good faith to minimize loss of life and calling the verdict biased and politically motivated. The sentencing occurs amidst ongoing instability in Bangladesh, with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus heading an interim government that vowed to punish Hasina and ban her Awami League party. The interim government plans to hold elections in February, excluding Hasina's party. Security was heightened across the country ahead of the verdict, and Hasina's party called for a nationwide protest. Hasina cannot appeal the verdict unless she surrenders or is arrested within 30 days.
