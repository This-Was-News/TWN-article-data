## Article summary
The Defense Department is withdrawing hundreds of federalized National Guard troops from Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois, due to ongoing court battles that have stalled their deployments. Approximately 200 California National Guard members in Oregon and 200 Texas National Guard members in Illinois will return to their home states. This decision comes after weeks of legal challenges and may also be influenced by the holiday season. While out-of-state troops are leaving, some National Guard personnel will remain activated in both cities. About 300 Illinois National Guard personnel will continue their service in Chicago, and the number of Oregon National Guard forces in Portland will be reduced from 200 to 100. President Trump has increased the use of the National Guard over the past six months, citing the need to address crime, manage protests, and protect federal facilities. However, local and state officials in Oregon and Illinois have criticized these deployments, deeming them unnecessary and an overreach of presidential authority. Courts have consistently ruled against troop deployments in the streets of Chicago and Portland, leading to these withdrawals. A federal judge in Oregon permanently blocked troop deployments to Portland, a decision the Trump administration has appealed. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing an emergency appeal regarding troop deployments in Chicago.
