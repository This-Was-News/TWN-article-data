## Article summary
A powerful atmospheric river has largely passed through California, leaving behind a trail of destruction and at least six fatalities. Lingering thunderstorms now pose a risk of mudslides in wildfire-ravaged areas of Los Angeles County. Flood advisories are in effect for LA, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties due to recent heavy rainfall. Authorities are still searching for a 5-year-old girl swept into the ocean, whose father died trying to save her. In Sutter County, a man perished when his vehicle was swept from a flooded bridge. Off the coast of San Diego, a boat carrying migrants capsized, resulting in at least four deaths. The atmospheric river brought widespread rain to Southern California and significant snowfall in the Sierra Nevada. Scattered rain is expected to continue through Tuesday, with another storm anticipated by Thursday. The National Weather Service warns that less rainfall will be needed to trigger flooding and rockslides due to the saturated conditions.
