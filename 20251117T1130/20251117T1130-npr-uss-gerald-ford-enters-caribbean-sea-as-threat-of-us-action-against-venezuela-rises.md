## Article summary
The world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, has entered the Caribbean Sea, signaling a potential escalation of U.S. military action against Venezuela. The carrier, accompanied by thousands of service members, is part of "Operation Southern Spear," described by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as a mission to defend the homeland, remove narco-terrorists, and secure the U.S. from drug trafficking. A U.S. military official indicated that preparations are underway for possible military action, with "high-level meetings" occurring among officials and lawmakers. While President Trump has suggested he has made a decision regarding military force, it remains unclear if he will proceed. The U.S. has previously conducted strikes on boats suspected of drug trafficking from Venezuela and offered a $50 million reward for the arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. Some officials believe the deployment of the USS Gerald Ford might be a pressure tactic rather than an imminent attack. This increased activity follows the resignation of Admiral Alvin Holsey, who reportedly objected to the boat strikes that have resulted in casualties and targeted vessels that did not appear hostile.
