## Article summary
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly criticized President Trump's policies, stating they are not "America first" positions. This comes after Trump revoked his endorsement of Greene, calling her "Wacky" and a "traitor." Greene expressed concern that Trump's words could "put my life in danger." The rift between the two figures raises questions about Trump's influence within the Republican Party. Greene specifically criticized Trump's stance on the H-1B visa program and his frequent international travel, suggesting Air Force One should "stay home." Despite this public disagreement, local GOP leadership in Georgia's 14th Congressional District have reaffirmed their support for Greene. Greene suggested the public dispute is linked to the ongoing release of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Meanwhile, Representative Thomas Massie warned fellow Republicans that voting against the release of these documents could harm their political futures, regardless of Trump's short-term reactions.
