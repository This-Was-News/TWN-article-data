## Article summary
President Donald Trump has reversed his stance and now says House Republicans should vote to release files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This shift comes after significant opposition within his own party to his previous stance against releasing the files. Trump stated on social media that "We have nothing to hide" and accused Democrats of perpetuating a "Hoax" to distract from Republican successes. This reversal is seen as an acknowledgment that supporters of the bill have enough votes to pass it in the House, though its future in the Senate remains uncertain. The bill aims to compel the Justice Department to release all files and communications pertaining to Epstein and the investigation into his death, with provisions for redacting victim information or ongoing investigations. Lawmakers supporting the bill, like Rep. Thomas Massie, predict a strong showing of Republican votes, potentially even a veto-proof majority. A discharge petition, a rare tool to force a vote bypassing leadership, was introduced by Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna. The process has been contentious, with House leadership accused of delaying tactics. The vote occurs amidst new document releases, including an email suggesting Trump knew about Epstein's associates. While Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing, his past association with Epstein is documented. The situation has also highlighted a split within the Republican party, particularly between Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been a vocal supporter of releasing the files. Greene expressed confusion over Trump's strong opposition, questioning why the issue is being fought so intensely. Even if the bill passes the House, its passage in the Senate is not guaranteed, though proponents hope for significant House support to build pressure.
