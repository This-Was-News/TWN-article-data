## Article summary
President Trump has called on House Republicans to vote for the release of the Epstein files, stating "we have nothing to hide." He characterized the issue as a "Democrat Hoax" aimed at distracting from Republican successes. Trump also mentioned a new Justice Department investigation into Democrats who were aware of the convicted sex offender, reportedly at his request. This statement comes after facing pressure from within his own party regarding a campaign promise to release these files. The administration has already provided thousands of private files to the House Oversight Committee, but the Justice Department still holds unreleased documents, including witness interviews. Some House members, including Republicans, have initiated a vote to release unclassified government files, which is anticipated on Tuesday. The potential for the Senate to address the issue remains uncertain, as does whether Trump would ultimately approve the release if it passes both chambers.
