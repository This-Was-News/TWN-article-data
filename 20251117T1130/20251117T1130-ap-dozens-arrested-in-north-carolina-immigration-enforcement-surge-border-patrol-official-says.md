## Article summary
A top Border Patrol commander announced dozens of arrests in Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of an immigration enforcement surge. The operation, dubbed "Operation Charlottes Web," targeted the city due to its "sanctuary policies." Federal agents reportedly made over 80 arrests, with some residents reporting encounters near churches and apartment complexes. One U.S. citizen claimed he was thrown to the ground and briefly detained. Local community groups expressed fear, with some reporting significant cancellations of appointments due to apprehension. The Trump administration defended the surge, citing public safety threats and the need to combat crime, despite objections from local leaders and declining crime rates. Previous operations led by the same commander in Chicago and Los Angeles faced lawsuits and accusations of aggressive tactics. Mecklenburg County does not cooperate with immigration enforcement, a policy DHS claims puts the public at risk. The enforcement surge has raised concerns among residents about the tactics used and the potential impact on the community.
