## Article summary
The number of Palestinians dying in Israeli custody has dramatically increased, with nearly 100 deaths reported since the start of the war in Gaza. A report by Physicians for Human Rights-Israel indicates that systematic violence and a lack of medical care are significant contributing factors to these fatalities. Investigations by The Associated Press corroborate these findings, including interviews with former guards, medical staff, and detainees who describe routine beatings, severe mistreatment, and denial of medical attention. One former guard at the Sde Teiman military prison described the facility as a "graveyard" due to the high number of prisoner deaths and recounted instances of routine beatings and prisoners being left to die. Medical staff also reported severe wounds from restraints and a general atmosphere of abuse. The report highlights that fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the decade prior to the war, contrasting sharply with the current figures. Despite some improvements following pressure from rights groups and a Supreme Court order for better food, concerns about ongoing mistreatment and inadequate investigations persist. The Israeli Prison Service maintains it operates within the law, while the army states that allegations of abuse are assessed and that those who violate conduct codes are punished. However, lawyers for prisoners argue that accountability for alleged violence is rare, fueling the problem.
