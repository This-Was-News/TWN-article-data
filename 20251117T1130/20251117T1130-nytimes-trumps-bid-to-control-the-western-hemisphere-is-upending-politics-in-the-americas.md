## Article summary
President Trump has significantly altered decades of U.S. foreign policy by making the Western Hemisphere America's primary foreign engagement theater. This shift involves a combination of military actions, economic pressure, and diplomatic maneuvering aimed at asserting U.S. dominance in the region. Trump's administration has employed tactics such as tariffs, sanctions, and even military threats, exemplified by actions against South American boats and exploration of options against Venezuela. While stated goals include curbing drug trafficking and migration, administration officials have openly declared the overarching objective is to establish American preeminence in the Americas. This approach, which some have termed the 'Donroe Doctrine,' represents a departure from previous U.S. foreign policy in Latin America, a region historically influenced by American intervention. The strategy involves rewarding allies and punishing rivals, thereby reshaping the political landscape of the Americas.
