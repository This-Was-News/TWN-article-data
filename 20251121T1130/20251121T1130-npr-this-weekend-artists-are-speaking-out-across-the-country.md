## Article summary
Artists across more than 40 states are participating in "Fall of Freedom," a two-day event described as a creative resistance to authoritarianism. The initiative, featuring over 600 events, was organized in response to a perceived climate of fear and suppression within cultural institutions. Artists and organizers like visual artist Eric Gottesman and playwright Lynn Nottage cite actions such as grant cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts and criticism from President Trump as contributing factors to this atmosphere. Nottage notes that many large museums are hesitant to program potentially controversial work due to fear of retribution. The "Fall of Freedom" aims to provide a platform for artists to speak out when institutions feel paralyzed. Visual artist Dread Scott, who conceived the idea, emphasized the importance of collective action, stating that while individuals might be targeted, a unified front is harder to suppress. Scott highlighted art's historical role in social movements, referencing examples like Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" and Picasso's "Guernica." The event was organized rapidly to ensure responsiveness to the current moment, with planned activities ranging from zine making to performances. The name "Fall of Freedom" is interpreted by organizers as a potential decline, but also as the start of a necessary struggle towards future freedoms.
