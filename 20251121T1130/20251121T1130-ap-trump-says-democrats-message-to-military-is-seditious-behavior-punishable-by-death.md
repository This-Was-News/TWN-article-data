## Article summary
President Donald Trump has accused six Democratic lawmakers of sedition, a crime punishable by death, for releasing a video urging U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy illegal orders. The video, shared by Senator Elissa Slotkin and featuring other veterans in Congress, highlights the immense stress on service members and warns against the Trump administration pitting the military against citizens. Trump reposted the video with strong condemnation, labeling the lawmakers as "traitors" and calling for their arrest. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that while Trump wasn't calling for executions, he believed the Democrats' message inciting defiance of lawful orders was dangerous and warranted accountability. Democrats, including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, criticized Trump's rhetoric as inflammatory, while Speaker Mike Johnson suggested Trump was merely defining a crime and found the lawmakers' video inappropriate. Some allies of Trump, like Stephen Miller, echoed his sentiments, calling the video an "insurrection." Conversely, a group of national security experts argued that the lawmakers' message was a restatement of established military doctrine regarding the refusal of illegal orders. The Pentagon, through spokesperson Sean Parnell, asserted that the military follows legal orders and that the politicians were "out of their minds."
