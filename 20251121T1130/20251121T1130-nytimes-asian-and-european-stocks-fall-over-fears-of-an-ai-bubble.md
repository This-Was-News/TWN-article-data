## Article summary
Global markets experienced significant swings as anxiety over artificial intelligence spending returned, leading to sharp reversals in Asian stocks. Benchmark indexes in South Korea and Taiwan fell nearly 4 percent, with major chip companies like SK Hynix and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company seeing substantial declines. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 2 percent, impacted by steep losses in semiconductor equipment manufacturer Advantest and major AI investor SoftBank. This downturn follows recent investor concerns that the lavish spending on AI hardware by tech companies might be outpacing actual demand, contributing to a slump in large global technology firms. A brief surge in global tech stocks on Thursday, fueled by strong earnings from chipmaker Nvidia, offered temporary relief. However, this optimism was short-lived as investors regained their nervousness. In the United States, Nvidia's stock initially rose over 5 percent but ended the day down more than 3 percent, and the S&P 500 tumbled after an earlier climb. These market movements highlight how investor jitters about potential overvaluation in the AI sector are causing significant volatility in technology stocks and impacting global indexes.
