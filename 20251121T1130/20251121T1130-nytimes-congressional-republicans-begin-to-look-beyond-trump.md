## Article summary
Congressional Republicans are beginning to assert their independence from President Trump, driven by recent election defeats and the approaching 2026 election cycle. This shift is evidenced by their willingness to defy Trump on issues like the disclosure of federal files on Jeffrey Epstein, the refusal to eliminate the filibuster, and resistance to his demands for redrawing House district maps. Trump's grip on Congress appears to be weakening earlier than usual, influenced by the party's poor performance in recent off-year elections and polls indicating a weakened state for Trump and the GOP. While Trump retains significant influence due to his base's loyalty, some Republicans acknowledge an inevitable dissipation of presidential power over time. Representative Thomas Massie's successful push for the Epstein vote, despite presidential opposition, serves as a key example, demonstrating that defying Trump may not be a political death knell. The outcomes of primary elections, particularly for incumbents facing Trump-backed challengers, will be closely watched. The economic outlook and Trump's approval ratings are expected to further influence Republican willingness to follow him blindly. This evolving dynamic is already impacting legislative debates, such as the extension of healthcare subsidies, where some vulnerable Republicans prioritize voter concerns over Trump's stance. Rifts are appearing between House and Senate GOP leaders, who were previously unified in supporting Trump's agenda. Senate Republicans, in particular, have shown a greater inclination to act independently, as seen in their handling of the Epstein bill and their refusal to abolish the filibuster. Congressional Republicans are also cautiously asserting themselves on other issues, including questioning administration actions and supporting measures like Russia sanctions, while some express dismay at Trump's rhetoric. Despite these shifts, Trump continues to wield considerable power, but the long-term trend suggests a move towards a post-Trump era for the party as they focus on their own survival.
