## Article summary
The tech industry is experiencing a period of unprecedented growth, marked by historic profits, soaring stock prices, and massive deal values. Nvidia, a key player in artificial intelligence chip manufacturing, reported a nearly $32 billion quarterly profit, a significant increase from the previous year. The company recently achieved a $5 trillion valuation, joining tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon, which collectively reported over $110 billion in profits in their latest quarters. Despite this impressive financial performance, some industry insiders express concern, viewing the rapid expansion as potentially unsustainable and resembling a "house of cards." They argue that the high demand for Nvidia's chips does not necessarily translate to widespread A.I. adoption, but rather indicates companies building large-scale A.I. systems in anticipation of future use. This underlying anxiety was reflected in the stock market, where Nvidia's share price experienced a notable drop shortly after its earnings report, contributing to a broader decline in tech stocks and the overall market.
