## Article summary
President Trump has characterized a video by several Democratic lawmakers as "seditious behavior, punishable by DEATH!" The video, featuring veterans and national security professionals in Congress, stated that members of the military can and must refuse illegal orders from their superiors. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that Trump does not actually wish for members of Congress to be executed, but emphasized the importance of the military chain of command. The Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan, and Sens. Mark Kelly, Elissa Slotkin, asserted that the current administration is creating conflict between uniformed professionals and American citizens. They also warned that threats to the Constitution are present both domestically and internationally. In their video, they reiterated that no one is obligated to carry out unlawful orders and urged military and intelligence personnel not to surrender in defending the Constitution. Following Trump's reaction, the lawmakers issued a statement condemning his calls for violence and reaffirming their lifelong oath to the Constitution. House Democratic leadership has called for Trump to remove his posts and for Republicans to condemn his rhetoric, citing concerns for the safety of the members and their families.
