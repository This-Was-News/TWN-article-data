## Article summary
Amidst broader economic uncertainty, numerous companies are implementing significant layoffs, leading to increased worker anxiety. Factors contributing to these job cuts include rising operational costs, shifts in consumer spending, corporate restructuring, and a strategic redirection of funds towards artificial intelligence. Federal employees have also faced uncertainty, with thousands of federal jobs cut and a prolonged government shutdown impacting worker sentiment. Recent economic data reveals a surprising increase in job additions in September, but also a rise in unemployment and concerning gender and racial disparities in job growth. Several major companies have announced substantial layoffs, including Verizon (over 13,000 jobs), Amazon (14,000 corporate jobs), UPS (48,000 job cuts), and Nestlé (16,000 jobs globally). Other notable companies with recent layoffs include General Motors, Paramount, Target, Lufthansa Group, Novo Nordisk, ConocoPhillips, Intel, Microsoft, and Procter & Gamble. These reductions are often attributed to streamlining efforts, adapting to market changes, cost-cutting measures, and investments in new technologies like AI.
