## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his security cabinet to address a surge in Israeli settler violence in the West Bank. This meeting occurred amidst increasing pressure from the U.S. to curb the violence, which could jeopardize a U.S.-backed peace plan for Gaza. Rights groups and Palestinians contend that settler attacks are a daily occurrence, contradicting Netanyahu's characterization of the perpetrators as a "handful of extremists." The U.N. Humanitarian office reported that October saw the highest number of Israeli settler attacks since tracking began in 2006. The security cabinet meeting followed an announcement by Israel's Civil Administration to seize large parts of Sebastia, a significant archaeological site in the West Bank. Meanwhile, Israeli settlers celebrated the establishment of a new, unauthorized settlement near Bethlehem. In a separate development, Singapore announced it would impose financial sanctions and entry bans on four Israeli individuals for their alleged involvement in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Singapore's Foreign Ministry stated that these settlers have engaged in "egregious acts of extremist violence" and emphasized that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and hinder the prospects for a two-state solution. Some of the sanctioned individuals have ties to extremist figures and organizations.
