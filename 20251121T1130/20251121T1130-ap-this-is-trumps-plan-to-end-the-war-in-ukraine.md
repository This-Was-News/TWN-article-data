## Article summary
The Associated Press has obtained a 28-point draft proposal by Donald Trump aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. This plan, presented in Kyiv and reportedly developed in collaboration with Washington and Moscow, suggests Ukraine cede territory to Russia, avoid NATO membership, and limit its armed forces. Key points include Ukraine enshrining its non-NATO stance in its constitution, with NATO agreeing not to admit Ukraine. The proposal also outlines security guarantees for Ukraine, with specific conditions for the U.S. to provide compensation and a decisive response to any Russian invasion. It suggests European fighter jets be stationed in Poland and includes provisions for rebuilding Ukraine with significant investment from frozen Russian assets. Russia would be reintegrated into the global economy, with sanctions lifted in stages, and invited to rejoin the G8. The plan designates Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as de facto Russian, while Kherson and Zaporizhzhia would be frozen along the line of contact. Other territories controlled by Russia would be relinquished, and a demilitarized buffer zone would be established. The proposal also addresses prisoner exchanges, humanitarian aid, and the holding of elections in Ukraine within 100 days. A Peace Council, headed by Donald Trump, would monitor and guarantee the agreement, with sanctions for violations. The agreement would be legally binding, and a ceasefire would take effect immediately upon implementation.
