## Article summary
The U.S. government is compelled by recently signed legislation to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein before Christmas. This action follows months of congressional debate and public demand for transparency. While thousands of pages are expected, much Epstein-related information has already been made public through litigation and previous disclosures. The Justice Department has stated that a rumored client list of famous associates does not exist. The files will include records from various investigations, FBI notes, witness interview transcripts, and potentially Epstein's autopsy report. However, information containing victims' personally identifiable details or depicting sexual abuse will be withheld or redacted. The law explicitly prohibits withholding records solely to prevent embarrassment to public figures. The files will be released in a searchable and downloadable format, though the Justice Department may withhold materials that could jeopardize active federal investigations. This release is occurring after President Trump's administration previously halted the release of further documents, prompting Congress to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Many records, including flight logs and address books, have already been made public through civil lawsuits and Freedom of Information Act requests.
