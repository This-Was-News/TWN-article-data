## Article summary
King Charles III is stripping his brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicting him from his royal residence, Buckingham Palace announced. Andrew will no longer be known as a prince and will move from the Royal Lodge into private accommodation. He will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. This action follows revelations about Prince Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Pressure had been mounting for the prince's removal from the Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title Duke of York earlier this month. This was due to his friendship with Epstein and allegations by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein's victims. The king's decision goes further by stripping Andrew of the title of prince, which he has held since birth. The palace stated these censures are necessary despite Prince Andrew's continued denial of the allegations. Their Majesties expressed their utmost sympathies to victims and survivors of abuse.
