## Article summary
In a recent meeting in South Korea, President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China reached a truce on tariffs and rare earth elements, largely reverting to previous terms. The United States agreed to pause a new rule that would restrict trade with Chinese companies posing a national security threat for one year. This move is significant as it marks one of the first times the U.S. has considered national security-related technology controls as a point of negotiation in trade talks. Previously, the U.S. maintained that export controls were a national security matter not open for trade discussions. China has consistently sought to negotiate the rollback of these export control measures. The agreement also includes the U.S. reversing some tariffs and pausing new fees on Chinese ships, while China will suspend its rare earths restrictions and resume buying U.S. soybeans. Additionally, China promised to crack down on fentanyl precursor chemicals. Analysts view the U.S. concession on national security controls as a major victory for China.
