## Article summary
President Trump announced his intention to order the U.S. military to resume nuclear testing, a move that evokes the intense nuclear arms race of the Cold War era. This declaration has reignited debate within the national security community regarding the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which, though agreed upon in the mid-1990s, never formally entered into force due to insufficient ratifications. Trump stated his decision was prompted by the nuclear testing activities of other nations. However, the U.S. has not conducted an explosive nuclear weapon test since 1992. While North Korea has tested, its last explosive test was in September 2017. Russia has not conducted such a test in 35 years. It is suggested that Trump may be conflating nuclear weapons tests with Russia's recent declarations about testing advanced delivery vehicles, such as a nuclear-powered cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo. These new Russian weapons are designed to circumvent existing American missile defense systems. The call to resume testing challenges the established norm of observing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, with some former aides arguing it hinders the U.S. ability to project strength.
