## Article summary
A federal judge sentenced Taylor Taranto to time served for making a hoax threat near former President Barack Obama's home. Taranto, who spent 22 months in jail, was accused of suggesting his van was rigged with explosives, though none were found. Firearms and a machete were recovered. Judge Carl Nichols noted Taranto's lack of criminal history, partly due to the Justice Department dismissing charges related to his participation in the January 6, 2021 Capitol siege. President Trump had previously granted clemency to Taranto. The Justice Department recently sidelined two prosecutors who worked on Taranto's case, withdrawing their original sentencing memo which referenced the Capitol riot and Taranto's movement towards Obama's home. A replacement memo removed these references. Judge Nichols expressed intent to unseal the original memo and praised the sidelined prosecutors for their professional work. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro declined to comment on personnel decisions but affirmed the department's commitment to pursuing justice against those who threaten violence. Taranto, a Navy veteran, has returned home and faces supervised release, mental health assessment, and restrictions on firearms and controlled substances. His attorney argued his actions were not violent, and Taranto himself spoke of "election fraud for the 2020 election" before signaling an appeal.
