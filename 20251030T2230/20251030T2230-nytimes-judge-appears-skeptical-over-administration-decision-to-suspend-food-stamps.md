## Article summary
A federal judge expressed skepticism regarding the Trump administration's decision to halt food stamp payments during a government shutdown. The administration argued it lacked the legal authority to use available funds, including emergency reserves, to provide benefits to millions of Americans in November. Roughly two dozen states filed a lawsuit to prevent people from going hungry due to this budgetary dispute. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) serves about 42 million people, and benefits were set to cease by November 1st. Despite having billions in reserve funds, the administration cited legal and technical obstacles to accessing them. Judge Indira Talwani questioned why emergency reserves couldn't be used in such a crisis. The administration's stance contrasted with its actions in reallocating funds for other government functions. SNAP, a program targeted for cuts by Republicans, faces interruption while other programs like WIC were previously funded. The administration also opposed using a large fund for nutrition programs, claiming it would impact child nutrition. States are seeking a court order to compel the federal government to pay SNAP benefits as scheduled, highlighting the potential for widespread hunger and financial hardship.
