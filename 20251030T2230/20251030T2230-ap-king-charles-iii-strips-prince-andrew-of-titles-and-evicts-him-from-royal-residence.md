## Article summary
King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his remaining royal titles and evicted him from his royal residence, the Royal Lodge. This unprecedented move follows mounting pressure over his association with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and renewed sexual abuse allegations. Prince Andrew will no longer be known as a prince and will have to vacate his mansion. Buckingham Palace stated these censures are necessary despite Andrew's denial of the allegations, emphasizing sympathy for abuse victims. This is the most significant royal departure since King Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. Andrew's brother, Prince Harry, however, retains his princely title despite renouncing royal duties. The decision comes after new revelations about Andrew's continued contact with Epstein and the publication of Virginia Giuffre's memoir detailing alleged sexual encounters. Andrew previously settled a civil suit with Giuffre out of court. He is expected to move to a property on the Sandringham estate and receive private financial support from the King.
