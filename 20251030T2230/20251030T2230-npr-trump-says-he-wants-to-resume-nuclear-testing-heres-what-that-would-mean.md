## Article summary
President Trump announced that the U.S. would resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in decades, citing that other nations are testing. Experts warn this move would be dangerous and could destabilize the global balance of power. The Nevada National Security Site is the only location in the U.S. capable of conducting such tests, likely through underground mineshafts. While underground testing is safer than atmospheric tests, it still carries risks, including potential radioactive leaks and seismic activity that could damage structures in nearby Las Vegas. The U.S., Russia, and China voluntarily halted nuclear testing after the Cold War, with the U.S. conducting its last test in 1992. Currently, the U.S. relies on scientific experiments and simulations to maintain its nuclear arsenal. Some scientists believe testing is unnecessary, while others acknowledge potential future reasons for it given the current geopolitical climate. Russia has recently announced successful tests of a nuclear-powered cruise missile and an underwater drone, which are seen as provocative actions. This escalation mirrors the dynamics of the Cold War and could signal the start of a new arms race. Resuming nuclear testing would be costly, with estimates around $140 million per test, and experts suggest other nations have more to gain from such a resumption than the United States.
