## Article summary
A federal court decision is expected soon regarding the potential cutoff of SNAP benefits for 42 million Americans due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. The Trump administration claims it cannot continue SNAP payments because the federal government has been shut down for nearly a month, stating "the well has run dry." However, Democratic governors and attorneys general from numerous states have sued the federal government to ensure benefit payments continue. They argue that SNAP is an entitlement and cutting it off would cause irreparable harm to millions of Americans and the states. During a hearing, Judge Indira Talwani expressed skepticism about the administration's argument, questioning why a USDA emergency fund could not be used. She suggested that Congress intended for such funds to protect Americans during emergencies like a government shutdown. Despite potential use of the emergency fund, officials estimate it falls short of the full amount needed for November's benefits. This shortfall could lead to delays and reduced payments for millions, even if the fund is tapped.
