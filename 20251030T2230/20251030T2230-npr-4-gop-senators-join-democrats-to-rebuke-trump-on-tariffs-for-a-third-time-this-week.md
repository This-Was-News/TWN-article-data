## Article summary
In a series of three votes, a slim majority of the GOP-led Senate has rebuked President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs on Canada, Brazil, and other countries. The latest vote on Thursday saw four Republicans join Democrats to roll back global tariffs announced in April, passing with a 51-47 margin. Senator Tim Kaine criticized Trump's tariff strategy as chaotic, involving broad announcements followed by potential suspensions for one-on-one deals. Earlier in the week, similar resolutions to terminate tariffs on Brazil and Canada also passed with bipartisan support. Despite these votes, the measures are unlikely to become law due to House rules and a probable presidential veto. However, the votes highlight growing unease within the Republican party regarding the economic impact of Trump's tariff policies, particularly on the farming and manufacturing sectors. This development comes ahead of Supreme Court arguments challenging Trump's authority to implement tariffs using emergency powers. The four Republican senators who broke ranks did so despite lobbying efforts from Vice President JD Vance. Senator Thom Tillis specifically cited a lack of rational basis for the Brazil tariffs, which were imposed to pressure Brazil's government over its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro.
