## Article summary
President Donald Trump has invited the families of two National Guard members, Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe, who were shot in Washington D.C., to the White House. Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died from her injuries, while Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition. Both soldiers were deployed as part of a crime-fighting initiative that federalized the D.C. police force. Vigils have been held in West Virginia to honor the fallen soldier, with her principal remembering her as a kind and helpful student. The alleged shooter, a 29-year-old Afghan national, faces murder and assault charges. This incident led the Trump administration to halt asylum decisions and pause visa issuances for individuals traveling on Afghan passports. Governor Patrick Morrisey and Attorney General Pam Bondi have also expressed their condolences and visited the families. The community mourns Beckstrom, a "favorite daughter of Webster County," and hopes for Wolfe's recovery. Wolfe joined the service in 2019, and Beckstrom enlisted in June 2023, serving as a military police officer.
