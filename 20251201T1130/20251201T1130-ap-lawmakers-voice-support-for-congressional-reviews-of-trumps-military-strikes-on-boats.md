## Article summary
Lawmakers from both parties have expressed support for congressional reviews of U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of drug smuggling, following a report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order to kill all crew members during a Sept. 2 attack. While some Republicans expressed skepticism about the report's accuracy, concerns were raised about the legality of attacking survivors, with Senator Tim Kaine suggesting it could constitute a war crime if true. Representative Mike Turner confirmed that congressional committees have opened investigations into the matter, emphasizing the seriousness of such an act if it occurred. President Donald Trump confirmed speaking with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, amidst an escalating campaign against drug trafficking. Trump stated he would not have wanted a second strike and defended Hegseth, who denied ordering the deaths. Senate and House Armed Services Committees have pledged vigorous oversight to ascertain the facts surrounding these operations. Other lawmakers, like Representative Don Bacon, urged a thorough investigation to uncover the truth, expressing doubt that Hegseth would authorize an illegal act. The administration's actions, including a potential closure of Venezuelan airspace, have drawn criticism from Maduro's government.
