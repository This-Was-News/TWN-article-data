## Article summary
The Venezuelan government has denounced President Trump's recent call to close the airspace above Venezuela, labeling it a "colonialist threat" that violates international law and infringes upon the nation's sovereignty. Trump's statement, made via Truth Social, declared the airspace closed to all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers. Venezuela asserts that no external authority has the right to control or block its international airspace, citing the UN Charter's prohibition of the use of force. This declaration follows "Operation Southern Spear," a U.S. military campaign involving at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats, resulting in numerous fatalities. Congressional committees from both parties are scrutinizing the Pentagon's actions, with Democrats raising concerns about the evidence used for the strikes and potential war crimes. Some lawmakers argue that Trump's actions are reckless and could lead to a costly foreign conflict, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war. Despite Trump's announcement, flights are reportedly continuing in Venezuelan airspace.
