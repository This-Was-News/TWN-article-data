## Article summary
Law enforcement is investigating a shooting incident involving National Guard members in Washington, D.C., which has coincided with significant changes in U.S. immigration policy. President Trump has spoken with the families of the National Guard members affected and invited them to the White House. In response to the incident, D.C. police are increasing security measures, ensuring that every National Guard patrol group in the city will be accompanied by at least one D.C. police officer. The National Guard member who died, Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, both from West Virginia, had volunteered for the mission in D.C. Wolfe remains in critical condition. The suspect, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who immigrated to the U.S. in 2021, is now facing a first-degree murder charge. Lakanwal previously worked with a CIA-operated elite counterterrorism unit. Officials are still seeking a definitive motive for the shooting. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has announced a halt to all asylum decisions, with USCIS Director Joseph Edlow stating that the agency will not resume processing until all aliens can be vetted to the maximum extent possible. President Trump also indicated an intention to permanently pause migration from all "Third World Countries."
