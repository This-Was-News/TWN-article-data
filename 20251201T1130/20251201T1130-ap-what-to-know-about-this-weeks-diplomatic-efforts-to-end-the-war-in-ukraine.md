## Article summary
Diplomatic efforts are underway to end the war in Ukraine, with a U.S.-led initiative gaining momentum and Ukrainian officials meeting with U.S. counterparts. A revised peace plan, initially proposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, has been met with cautious optimism from both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, though significant hurdles remain. Key sticking points include the potential cession of Ukrainian territory to Russia and ensuring Ukraine's future security, with Russia maintaining maximalist demands and continuing military actions. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksandr Bevz indicated President Zelenskyy wishes to discuss the territorial issue directly with Trump, while former negotiator Andrii Yermak stated Zelenskyy would not cede land. Ukraine also insists on NATO membership as a security guarantee, a point Trump has opposed. Meanwhile, Yermak resigned amid a corruption scandal, impacting Ukraine's negotiating team. Putin has expressed confidence in achieving his goals through prolonged conflict if necessary. European nations are also engaged in discussions regarding military support for Ukraine and the use of frozen Russian assets. Despite diplomatic overtures, the deep divisions between Kyiv and Moscow suggest a lengthy path to peace.
