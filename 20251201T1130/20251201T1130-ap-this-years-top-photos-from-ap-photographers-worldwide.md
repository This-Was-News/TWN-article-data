## Article summary
The Associated Press's 2025 photojournalism captures a year of intense global events, from the quiet contemplation of nature to the chaos of conflict and migration. Photographers documented the struggles of Venezuelan migrants giving up on reaching the U.S. amid crackdowns, and the plight of those fleeing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Images from Gaza depict the devastation of homes and the struggle for survival, including heartbreaking scenes of loss and malnutrition. The year also saw moments of cultural expression, like punk rock festivals in China and religious gatherings in India, alongside the intense moments of the Iran-Israel conflict, with images of missile attacks and people taking shelter. The collection highlights the human element in major news stories, from protests in Argentina and Chile to the aftermath of natural disasters like wildfires in Greece and hurricanes in Jamaica. It also touches on political events, including protests against Venezuelan leadership and U.S. immigration policies. The AP photographers, described as journalists, explorers, artists, and understanders, used their skills in vantage point, light, and storytelling to capture these moments. The gallery emphasizes the power of photography to create lasting collective memory, preserving glimpses of a complex world filled with both hardship and resilience.
