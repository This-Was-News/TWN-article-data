## Article summary
The Independent Center is an organization aiming to disrupt the two-party system in the U.S. Congress by electing independent candidates. They are leveraging artificial intelligence to identify Congressional districts where independent candidates have a viable chance of winning against either Democratic or Republican nominees. Their goal is to elect at least a handful of independents in the 2026 elections, which could prevent either major party from securing a majority in the House of Representatives. This effort is fueled by data indicating a rise in Americans identifying as independent voters. The organization uses AI to analyze real-time voter sentiment, identify districts with low turnout or a significant independent plurality, and even to find potential candidates by analyzing their online footprints. They acknowledge the criticism of independent candidates acting as 'spoilers' but embrace this role, viewing it as a way to challenge a flawed and entrenched political system. The Independent Center's team comprises experienced political strategists and data analysts focused on game theory and voter sentiment. They believe that a growing segment of the electorate is disillusioned with the binary choices offered by the two major parties, creating an opportune moment for independent voices.
