## Article summary
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has announced significant upcoming changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aiming to "deconstruct" the program. Rollins claims her agency has uncovered "massive fraud" based on state-provided data, citing statistics about deceased individuals and double payments. However, these statistics lack transparency, and food policy experts express concern that Rollins' narrative distorts the reality of SNAP fraud. The proposed changes follow recent legislation that already introduced deep cuts to the program. Rollins' suggestion of a new reapplication process for all SNAP recipients caused confusion, but the USDA now indicates it will use existing recertification protocols. A draft regulation suggests a potential change to "broad-based categorical eligibility," which experts estimate could cause millions to lose benefits. Critics argue the administration is attacking anti-hunger programs, while proponents believe these changes will protect taxpayers and ensure benefits go to those most in need.
