## Article summary
President Donald Trump is now openly embracing Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for overhauling the federal government, which he previously distanced himself from during the 2024 campaign. Trump announced he would meet with Russ Vought, a key figure in Project 2025, to discuss cutting Democratic agencies. This marks a significant shift from Trump's earlier denouncements of the project, which was criticized by his Democratic rivals, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Despite Trump's past claims of ignorance about Project 2025, he has since appointed several of its authors to his administration. The project includes proposals to expand presidential power and reduce the federal workforce, which Trump is now pursuing. The government shutdown is being used to accelerate these goals, including mass firings of federal workers and targeting Democratic projects. Vought aims to centralize power in the presidency, with the Office of Management and Budget playing a crucial role. Republicans like Sen. Mike Lee and House Speaker Mike Johnson support these efforts, while Democrats criticize the concentration of power and the shutdown's impact.
