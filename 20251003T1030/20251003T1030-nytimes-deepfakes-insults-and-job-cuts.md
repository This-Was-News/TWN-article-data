## Article summary
President Trump has escalated attacks on Democrats during a government shutdown, using insults, mockery, and deepfake videos to target political adversaries. He has threatened to cut funding for agencies in Democratic-led states, including terminating over $7.5 billion in awards. The shutdown has led to mass layoffs and service cuts, with Trump using the opportunity to make lasting changes to the federal bureaucracy. Historically, government shutdowns have been contentious, but Trump's tactics are deemed unprecedented. Comparisons are drawn to the 1995 shutdown between President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich, which was triggered by a personal snub. Gingrich admits the shutdown was partly due to a perceived slight, while Trump's actions are seen as more aggressive and retaliatory. Experts note that Trump's strategy is more about power and retribution than policy. The current shutdown's dynamics differ from past ones, with Trump leveraging modern public platforms and having allies within the government planning to shrink its size. The political climate today is marked by hostility and vitriol, contrasting with the cooperative aspects of past shutdowns. Trump's approach may differ from his first term, where he eventually conceded on the border wall issue.
