## Article summary
Duke University, known for its relatively conservative stance, has been targeted by the Trump administration despite its low-profile approach to diversity programs. The administration accused Duke of using discriminatory criteria in its student-run law journal and alleged racial discrimination in its health system without specific evidence. This move reflects the administration's broadening focus from antisemitism to diversity measures in higher education. Duke's situation highlights the confusion and fear spread by the administration's selective targeting of elite institutions. While some institutions face funding cuts, others are offered preferential treatment in exchange for compliance with certain demands. The administration's actions have created an uncertain environment in higher education, with institutions navigating between avoiding conflict and adhering to federal expectations.
