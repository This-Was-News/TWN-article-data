## Article summary
Sean Combs is set to be sentenced in federal court in New York on Friday for his conviction on prostitution-related charges. The trial, which lasted several weeks, resulted in a split verdict, with Combs found guilty of transporting two women across state lines for commercial sex but acquitted of more serious charges like sex trafficking and racketeering. Prosecutors are seeking over a decade in prison, while Combs' attorneys argue for a sentence of no more than 14 months, considering the time he has already served. The case involved graphic testimony and evidence, including a hotel security video showing Combs assaulting one of the women. Victims and former employees submitted impact statements, detailing the trauma and abuse they endured. Combs plans to address the court during sentencing, aiming to mitigate his sentence. The trial highlighted a history of violence and control over his partners and employees, with defense attorneys admitting to domestic violence but arguing it did not constitute trafficking or racketeering. Despite the defense's efforts to discredit witnesses, the prosecution's case was substantial, leading to the conviction on two counts. The sentencing hearing will determine the final outcome of this high-profile case.
