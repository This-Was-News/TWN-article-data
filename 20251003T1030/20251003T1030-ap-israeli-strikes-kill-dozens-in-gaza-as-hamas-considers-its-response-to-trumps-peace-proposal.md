## Article summary
Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 57 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, as Hamas considers its response to U.S. President Donald Trump's peace proposal. The plan requires Hamas to return all hostages, give up power, and disarm in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and an end to fighting, but it does not promise Palestinian statehood. Many Palestinians believe the plan favors Israel, and Hamas officials have stated that some elements are unacceptable. Key mediators Qatar and Egypt have called for further negotiations. The strikes occurred in various locations, including a humanitarian aid distribution area and a hospital. Doctors Without Borders reported the death of one of its staff members. In Gaza City, hospitals are struggling to reach patients due to a major Israeli offensive. Israel has intercepted most vessels in a flotilla attempting to break the blockade of Gaza. Meanwhile, a Palestinian militant was killed in the West Bank after an attack on an Israeli checkpoint. The war, triggered by a Hamas attack in October 2023, has resulted in over 66,200 Palestinian deaths and 170,000 injuries, with around 400,000 Palestinians fleeing famine-stricken Gaza City.
