## Article summary
Robert Preston Morris, the founder of Gateway Church in Texas, pleaded guilty to five counts of lewd and indecent acts with a child. The abuse occurred between 1982 and 1986 when the victim was 12 years old. Morris, who was a traveling evangelist at the time, stayed with the victim's family in Hominy, Oklahoma. He led one of the nation's largest megachurches until his resignation last year. Under a plea agreement, Morris received a 10-year suspended sentence with the first six months to be served in jail. The victim, Cindy Clemishire, expressed hope that her story would help other victims come forward. Morris must register as a sex offender and pay restitution to the victim. His attorney stated that Morris wanted to accept responsibility for his actions. Morris had previously admitted to inappropriate sexual behavior but denied intercourse. Gateway Church, founded by Morris in 2000, declined to comment on the case. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond emphasized the importance of holding those who prey on children accountable.
