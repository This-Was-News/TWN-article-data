## Article summary
The FDA has approved a generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, developed by Evita Solutions, which is set to launch in January 2026. This approval has sparked criticism from anti-abortion groups and politicians, including Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who questioned the FDA's leadership. The FDA stated that it has limited discretion in approving generic drugs and does not endorse any product. The approval comes amid pressure from abortion opponents for a review of mifepristone's safety, which has been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists. The FDA's decision-making process has faced political intervention under the current administration, which has delayed decisions on vaccines. Mifepristone was first approved in 2000, with access gradually expanding over time. The FDA's approval process for generic drugs is typically routine, with multiple versions approved after the original patent expires. Evita Solutions aims to provide affordable and accessible abortion care. Access to mifepristone is restricted in many states due to laws banning or limiting abortion, despite opposition from major medical societies.
