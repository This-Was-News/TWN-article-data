## Article summary
One of the two men killed in a car and knife attack on a synagogue in Manchester may have been killed by a bullet fired by police. The attacker, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, rammed a car into pedestrians and then attacked them with a knife, wearing a fake explosives belt. The attack occurred during Yom Kippur, the most solemn day in the Jewish calendar. Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack as a result of rising Jew hatred. The attacker was not previously known to authorities. Three people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism. Religious and political leaders condemned the attack and pledged to reassure the Jewish community. Antisemitic incidents in the U.K. have risen sharply since the Hamas attack on Israel. Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised to guarantee the security of British Jews. Some leaders claimed pro-Palestinian demonstrations had spread hatred of Jews, while others supported the protests for a ceasefire and end to suffering in Gaza.
