## Article summary
The Trump administration offered a select group of universities a deal: in exchange for agreeing to certain demands, such as limiting international students and protecting conservative voices, they would receive preferential treatment for federal grants. The University of Texas expressed interest in signing the compact, but others in higher education saw it as an attempt to push universities to conform to the administration's political agenda. Critics view this as a threat to university independence and an overreach of executive power. The compact includes conditions like banning consideration of race or sex in hiring and admissions, capping international undergraduate enrollment, requiring admissions examinations, and suppressing grade inflation. Universities with large endowments would also be asked to waive tuition for students interested in the hard sciences. This move has sparked outrage and concern about the government's influence on higher education.
