## Article summary
Sarah Mullally has been appointed as the first woman Archbishop of Canterbury, leading the world's 85 million Anglicans. Her appointment was announced by the Church of England and the U.K. government after her election by the College of Canons of Canterbury Cathedral and approval by King Charles III. At 63, Mullally is a former nurse and was previously the Bishop of London. She is the fourth woman to be ordained in the Church's history and sits in the House of Lords. In her 2018 opening sermon, she acknowledged her role as a subversive figure. Mullally replaces Justin Welby, who resigned in November. She will face challenges related to divisions over the treatment of women and LGBTQ people, as well as addressing sexual abuse scandals within the church.
