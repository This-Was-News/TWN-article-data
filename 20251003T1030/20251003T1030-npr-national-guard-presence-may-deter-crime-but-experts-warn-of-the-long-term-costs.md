## Article summary
The National Guard has been deployed to several cities as part of President Trump's anti-crime initiative, with their presence aimed at deterring crime. While their visible uniformed presence may have a deterrent effect, as suggested by research in the UK, their military identity and unrequested presence in cities could generate resentment. Criminologists emphasize the importance of data-driven strategies, such as focusing on crime hot spots, but it's unclear if the federal government is employing these methods. The effectiveness of the National Guard's deployment remains uncertain, with crime rates in some cities like Washington, D.C., and Memphis still above the national average. President Trump's recent comments about using dangerous cities as military training grounds have raised further questions. Despite initial short-term crime reductions in Washington, D.C., experts warn of potential long-term costs, including eroded trust between local police and communities. The fiscal reality and sustainability of such deployments are also called into question.
