## Article summary
U.S. Border Patrol shot a woman in Brighton Park, Chicago, during an immigration enforcement operation. The incident sparked protests, with about 100 people gathering and clashing with federal agents using pepper balls and tear gas. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the woman was armed and had rammed agents' vehicles, but the account has not been independently verified. The woman drove herself to the hospital and was in fair condition. Chicago police were called to the scene but were not involved in the investigation. Ald. Julia Ramirez criticized federal agents for escalating tensions and antagonizing protesters. Protesters demanded the removal of ICE agents and complained about their treatment. U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros reaffirmed his office's commitment to protecting federal agents. The incident is the second shooting involving federal agents in Chicago since the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement operation began. The community expressed fear and anger over the federal presence and the use of force against protesters.
