## Article summary
The first supermoon of the year will occur on Monday night, appearing slightly larger and brighter. This phenomenon happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit, making it look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year. October's supermoon is the first of three this year, with the next ones scheduled for November and December. The difference in size and brightness can be subtle and may be hard to notice without comparing it to the regular moon. The moon will be about 224,600 miles away from Earth during this event. Supermoons are not particularly rare and can be seen by everyone worldwide without special equipment, weather permitting. The next notable astronomical events include two lunar eclipses in 2026, one total and one partial, visible across various regions. Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer at the Franklin Institute, notes that the difference in size may not be easily discernible without a reference point. The supermoon's brightness and size can vary slightly depending on its position in the sky. This natural spectacle offers a unique opportunity for sky gazers to observe the moon's enhanced appearance.
