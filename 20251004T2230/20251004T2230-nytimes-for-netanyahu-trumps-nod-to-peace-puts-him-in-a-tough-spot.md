## Article summary
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received a peace plan from President Trump that demanded Hamas release all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, disarm, and surrender any role in Gaza's future. Hamas responded by agreeing to release hostages but did not specify a timeline or commit to disarming. Senator Lindsey Graham and Michael Herzog interpreted Hamas's response as a rejection of the plan. However, President Trump viewed Hamas's statement as an acceptance and urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza to facilitate the hostages' release. This put Netanyahu in a difficult position, as the situation became more complex than anticipated.
