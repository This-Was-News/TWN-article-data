## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza in the coming days, as Israel and Hamas prepare for indirect talks in Egypt on a new U.S. plan to end the war. Netanyahu stated that Israel will not fully withdraw from Gaza and Hamas will be disarmed in the plan's second phase. Hamas has accepted some elements of the U.S. plan, while President Donald Trump urged Hamas to move quickly. Trump also ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza, though strikes continued, including one that killed at least 17 people. Israel's army has shifted to a defensive position but remains prepared for further action. The talks aim to release hostages and discuss the withdrawal of Israeli forces from certain areas in Gaza. Hamas agreed to release remaining hostages and hand over power but seeks further consultations on other aspects. Protests and cautious hope have emerged in Israel and Europe, while Palestinians in Gaza express fatigue and concern over the talks' outcome. The Palestinian death toll in the war has surpassed 67,000, with women and children making up around half of the casualties.
