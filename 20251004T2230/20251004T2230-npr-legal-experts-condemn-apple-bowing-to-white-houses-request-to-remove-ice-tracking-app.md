## Article summary
Apple and Google removed apps tracking ICE agents after pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi. The app, ICEBlock, alerted users to nearby ICE agents and was removed by Apple due to safety concerns. The developer, Joshua Aaron, criticized the move as political pressure and vowed to fight it. Legal experts argue this is an example of 'jawboning,' where government officials censor speech through intimidation. Conservatives previously accused the Biden administration of similar tactics. Apple's action has sparked debate about free expression and government influence. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been seen as aligning with Trump to avoid tariffs on iPhones. Legal experts believe Apple's compliance may encourage further government demands.
