## Article summary
Apple and Google have blocked apps that track U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sightings, following a demand from the Trump administration. The apps, like ICEBlock, were used by over a million users to alert communities about ICE activity, helping them protect themselves from raids and harassment. Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed the apps put ICE officers at risk, while developers and users argued it was their First Amendment right to monitor ICE actions. Apple and Google removed the apps citing safety risks and policy violations. Critics, including civil rights attorney Alejandra Caraballo, warned that this sets a dangerous precedent where the government dictates what apps people can use. Developers like Joshua Aaron and Sherman Austin criticized the removals, stating the apps were essential for communities living in fear of ICE. Austin's platform, StopICE.Net, also faced a subpoena from the Department of Homeland Security, which he challenged. The removals and subpoenas were seen as retaliatory attacks on First Amendment rights, with developers urging resistance against the administration's control over information.
