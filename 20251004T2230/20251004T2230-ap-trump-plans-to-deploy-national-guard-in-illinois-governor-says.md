## Article summary
The Trump administration plans to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, according to Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker. The governor received an ultimatum from the Pentagon to call up the troops or face federal intervention, which he deemed outrageous and un-American. The White House and Pentagon did not respond to inquiries about the statement. Similar deployments have occurred in other states, with Trump sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. California Gov. Gavin Newsom successfully sued to block the deployment in Los Angeles, but the Trump administration appealed the ruling. Pritzker criticized Trump's move as a manufactured performance aimed at control rather than safety. Meanwhile, federal officials reported the arrests of 13 protesters near an ICE facility in Chicago. Trump has also sent federal troops to Portland, Oregon, although their deployment has been contested by local officials. The situation remains fluid, with legal challenges and potential deployments ongoing.
