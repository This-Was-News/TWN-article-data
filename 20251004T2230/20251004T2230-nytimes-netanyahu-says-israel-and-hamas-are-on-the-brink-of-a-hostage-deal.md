Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel is close to a deal to release remaining hostages from Hamas in Gaza. He credited military and political pressure, along with President Trump's involvement, for Hamas's willingness to negotiate. Negotiations are set to resume in Egypt, with both sides aiming to finalize a hostage-prisoner exchange. Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis protested in Tel Aviv, expressing hope and fear about the potential deal. Netanyahu defended his war strategy and insisted on Hamas's disarmament and Gaza's demilitarization. President Trump expressed confidence in a deal but warned against delays. Despite progress, significant gaps remain in the negotiations, and fighting continues in Gaza.
