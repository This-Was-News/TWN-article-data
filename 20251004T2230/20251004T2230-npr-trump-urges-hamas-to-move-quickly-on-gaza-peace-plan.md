## Article summary
President Trump urged Hamas to swiftly accept a peace plan to end the two-year conflict in Gaza, warning that delay would have consequences. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope that all remaining hostages would be returned by October 13. A hospital official confirmed a significant reduction in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City, though some casualties were still reported. The White House's 20-point peace plan, partially accepted by Hamas, includes the immediate release of all hostages. Trump demanded Israel stop bombing Gaza to facilitate this. Netanyahu acknowledged a commitment to end the war in line with Trump's plans, with Israeli forces reducing their activity to defensive actions only. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will travel to Egypt for negotiations on Israeli troop positioning, humanitarian aid, and prisoner exchanges. Hamas requires approval from other Palestinian factions for the talks to succeed. Protests across Europe demand an end to the war, with the Palestinian death toll exceeding 67,000. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid supports Trump's proposal, and hostage families see the closest chance yet for their loved ones' return.
