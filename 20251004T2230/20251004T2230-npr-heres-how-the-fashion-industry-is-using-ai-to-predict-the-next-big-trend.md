## Article summary
The fashion industry is increasingly using AI to predict trends, with companies like Heuritech tracking data from runway shows and social media to identify emerging styles. AI helps in decision-making, such as choosing between red or blue stripe shirts for upcoming seasons, and creates personalized customer experiences. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest have accelerated trend dissemination, with over 40% of global consumers purchasing fashion items via social media in 2024. AI algorithms predict trends like dotted prints, flat-thong sandals, and the color yellow, which have appeared on recent runways. However, industry experts emphasize that AI cannot replace human judgment entirely, as human insight is crucial for interpreting data accurately and ensuring trends are both entertaining and commercially viable. AI's role includes supply chain management and image generation, but human expertise remains essential for making informed fashion predictions.
