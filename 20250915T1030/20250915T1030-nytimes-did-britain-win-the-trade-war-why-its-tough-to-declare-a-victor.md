## Article summary
The article discusses the complexities of determining a winner in the trade war sparked by President Trump's high tariffs. Britain quickly secured a trade agreement with the U.S., locking in 10% duties on most imports while protecting key industries. This deal seemed advantageous compared to the European Union's 15% tariff rate. However, a closer examination reveals that trade math is more intricate, with varying tariff rates by product, making it difficult to identify clear national winners or losers. The article compares tariffs on specific goods like whiskey, clothing, cars, and cheese between Britain and the EU, highlighting the nuanced nature of these trade agreements. For instance, British SUVs face a 10% tariff, while Italian SUVs face 15%, and cheese tariffs vary significantly between cheddar and gouda. The analysis underscores the challenges in declaring one deal definitively better than the other.
