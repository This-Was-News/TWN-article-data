## Article summary
After the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a growing number of conservatives are calling for the ostracization or firing of his critics. This campaign has already led to the firing or punishment of teachers, government workers, and others. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy condemned those celebrating Kirk's assassination and called for their dismissal. Conservatives view Kirk as a champion of free speech and are using tactics similar to those they criticize from the left, such as calls for firings and ostracism. This raises concerns about the nation's increasing political polarization and intolerance. Republicans are pushing to punish not only the alleged killer but also those whose words they believe contributed to the death or dishonored it. Some liberals have also faced criticism for expressing sympathy over Kirk's death. The situation highlights the challenges of free speech, especially when government officials get involved. Utah Governor Spencer Cox cautioned that the motive for the assassination has not been confirmed. Kirk was seen as a key figure in President Donald Trump's political movement, leading many conservatives to view critical remarks as fomenting violence. The aftermath of Kirk's death is testing the public's tolerance for political differences and the limits of free speech.
