## Article summary
A record number of Congressional lawmakers, totaling 10 senators and 27 House members, have announced they will not seek reelection in 2026. Fifteen are retiring from public office, while the rest are running for different positions, including governorships, Senate seats, or other roles. Republicans, with 27 members leaving, outnumber Democrats, who have 10. Notable Democratic retirees include Senators Dick Durbin and Jeanne Shaheen, and Representatives Jan Schakowsky, Dwight Evans, and Danny Davis. On the Republican side, Senators Mitch McConnell, Thom Tillis, and Jon Ernst, along with Representative Don Bacon, are retiring, all of whom have clashed with President Trump's vision of expanded executive power. The GOP, holding slim majorities in both chambers, has engaged in mid-decade gerrymandering to create more favorable districts ahead of a historically challenging election cycle. California's Democratic government is seeking voter approval for a retaliatory redistricting measure in November's off-year election. Texas' redrawn map, aimed at reducing Democratic representation by five, has led to the retirement of 78-year-old Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett, who faces a tough primary against progressive Representative Greg Casar.
