## Article summary
President Trump stated that he will impose new sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine only if NATO members agree and stop purchasing Russian oil. He emphasized that NATO's commitment to countering Russia has been less than full, with some members continuing to buy Russian oil, which weakens their negotiating position. Trump has been under pressure to increase sanctions on Russia, especially after diplomatic efforts stalled and Russia escalated aggression, including drone incursions into NATO member Poland. He previously doubled tariffs on Indian goods due to India's continued purchases of Russian energy and urged European leaders to cut off Russian oil to pressure President Vladimir Putin. Trump also proposed imposing tariffs of 50% to 100% on Chinese goods, citing China's influence over Russia. The U.S. and its allies have been cautious about restricting Russian energy trade due to potential global economic impacts. The European Union, heavily dependent on Russian energy before the invasion of Ukraine, has reduced but not entirely stopped purchases. Trump's post amplified his sentiments, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jameson Greer pressed G7 finance ministers to impose tariffs on countries buying Russian oil. Some Republican senators, like Lindsey Graham, have urged Trump to support a sanctions package to counter the mounting threat from Russia.
