## Article summary
British politicians have condemned Elon Musk's comments at an anti-migrant rally in London, where he warned of impending violence and urged protesters to fight or die. The rally, organized by far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson, saw clashes with police and counter-demonstrators, resulting in injuries and arrests. Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called for Musk to face sanctions, while other politicians criticized his remarks as dangerous and inappropriate. Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced violence but has not directly addressed Musk's comments, emphasizing the importance of peaceful protest and protecting marginalized communities. Musk, a supporter of far-right figures in Europe, has previously criticized government efforts to regulate online content. The rally follows growing political concern over unauthorized migration, particularly the arrival of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats. The use of hotels to house asylum-seekers has also sparked protests in Britain, some of which turned violent. The demonstration, one of the largest nationalist protests in decades, featured prominent displays of British and English flags, which some view as intimidating towards ethnic minorities.
