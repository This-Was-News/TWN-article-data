## Article summary
Democrats are facing pressure to adapt to new digital platforms to effectively communicate with voters. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York, emphasizes the importance of mastering 'the three threes'—30-second vertical videos, three-minute cable news hits, and three-hour filmed podcast interviews—to succeed in modern politics. He warns that politicians who fail to engage in these digital spaces risk becoming extinct. The Democratic Party has been struggling since President Trump's reelection in 2024, and analysts argue that Republicans are outperforming Democrats in online communication, particularly through video content. Svan Jacobovitz, co-founder of Van Ness Creative Strategies, highlights that many Democrats view social media as an afterthought, despite it being the primary source of news for over 50% of Americans. The recent upset win by Zohran Mamdan in New York City's mayoral primary has spurred other Democrats to enhance their online presence. However, some, like Adelta Grjalva, who won her primary despite having a smaller TikTok following, argue that social media is just one tool among many, including grassroots organizing and policy engagement. Deja Foxx, Grjalva's opponent, believes that social media is crucial for attracting young voters and that Democrats need more influential online presences. Despite the debate, the consensus is that Democrats must embrace new media to remain competitive and relevant.
