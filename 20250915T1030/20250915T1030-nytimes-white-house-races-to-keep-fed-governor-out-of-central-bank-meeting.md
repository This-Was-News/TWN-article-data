## Article summary
The Trump administration is asserting broad presidential powers to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, arguing that President Trump has the discretion to fire federal officials. The administration is seeking to block Cook from participating in an upcoming Fed meeting, citing allegations of mortgage fraud involving loan documents she signed before joining the Fed in 2022. Newly reported documents challenge the president's claims, but the administration insists the decision is unreviewable. Lawyers for the government argue that the allegations against Cook raise doubts about her trustworthiness in managing the U.S. money supply. A lower court previously blocked Trump from removing Cook, ruling that he cannot do so for conduct before her confirmation or for claims not involving her professional conduct. The administration is urging the appeals court to stay that order by Monday, ahead of the Fed's meeting. Cook's lawyers warn that preventing her from attending could cause financial market turmoil and undermine the Fed's political independence. Trump has been critical of the Fed, demanding rate cuts. The case hinges on whether Cook falsified records to obtain favorable loan terms, as alleged by Trump and his allies.
