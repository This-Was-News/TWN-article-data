## Article summary
President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump embarked on their first state visit to the United Kingdom on June 4, 2019, meeting with then-Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that King Charles had extended an unprecedented second state visit to Trump, highlighting the U.S. president's admiration for the royal family. This visit is seen as a strategic move by the UK to influence Trump on issues like support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Trump's fascination with the royal family stems partly from his mother's admiration for Queen Elizabeth II, whom he revered for her wisdom and grace. The upcoming visit includes meetings with the royal family, a carriage procession, military bands, and a state banquet at Windsor Castle. Trump's interest in the royals extends beyond glamour, as he has publicly commented on royal family dynamics and praised the monarchy's unifying role. Historian Nicole Hemmer notes that Trump's admiration for the royals aligns with his views on presidential power and monarchy, contrasting with previous U.S. presidents who avoided such associations. Trump's second state visit is expected to draw protests but is viewed as a diplomatic opportunity for the UK to leverage its soft power through the royal family.
