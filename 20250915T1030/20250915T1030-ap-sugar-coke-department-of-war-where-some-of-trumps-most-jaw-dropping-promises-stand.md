## Article summary
The article discusses several of President Donald Trump's notable promises and their current statuses. Trump has proposed renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War, which awaits congressional approval. He has also suggested renaming the Kennedy Center, but legal barriers make this unlikely. His stance on daylight saving time has shifted, and legislation to make it permanent has stalled. Trump announced that Coca-Cola would use real sugar in its U.S. products, but this will be a new product rather than a full change. He claimed tariffs could eliminate income taxes, but the tax cuts passed fell short of this goal. Trump has misrepresented the tax law's impact on Social Security benefits. His proposal for $5 million gold cards for citizenship has not led to significant changes in immigration policy. An executive order on IVF treatment lacks clear timelines or commitments. Despite boasting about ending Russia's war in Ukraine, Trump's efforts have not resulted in a peace agreement, and sanctions against Russia have not materialized.
