## Article summary
Utah prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and felony discharge of a firearm in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The 22-year-old suspect, held without bail, is accused of shooting Kirk during an outdoor appearance at Utah Valley University. Utah Governor Spencer Cox stated that Robinson is not cooperating with investigators, but his roommate, a male transitioning to female, has been cooperative and unaware of the crime. Formal criminal charges are expected by Tuesday, with potential federal charges also anticipated. The case could carry the death penalty under Utah law. Investigators are examining bullet casings for possible political or cultural motives. A memorial service for Kirk will be held next Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Additional details may emerge during upcoming congressional hearings with FBI Director Kash Patel, who faced criticism for prematurely announcing a suspect's custody.
