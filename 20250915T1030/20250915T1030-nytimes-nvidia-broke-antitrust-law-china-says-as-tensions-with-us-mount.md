## Article summary
Chinese regulators accused Nvidia of violating antitrust laws, escalating tensions with the U.S. The State Administration for Market Regulation announced the findings during U.S.-China trade talks in Madrid. The investigation, opened last December, focuses on Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, which China claims breached commitments to prevent anti-competitive practices. Nvidia's stock dropped over 2% in premarket trading. The U.S. had previously added 23 Chinese firms to a list barred from buying American technology, while China investigated U.S. suppliers of integrated circuits. Nvidia, a leader in AI chips, relies on its business with China to maintain its global dominance. CEO Jensen Huang had previously secured permission from President Trump to sell certain chips to China, drawing criticism. Additionally, China's internet regulator summoned Nvidia to address security risks related to its chips in the Chinese market.
