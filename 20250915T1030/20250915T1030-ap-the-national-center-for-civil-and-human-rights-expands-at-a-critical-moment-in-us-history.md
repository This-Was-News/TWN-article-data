## Article summary
The National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta is expanding with a $60 million renovation, adding six new galleries, classrooms, and interactive experiences. The center, privately funded, aims to promote civil and human rights, racial justice, and democracy, contrasting with efforts by the Trump administration to control historical narratives. The expansion includes immersive experiences like 'Change Agent Adventure' for children and exhibits such as 'Broken Promises,' which explores post-Civil War Reconstruction and backlash. The center also features items from the Martin Luther King Jr. collection and focuses on human rights advocates rather than genocidal leaders. The renovation, supported by donors like Home Depot co-founder Arthur M. Blank, seeks to engage visitors in advocacy and change-making, emphasizing hope and agency. The center's mission aligns with the belief that understanding and teaching civil and human rights is crucial for a healthy democracy.
