## Article summary
The U.S. Justice Department is pushing to unseal numerous court records related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, spurred by the new Epstein Files Transparency Act. This legislation mandates the public release of investigative materials concerning the pair. A court battle over sealed documents in Maxwell's criminal case is providing early insights into the potential contents of these upcoming files. Government lawyers have requested the release of a wide array of records, including search warrants, financial documents, survivor interview notes, and data from earlier Epstein investigations. These documents are currently under secrecy orders that the Justice Department aims to lift. The department is collaborating with survivors to redact sensitive information, such as identities and sexualized images. Judges have been given deadlines to detail the specific materials the government intends to make public. While previous attempts to unseal grand jury transcripts were denied, the new law has prompted the Justice Department to seek reconsideration. The law requires the release of Epstein-related files in a searchable format by December 19th. Tens of thousands of pages of records have already been released through various means over the years. The Justice Department has listed 18 categories of material it seeks to release from Maxwell's case, including reports and evidence from Florida law enforcement agencies involved in earlier Epstein investigations.
