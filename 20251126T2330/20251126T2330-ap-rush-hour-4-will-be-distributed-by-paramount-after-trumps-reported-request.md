## Article summary
Paramount Pictures is reportedly set to distribute 'Rush Hour 4' following a request from former President Donald Trump. This comes after director Brett Ratner faced sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, leading Warner Bros. to sever ties with him. Ratner, who has denied the allegations, has not produced a film this decade. The news of Paramount's potential involvement was reported by Semafor, which stated that Trump personally asked Paramount to take on the project. Paramount recently merged with Skydance in a deal that required approval from the Trump administration, and Trump has praised Skydance's leadership. 'Rush Hour 4' would reunite stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the action-comedy franchise. Ratner also recently produced a documentary on Melania Trump, which was acquired by Amazon MGM Studios. The previous three 'Rush Hour' films were released by Warner Bros., with the franchise beginning in 1998.
