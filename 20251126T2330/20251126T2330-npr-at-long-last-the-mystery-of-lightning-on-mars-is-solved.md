## Article summary
A NASA rover on Mars has accidentally detected a form of lightning, providing direct evidence for a phenomenon scientists have long suspected. The Perseverance rover's microphone picked up electrical arcs, accompanied by audible shockwaves, which researchers have detailed in a report published in Nature. This discovery addresses a significant mystery about Mars, as lightning has been observed on other planets like Jupiter and Saturn but remained elusive on its neighbors. Early experiments in the 1970s suggested lightning should exist on Mars due to electrical charges generated by friction between sand particles, similar to how lightning occurs in volcanic ash clouds on Earth. Researchers reviewing audio from the Perseverance rover noticed a brief snap or crack during a dust devil event, initially dismissed as a grain of sand hitting the rover. However, further investigation and experiments on Earth revealed that this sound matched the signature of electrical discharges. Fifty-five such events were recorded over two Martian years, primarily associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts. These electrical arcs are described as feeling and sounding like strong static electricity sparks. Studying this atmospheric electrical activity is crucial for understanding potential hazards to future robotic and human missions on Mars, as it could have impacted past missions like the Soviet Mars 3.
