## Article summary
A judge has dismissed the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump and other defendants. The dismissal came after Peter Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, took over the case and announced he would not pursue the charges. This marks the end of the last remaining court effort to prosecute Trump for his actions following the 2020 election. The case began nearly five years ago with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis investigating alleged illegal attempts to influence the state's election results. Trump's own recorded phone call urging Georgia's secretary of state to find votes was a key piece of evidence. This case was the most wide-ranging of the four criminal cases brought against Trump in 2023. The abandonment of the Georgia case follows other legal proceedings against Trump that have unraveled. The Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia was tasked with finding a new prosecutor after Willis was removed from the case due to an appearance of impropriety related to her relationship with a special prosecutor. Skandalakis stated that the criminal conduct alleged in the Georgia indictment was conceived in Washington, D.C., and that the federal government would be the appropriate venue for prosecution. He cited the complexity of the legal issues and the potential timeline for a trial as further reasons for dismissal.
