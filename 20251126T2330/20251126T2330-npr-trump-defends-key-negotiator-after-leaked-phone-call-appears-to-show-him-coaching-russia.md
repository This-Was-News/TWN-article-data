## Article summary
President Trump is defending his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, after a leaked recording suggested Witkoff coached a Russian official on how to present Moscow's terms for ending the war in Ukraine. Trump dismissed the concerns, stating that Witkoff was simply employing standard negotiation tactics to help sell a deal. The controversy has brought renewed attention to Witkoff, a long-time friend of Trump's, who has been criticized for his lack of experience and unconventional negotiation style. The recording, from an October call prior to the release of a Russia-favored peace plan, has not been independently verified by NPR. Trump characterized Witkoff's actions as typical deal-making, aimed at convincing both sides of a proposed agreement. Despite criticism that Witkoff might be favoring Russia, Trump remains unconcerned and is sending him back to Moscow to finalize details of a new plan with Putin. Witkoff and Trump share a nearly 40-year friendship, with Witkoff having deep admiration for Trump's business acumen and having received personal support from him during difficult times. Witkoff's role as envoy echoes that of Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, who also came from real estate and handled sensitive foreign policy files. Experts question Witkoff's suitability for complex geopolitical negotiations, contrasting it with real estate deals, and suggest that resolving the Ukraine war requires more than just finding common ground, but also leveraging incentives and disincentives.
