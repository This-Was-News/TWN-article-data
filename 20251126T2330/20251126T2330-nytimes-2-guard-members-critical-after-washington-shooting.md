## Article summary
Two members of the West Virginia National Guard are in critical condition after being shot near the White House on Wednesday afternoon, an incident described by the city's mayor as a targeted shooting. The suspected gunman is in custody and is believed to have acted alone. President Trump has ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington D.C. in response to the shooting. Over 2,000 National Guard members are currently deployed in the nation's capital as part of a crime crackdown initiative. The shooting occurred near the Farragut West metro station, a location where National Guard personnel have maintained a daily presence for months. Initial reports from the West Virginia governor incorrectly stated the Guardsmen had been killed, but this was later retracted due to conflicting information. The incident has rattled both locals and tourists, especially as it occurred near the Thanksgiving holiday. This attack comes amidst a controversial deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, with a federal judge having previously ruled the deployment likely illegal. The National Guard is a state-based military force that can be activated by both state governors and the president, serving as a reserve force for the Army and Air Force, and can be deployed domestically or overseas.
