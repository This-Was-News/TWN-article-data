## Article summary
In recent weeks, foreign spouses of U.S. citizens have been arrested and handcuffed immediately after their green card interviews, a tactic that immigration lawyers describe as unprecedented. Couples who believed they were completing the final step to secure their future in the United States found themselves separated as federal agents took their non-citizen spouses into custody. These individuals had followed all required procedures, submitted extensive paperwork, paid fees, and passed medical exams and background checks. Many had entered the country legally on tourist or business visas, which subsequently expired while their adjustment-of-status applications were pending. Immigration lawyers estimate dozens of spouses have been detained in San Diego alone since November 12. The government has not released official numbers, and many couples attend interviews without legal representation. While federal law allows spouses who entered lawfully to be eligible for a green card even with an expired visa, past practice rarely involved detaining them during the application process. The Trump administration is reportedly carrying out these detentions without any announced policy change, leading to accusations that the strategy aims to force couples to abandon their cases. In one instance, Katie Paul, whose husband is a U.S. citizen and a deputy sheriff, was detained with their infant child present. Her lawyer filed a lawsuit, and she was subsequently granted her green card and released. Other couples like Audrey Hestmark and Thomas Bilger, and Jason Cordero and Ludmila, have also experienced similar arrests, leading to emotional distress and legal battles to secure their spouses' release and continued pursuit of permanent residency.
