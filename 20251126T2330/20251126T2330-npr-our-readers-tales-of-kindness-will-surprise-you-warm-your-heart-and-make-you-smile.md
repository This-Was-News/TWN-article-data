## Article summary
NPR's Goats and Soda shared reader-submitted stories of kindness, highlighting how small gestures can have a profound impact. One story recounts a teacher who bought new shoes for a second-grader and later gifted her books, significantly influencing the student's life. Another narrative details the compassionate care provided by hospital staff to a dying COVID-19 patient and their family, including a nurse who bathed the intubated patient so he could attend his daughter's virtual wedding. The piece also features a man who started a pay-it-forward chain at a drive-thru, which eventually led to his own coffee being paid for by a recipient. A woman shares her experience of receiving crucial support from her community after escaping an abusive marriage, receiving help with housing, work, and legal custody. Additionally, a story describes a sister's comforting presence during a time of grief, and another highlights a long-term act of kindness where a traveler funded a young girl's education in Ethiopia, who later demonstrated her own empathetic nature by supporting a struggling child vendor. These accounts collectively emphasize that goodness persists and that acts of kindness, no matter how small, create lasting positive ripples in the world.
