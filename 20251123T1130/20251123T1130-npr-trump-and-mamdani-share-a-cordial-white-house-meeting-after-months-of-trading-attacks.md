## Article summary
President Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a cordial meeting in the Oval Office, a significant shift after months of trading political insults. Trump, who had previously labeled Mamdani a "communist" and "despot," praised the mayor-elect's campaign and expressed a willingness to work together on issues like the cost of living and crime reduction. Mamdani, who had previously called Trump a "despot," reciprocated the sentiment, stating he enjoyed the conversation and looked forward to cooperating on affordability for New Yorkers. Despite past animosity, including Trump's threats to withhold federal funding and false claims about Mamdani's citizenship, the meeting revealed surprising areas of agreement. Both leaders expressed a desire for lower crime rates, increased housing construction, and reduced rents, though they acknowledged potential differences in their approaches. Trump even defended Mamdani against conservative attacks, calling him a "rational person" and stating he would be "cheering for him." The meeting suggests a temporary truce in their public rhetoric, with Trump indicating a desire to help Mamdani succeed.
