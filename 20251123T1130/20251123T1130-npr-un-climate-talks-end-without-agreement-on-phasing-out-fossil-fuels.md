## Article summary
The U.N. climate summit, COP30, concluded in Brazil without a formal agreement on phasing out fossil fuels, despite calls from over 80 countries for a clear transition roadmap. The United States did not participate in the negotiations. While the final agreement acknowledged the need for "deep, rapid and sustained" cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, it omitted any specific mention of fossil fuels, disappointing many nations. Major fossil-fuel producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed a timetable for moving away from these energy sources. The planet is projected to exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming limit in the next decade, and current policies are insufficient to meet the necessary emission reduction targets. Progress on funding climate adaptation for developing nations was also modest, with commitments for financial assistance still uncertain. China, absent the U.S., played a significant role, advocating for trade in green technologies. A key outcome was the announcement of a new conference, hosted by Colombia and the Netherlands in April, specifically dedicated to phasing out fossil fuels, which some see as a crucial step forward amidst the broader U.N. process's limitations.
