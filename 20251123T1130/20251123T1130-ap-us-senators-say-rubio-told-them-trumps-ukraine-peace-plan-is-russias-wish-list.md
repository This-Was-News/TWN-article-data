## Article summary
U.S. senators critical of former President Donald Trump's approach to ending the Russia-Ukraine war claim that Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed them that Trump's proposed peace plan is essentially Russia's "wish list" and not an official U.S. proposal. This assertion was made by Senators Angus King and Mike Rounds, among others, at the Halifax International Security Forum. Rubio, however, denied this account through a State Department spokesperson, calling it "blatantly false," and later posted on X that the plan was authored by the U.S. with input from both Russia and Ukraine. The U.S.-backed peace plan, which reportedly includes concessions to Russia such as territorial relinquishment, has been met with skepticism from some senators who believe it rewards Russian aggression. Trump has urged Kyiv to accept the plan by the following week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not outright rejected the plan but has emphasized the need for fair treatment. The situation has created confusion and potential embarrassment for the Trump administration, especially given the plan's favorable terms towards Moscow and Putin's welcoming response to it.
