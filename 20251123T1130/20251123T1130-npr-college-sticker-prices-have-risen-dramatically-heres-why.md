## Article summary
The sticker price of college tuition has dramatically increased over the past 30 years, with average tuition for both public and private four-year institutions essentially doubling after adjusting for inflation. While this rise is significant, many families do not pay the full sticker price due to financial aid and merit aid, resulting in a lower net price. In recent years, the net price trend has been more flat or even declining for some students. Several factors contribute to the rising sticker price, including declining state funding for public institutions, administrative bloat, and the increasing availability of student loans, which some argue colleges absorb through tuition hikes. Additionally, competition among institutions and the perception of prestige associated with high price tags play a role. The college market is often opaque, making it difficult for families to compare costs and for colleges to compete on price. Efforts to address this include standardizing financial aid offer letters and exploring tuition freezes, as exemplified by Purdue University, which has maintained its tuition rate for over a decade by increasing enrollment and diversifying revenue streams. Affordable options, such as community colleges and federal grants like the Pell Grant, also exist for students seeking to reduce college costs.
