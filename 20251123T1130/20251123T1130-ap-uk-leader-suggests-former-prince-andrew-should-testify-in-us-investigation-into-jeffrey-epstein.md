## Article summary
Pressure is mounting for Prince Andrew to testify in a U.S. congressional investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggesting that anyone with relevant information should cooperate with investigators. Starmer stated that as a general principle, people should provide evidence to those who need it, though he declined to comment on Andrew's specific case. The former prince, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has thus far ignored a request for a transcribed interview from members of the House Oversight Committee regarding his relationship with Epstein. Andrew was stripped of his royal titles and honors recently as the royal family sought to distance themselves from the controversy. His lack of cooperation has drawn criticism from U.S. Representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, who are part of the committee. They issued a statement asserting that their investigation will proceed regardless of Andrew's participation and that they are committed to holding accountable anyone involved in Epstein's crimes, ensuring justice for survivors. The committee aims to uncover the full extent of Epstein's network and the involvement of others, regardless of their standing.
