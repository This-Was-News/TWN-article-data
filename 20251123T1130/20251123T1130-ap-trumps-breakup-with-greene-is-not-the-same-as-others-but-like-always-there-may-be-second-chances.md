## Article summary
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent MAGA figure and former staunch ally of Donald Trump, has announced plans to resign from Congress in January, marking a significant break from the former president. This departure is notable because Greene, unlike many other Republicans who have clashed with Trump, shares his pugilistic style and supported his false claims about the 2020 election. Their falling out reportedly stems from disagreements over the Jeffrey Epstein files and healthcare policy, rather than ideological differences. Trump, however, has a history of reconciling with former critics, often bringing them back into his fold. He has referred to Greene as a "nice person" after previously calling her a "traitor," and stated he can "patch up differences with anyone." Greene herself has acknowledged Trump's potential power in her district, suggesting she wanted to spare constituents an ugly primary fight. Despite the break, Greene remains a significant figure with personal financial security, a large social media following, and a presence in conservative media, leaving her with various options for future political endeavors, including a potential run for Georgia governor or a U.S. Senate seat.
