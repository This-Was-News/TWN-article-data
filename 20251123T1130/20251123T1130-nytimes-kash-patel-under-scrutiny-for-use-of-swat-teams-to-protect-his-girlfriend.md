## Article summary
FBI Director Kash Patel is facing scrutiny for his use of taxpayer-funded resources, including SWAT teams to protect his girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, an aspiring country singer. Patel allegedly ordered SWAT agents to protect Wilkins at an NRA convention, later reprimanding the team commander when they left early. This incident, along with his use of government jets for personal travel, such as a golf trip to Scotland, has raised questions within the administration about the appropriateness of his actions. Security details for Wilkins have drawn particular attention, with critics questioning why she receives such protection. While Patel's spokesman asserts that Wilkins faces credible threats justifying the security measures, former FBI officials and tactical experts find the use of SWAT teams for VIP protection unusual and potentially legally problematic. Patel has also been criticized for his extensive use of the director's private jet, contrasting with his past criticisms of former Director James Comey's travel expenses. His administration has also faced budget cuts, making the spending on resources for personal use more contentious. Despite these criticisms, Patel's spokesman maintains that all actions are justified and adhere to ethical guidelines.
