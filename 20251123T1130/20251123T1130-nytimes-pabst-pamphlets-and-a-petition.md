## Article summary
At the 141st Harvard-Yale football game, students and alumni set aside their traditional rivalry to unite against perceived attacks on higher education by the Trump administration. Groups like Crimson Courage and Stand Up for Yale organized a joint tailgate party, using the event to gather signatures for a petition urging university leaders to resist agreements that would allow government interference in university affairs. Volunteers, including notable figures like lawyer George Conway and Senator Richard Blumenthal, distributed information and stickers to raise awareness about defending academic freedom and the First Amendment. Despite the intense competition between the universities, the initiative highlighted a shared concern for the autonomy of educational institutions. Volunteers emphasized the importance of a united front, with one stating, "Hang together or hang separately." While some attendees expressed loyalty to their alma mater by refusing certain stickers, the overall sentiment focused on solidarity for academic freedom. The event underscored the "real fear" among college administrators regarding potential repercussions from the Trump administration. The game itself saw Yale upset Harvard with a score of 45-28.
