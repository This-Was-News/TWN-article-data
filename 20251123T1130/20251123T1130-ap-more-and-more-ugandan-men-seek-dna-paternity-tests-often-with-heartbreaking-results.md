## Article summary
In Uganda, an increasing number of men are seeking DNA paternity tests, often leading to distressing discoveries that they are not the biological fathers of their children. This trend is fueled by greater accessibility to DNA testing and high-profile cases reported in the media. Religious leaders and traditional elders are urging tolerance and advising men to accept children as their own, drawing parallels to biblical figures like Joseph. The Ministry of Internal Affairs reports that approximately 95% of men seeking voluntary DNA tests are not the biological fathers, with over 98% of results confirming this. DNA testing centers are widely advertised, even on passenger taxis in Kampala, though the cost of testing, over $200 at a private lab, remains a barrier for many. Paternity disputes are now frequently linked to property distribution after a patriarch's death and contested divorce settlements. Traditional practices in Uganda viewed public paternity concerns as taboo and punishable. However, modern legal and personal disputes are bringing these issues to the forefront. Faith leaders, like Archbishop Stephen Kaziimba, counsel men to emulate Joseph's acceptance of Jesus. Counselors and pastors are also addressing these disputes within their congregations. Despite appeals for acceptance, religious leaders anticipate more men will pursue DNA testing if costs decrease. The cultural shift challenges long-held traditions and creates significant family turmoil.
