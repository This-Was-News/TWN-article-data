## Article summary
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation from Congress blindsided her conservative Georgia district, which had largely supported her despite her controversial rhetoric and spread of conspiracy theories. Voters in her district respected her for her consistent alignment with former President Trump and for her clear stance on issues. However, a growing rift between Greene and Trump emerged, fueled by her persistent calls for the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files and her accusations that the Trump administration was obstructing their release. Greene also claimed Trump was neglecting domestic concerns important to his voters. Despite these developments, many constituents in her district felt confident that her decision was not due to a lack of local support. Meredith Rosson, a local Republican Party chairwoman, expressed that Greene had "stood her ground," reflecting a sentiment of loyalty among her constituents who appreciated her unwavering positions.
