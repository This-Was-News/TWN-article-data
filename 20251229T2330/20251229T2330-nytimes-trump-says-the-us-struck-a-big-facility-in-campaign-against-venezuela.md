## Article summary
President Trump announced that the U.S. struck a significant facility in Venezuela as part of an effort to disrupt drug trafficking. While officials confirmed the strike on a drug facility, they offered no specific details. Trump described the target as a "big facility" or "implementation area" where drugs were loaded onto boats. This appears to be the first known land-based attack in the U.S. campaign against Venezuelan drug trafficking. Venezuela is known for its role in trafficking cocaine from Colombia, though not as a major producer. The strike is part of an intensified pressure campaign against Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, who faces U.S. drug trafficking charges. The U.S. has been conducting military strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats since September, which critics have labeled extrajudicial killings. These boat strikes were part of a broader operation that included plans for strikes on land facilities. The U.S. has also imposed a blockade on Venezuela, intercepting oil tankers to cut off government income. Trump has previously authorized the CIA to plan covert operations within Venezuela.
