## Article summary
Many American farmers are facing significant financial challenges as they head into 2026, despite President Trump's promises of brighter days and a $12 billion federal aid package. Farmers like Kevin Deinert in South Dakota are struggling with unprofitable harvests, high costs for equipment and fertilizer, and uncertainty surrounding trade deals, particularly with China. While the White House claims China has agreed to significantly increase soybean purchases, farmers remain skeptical without concrete agreements. The recent aid package, termed "bridge payments," is viewed by some as insufficient and too late, with bankers urging some farmers to sell their operations. Experts predict that over half of farmers may not turn a profit next year, raising concerns about a potential repeat of the 1980s farm crisis, which could lead to further rural depopulation and the closure of small-town businesses. Farmers are questioning the long-term strategy behind trade policies, feeling like they are bearing the brunt of trade disputes. However, not all sectors of agriculture are struggling. Cattle ranchers, like Kory Bierle, are experiencing a reprieve due to high beef prices, offering some optimism amidst the broader agricultural downturn. Despite the challenges, Bierle expresses hope, but remains cautious about expanding his herd, aware of the potential for unforeseen economic shocks.
