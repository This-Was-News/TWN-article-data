## Article summary
President Donald Trump has conditionally endorsed Israel's right to strike Iran if the country continues its nuclear weapons program or missile development. Trump stated that an immediate strike would be warranted if Iran rapidly pursued nuclear weapons. These remarks were made ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida. Trump expressed concern over reports of Iran rebuilding its nuclear and missile program after previous U.S. strikes, vowing to "eradicate that buildup" if confirmed. The meeting also focused on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, which includes amnesty for Hamas members who disarm and cede power to a multinational peace force. Trump warned Hamas that they would face severe consequences if they did not disarm within a short period. Prime Minister Netanyahu described the summit as "very, very productive" and announced that Trump would receive the prestigious Israel Prize for his work on Gaza peace negotiations, marking the first time the award is given to a non-Israeli.
