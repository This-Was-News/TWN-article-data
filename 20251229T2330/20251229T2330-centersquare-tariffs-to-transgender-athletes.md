## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court is set to address several high-profile cases in 2026, impacting areas such as transgender athletes, birthright citizenship, presidential firing power, tariffs, redistricting, gun rights, and climate change lawsuits. The case of Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump will test President Trump's authority to levy tariffs. Louisiana v. Callais could determine the legality of state redistricting efforts, particularly concerning majority-Black districts. Trump v. Barbara challenges the interpretation of the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. Two cases, Little v. Hecox and B.P.J. v. West Virginia, will examine whether limiting transgender individuals' participation in women's sports based on biological sex violates the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. The court will also revisit gun laws in U.S. v. Hemani and Wolford v. Lopez, potentially expanding gun access. Trump v. Slaughter will decide the extent of the president's authority to fire members of federal executive boards. Finally, Chevron Inc., v. Plaquemines Parish will address a state court's ability to litigate against an oil company for its production activities, even with federal permits.
