## Article summary
President Donald Trump has hinted that the U.S. has struck a dock facility in South America, potentially in Venezuela, as part of an intensified effort to combat drug smuggling. Trump stated that the U.S. hit a facility where boats accused of carrying drugs load up, and that this location is "no longer around." This statement follows previous U.S. military strikes on drug-carrying boats in international waters. The U.S. military confirmed a strike on Monday in the eastern Pacific Ocean, resulting in two deaths. Since early September, the Trump administration has reported at least 107 fatalities across 30 strikes. Trump declined to specify the exact location or the military branch responsible for the shore strike, only indicating it was "along the shore." He had previously mentioned on Friday that the U.S. had "knocked out" a large facility where ships load drugs. While the Pentagon typically announces such strikes, no official announcement regarding a facility strike has been made. The White House and the Venezuelan government have not immediately responded to requests for further details. Trump has previously suggested the possibility of land strikes in South America and authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela. The administration claims these operations are aimed at stopping the flow of narcotics into the U.S., while Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro asserts the operations are intended to force him from power.
