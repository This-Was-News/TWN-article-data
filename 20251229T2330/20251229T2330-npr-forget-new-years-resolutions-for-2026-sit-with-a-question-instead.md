## Article summary
Krista Tippett, host of the radio show "On Being," suggests embracing questions rather than New Year's resolutions for 2026. After years of asking guests profound questions, Tippett realized the importance of turning introspective. Inspired by poet Rainer Maria Rilke, she advocates for patiently living with unresolved questions, believing that genuine answers emerge over time. Tippett proposes questions like "What in the way I'm living now and working now depletes me, and what is life giving… and are the things I'm struggling with now the right things for me to be struggling with?" to navigate life changes. She believes that in times of crisis, the act of dwelling on a question can be transformative, whereas rushing for an answer can diminish the significance of uncertainty. For the new year, Tippett encourages selecting an open-ended question to serve as a companion, guiding reflections and personal growth throughout the year. She emphasizes that the question itself can evolve, and the process of exploration is more valuable than immediate answers. This approach aligns with a more organic understanding of time, allowing for emergence and discovery rather than demanding premature conclusions. Tippett suggests revisiting the chosen question for guidance, trusting that new insights will surface as you engage with it.
