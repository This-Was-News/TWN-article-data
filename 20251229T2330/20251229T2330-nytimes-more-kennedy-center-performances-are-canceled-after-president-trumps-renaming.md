## Article summary
Doug Varone and Dancers have canceled a two-night performance at the Kennedy Center, originally planned to celebrate their 40th anniversary, due to the center's recent renaming. The company cited financial devastation but moral exhilaration for their decision. This follows similar protests from artists like folk singer Kristy Lee, who withdrew from a free concert, stating that while canceling shows hurts financially, losing integrity costs more than any paycheck. The Kennedy Center's chairman, Richard Grenell, has responded assertively to some cancellations, even threatening a lawsuit against artist Redd for withdrawing from a Christmas Eve concert. Grenell characterized such withdrawals as "classic intolerance" in response to the renaming, which honors President Trump's efforts. These cancellations highlight the challenges faced by Grenell and Trump in rebranding the center in the president's name. Other notable artists, including Rhiannon Giddens, Renée Fleming, and Ben Folds, also canceled performances or resigned from advisory roles in February. The Kennedy Center Honors, featuring handpicked artists and televised on CBS, recently took place, hosted by the president. Doug Varone and Dancers were scheduled to perform in April, honoring former top dance administrators. The company stated they could no longer ask audiences to "step inside this once great institution."
