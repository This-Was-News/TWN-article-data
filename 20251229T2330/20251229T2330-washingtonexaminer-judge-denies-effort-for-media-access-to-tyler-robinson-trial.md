## Article summary
A Utah judge has denied media organizations' requests to intervene as limited parties in the murder trial of Tyler Robinson, who is accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk. While Judge Tony Graf allowed the release of a redacted transcript and audio from a previous closed-door hearing, he ruled against granting the media increased access by intervening in the case. The media groups had sought to be parties to argue against potential closures of court hearings and to receive notice of any efforts to seal documents. Judge Graf stated that the press does not need to be a party to a criminal action to pursue the public's presumptive right to access court records and pointed to existing court procedures for challenging access obstacles. He acknowledged the foundational importance of openness and transparency in the judicial system but noted that the public's right to access is qualified and can be limited with legal justification. Robinson faces charges that could result in the death penalty for the alleged assassination on the Utah Valley University campus in September. The trial is anticipated to be closely watched in 2026, with a decision on whether video cameras will be allowed in the courtroom expected early next year. Robinson appeared via audio during the recent virtual hearing and is expected to be present at the next court proceeding on January 16.
