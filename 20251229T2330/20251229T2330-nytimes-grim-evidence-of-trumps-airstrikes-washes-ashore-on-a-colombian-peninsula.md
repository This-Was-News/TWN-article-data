## Article summary
Evidence of U.S. airstrikes against suspected drug-smuggling boats, part of the Trump administration's campaign against "narco-terrorists," has washed ashore on Colombia's Guajira Peninsula. This includes a scorched 30-foot boat, charred debris, and two bodies, representing the first physical evidence of a campaign that has destroyed 29 vessels and killed over 100 people. The U.S. military has not provided evidence that the targeted boats were transporting illicit substances. Analysis suggests the strike occurred in the Gulf of Venezuela, and the wreckage matches a vessel shown in a video released by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The remote Guajira Peninsula, largely governed by the Indigenous Wayuu community, has limited state presence, contributing to the delayed discovery of the evidence. Legal experts question the legality of the strikes, arguing the military cannot target civilians unless they pose an immediate threat. The Guajira Peninsula is a known smuggling hub, with local drug trade often involving smaller, community-based operations. The strikes have instilled fear in local fishermen, impacting their livelihoods and leading some to seek work elsewhere. Some fishermen have also reported seeing drones flying above their boats since the November strike.
