## Article summary
President Donald Trump expressed anger at Ukraine for allegedly attacking Russian President Vladimir Putin's residence, a claim he learned directly from Putin. Trump stated he was "very angry about it" and emphasized that "it's not the right time" for such actions, seemingly affirming the Kremlin's account. He also highlighted his decision to withhold Tomahawk missiles from Ukraine, suggesting it was a prudent move given the circumstances. When questioned about independent U.S. intelligence confirmation of the attack, Trump acknowledged the possibility that it might not have happened but reiterated that Putin had informed him of the incident. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov characterized the alleged attack as a large-scale drone operation and warned of unspecified retaliatory strikes, also stating Russia would need to revise its peace negotiations but not withdraw from talks with the U.S. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vehemently denied the allegations, calling the reports a "complete fabrication" intended to justify further Russian attacks and undermine diplomatic efforts. Zelensky asserted that Ukraine does not engage in actions that undermine diplomacy, contrasting it with Russia's behavior. This incident followed a meeting between Trump and Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump expressed optimism about a potential deal. The week preceding this meeting saw significant aerial assaults on Ukraine, with Zelensky reporting thousands of drones, bombs, and missiles targeting the country.
