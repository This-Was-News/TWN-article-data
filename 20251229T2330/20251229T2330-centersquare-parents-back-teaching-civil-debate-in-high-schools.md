## Article summary
A recent survey by EdChoice reveals that a majority of parents believe teaching civil debate and discourse skills in high school is important. Specifically, 65% of parents surveyed consider these skills very important for high school students. The survey also indicated a preference for integrating debate skills into core subjects like English, math, and science, rather than making debate a standalone required course. Parents generally view their children's schools as effective in teaching durable skills, with most believing this responsibility should be shared between schools and families. The emphasis on these skills significantly influences parental school choice decisions, with over 80% stating their importance. The survey also touched upon other education-related topics, showing strong parental support for education savings accounts and 529 plans for K-12 education. Additionally, a majority of parents favor allowing cellphones at school, though not necessarily for use in the classroom. The EdChoice survey was conducted by Morning Consult, sampling 2,250 adults and 1,300 school parents between August and November.
