## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court's 2025 decisions demonstrated a strong adherence to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution, influencing key social and legal issues. Notably, the court limited the use of nationwide injunctions, allowing states to prohibit hormone therapy for minors, and upheld restrictions on online pornography access for children. Religious liberty was also affirmed in two significant cases, one allowing parents to opt children out of gender identity-related reading materials and another protecting a Catholic charity's religious tax exemption. Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network highlighted the court's focus on constitutional limits and a return to judicial restraint. The ruling against universal injunctions in Trump v. CASA aims to reduce frivolous lawsuits against the government. In Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the court upheld Texas's age verification law for sensitive online content, emphasizing the state's power to protect minors. Looking ahead to 2026, the court is expected to clarify the originalist stance on executive branch authority in cases concerning presidential power to dismiss officials and impose tariffs.
