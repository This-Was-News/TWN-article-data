## Article summary
Homeland Security officials are conducting a significant fraud investigation in Minneapolis, focusing on childcare and other widespread fraudulent activities. This investigation follows years of scrutiny, notably stemming from a $300 million scheme at the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, which led to convictions for 57 defendants in Minnesota. Prosecutors have identified this as the largest COVID-19-related fraud in the country, exploiting a federal program for children's meals. Concerns have been raised that a substantial portion of federal funds allocated to Minnesota since 2018 may have been stolen. Minnesota's governor has pledged to work with federal partners to combat this fraud. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem shared a video showing officers entering a business as part of this large-scale investigation. The FBI has also increased its presence and resources in Minnesota to dismantle these fraud schemes, with the director stating that previous arrests were only the "tip of the iceberg." The investigation has also highlighted tensions between state and federal enforcement, particularly concerning the Somali community in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where many defendants in these fraud cases are from. Governor Walz's administration has been working to crack down on fraud through prosecutions, enhanced oversight, and audits.
