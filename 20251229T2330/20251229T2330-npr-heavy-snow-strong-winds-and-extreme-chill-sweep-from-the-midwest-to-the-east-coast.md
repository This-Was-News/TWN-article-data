## Article summary
A powerful cyclone system is bringing severe winter weather across the northern United States, from the Midwest to the East Coast. Heavy snow, extreme cold, and damaging winds are creating hazardous conditions, with blizzard warnings in effect for millions of people. The storm is expected to reach its peak intensity on Monday morning before moving into southeastern Canada. While snowfall intensity will decrease in the Great Lakes region, lake-effect snow could persist into Wednesday. New England is experiencing a mix of sleet and freezing rain, with high winds expected in parts of Massachusetts. Beyond the snow, an Arctic cold front is causing drastic temperature drops across the central U.S. and the South, ending a recent warm spell. Dallas saw temperatures plummet from the 80s to the 40s, and Florida is bracing for lows in the 30s and 40s. The Midwest is anticipating snowfall of a foot or more in some areas, leading to potential whiteout conditions and power outages. Cities like Marquette, Michigan, are prepared for the storm, with officials prioritizing public safety and public works crews ready to clear roads. Residents in these areas often embrace the winter weather, appreciating the distinct seasons.
