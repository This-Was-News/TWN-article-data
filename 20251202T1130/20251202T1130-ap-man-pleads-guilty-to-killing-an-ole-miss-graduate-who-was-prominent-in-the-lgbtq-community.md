## Article summary
Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr. has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and tampering charges in the death of Jimmie Jay Lee, an Ole Miss graduate prominent in the LGBTQ+ community. Lee disappeared from Oxford in July 2022, and his skeletal remains were found in a wooded area in February of this year. Herrington was arrested two weeks after Lee's disappearance and initially charged with capital murder. A mistrial was declared last year when the jury could not reach a verdict, and Lee's body had not yet been found. Prosecutors allege that Herrington killed Lee after a sexual encounter, presenting evidence of online searches about strangulation and sexually explicit messages exchanged between the two. Surveillance footage showed Lee leaving his apartment and later returning, with subsequent messages sent from a location near Herrington's apartment. Herrington was also seen on video picking up a shovel and wheelbarrow around the time of the murder. Both Herrington and Lee were University of Mississippi graduates. Lee was known for his fashion, makeup, and drag performances. Herrington is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday.
