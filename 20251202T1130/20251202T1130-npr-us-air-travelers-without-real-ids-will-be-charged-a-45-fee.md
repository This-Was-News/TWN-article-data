## Article summary
Beginning in February, air travelers in the U.S. without a REAL ID will face a $45 fee. While the REAL ID has been required since May, passengers without it have been allowed to proceed with additional screening and a warning. The Department of Homeland Security aims to encourage compliance, as 94% of passengers are already compliant. The REAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or ID card that meets enhanced requirements following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Obtaining this ID, marked by a white star in a yellow circle, requires more documentation than standard IDs. Starting February 1, travelers 18 and older flying domestically without a REAL ID or another accepted form of identification, like a passport, will pay a non-refundable fee to use the TSA's "Confirm.ID" system for identity verification. This fee does not guarantee verification, and unverified travelers may be denied boarding. The verification, if approved, is valid for 10 days. The TSA initially proposed an $18 charge but increased it due to higher-than-expected costs for the alternative identification program. Other acceptable IDs include military IDs, permanent resident cards, and digital IDs via mobile wallets at over 250 airports.
