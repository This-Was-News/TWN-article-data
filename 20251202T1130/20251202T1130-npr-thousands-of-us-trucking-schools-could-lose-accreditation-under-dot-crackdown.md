## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Transportation is initiating a crackdown on trucking schools, with plans to revoke the accreditation of nearly 3,000 schools and trainers within 30 days if they don't meet federal requirements. An additional 4,000 providers may face similar action. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the goal is to curb illegal and reckless practices that result in poorly trained drivers operating large vehicles. These nearly 3,000 schools and trainers represent over 40% of the nation's 16,000 authorized training providers. The DOT alleges these entities falsified training data, failed to meet curriculum and instructor standards, and mishandled records. This action is part of a broader Trump administration effort to ensure commercial driver's license (CDL) holders are qualified. The administration also proposed new restrictions on immigrants obtaining CDLs, but these were temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court. Critics argue there is no data to support claims that foreign-born truckers are less safe and view the regulations as an immigration crackdown. The situation leaves immigrant truckers in a precarious position. However, some industry figures, like trucking company owner Pawan Singh, agree that safety crackdowns are necessary, noting that untrained drivers, regardless of origin, pose a danger.
