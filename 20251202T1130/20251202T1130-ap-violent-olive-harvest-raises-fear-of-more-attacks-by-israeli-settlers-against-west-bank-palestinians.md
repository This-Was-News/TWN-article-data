## Article summary
Fear is palpable in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya, where farmers harvest crops quickly and remain vigilant against potential attacks by armed Israeli settlers. In recent months, the village has experienced near-daily settler assaults, often linked to the establishment of new outposts on Palestinian land. These attacks include physical beatings, the burning of cars, desecration of mosques, and destruction of property. During the October olive harvest, settlers launched an average of eight attacks daily across the West Bank, the highest number since 2006. Israeli authorities have largely offered only condemnations, with investigations into settler violence plummeting in recent years and rarely resulting in indictments or convictions. The expansion of outposts, such as Emek Shilo founded on private Palestinian land, further exacerbates the situation, allowing settlers to control land and water sources. These outposts can evolve into authorized settlements, threatening the existence of Palestinian communities. Despite facing violence, including a severe assault on a grandmother harvesting olives, Palestinians are determined to return to their land, highlighting a deeply entrenched conflict fueled by unchecked settler expansion and violence.
