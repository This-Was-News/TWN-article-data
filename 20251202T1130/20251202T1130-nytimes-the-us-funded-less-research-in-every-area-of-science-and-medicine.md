## Article summary
Federal funding for scientific research and development has seen significant reductions in 2025, impacting numerous fields across major funding agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NIH experienced a 22% overall decrease in new grants awarded, with particularly sharp declines in areas such as minority health (-61%), nursing (-51%), and human genome research (-47%). Similarly, the NSF saw a 25% reduction in new grants, affecting almost all scientific directorates, with social sciences experiencing a 46% cut and biology a 36% cut. The only area within the NSF to see growth was the Office of the Director, which increased by 55%, largely due to a push to expand fellowships in historically underfunded regions. The Trump administration has also controversially canceled or frozen thousands of active NIH and NSF grants, citing a lack of alignment with its priorities, though many have since been reinstated. This overall reduction in grants has led to increased competition for federal funding, with prestigious NIH R01 grants seeing a 24% decrease in awards. Furthermore, there has been a noticeable drop in NIH grants mentioning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) keywords, reflecting a prioritization shift away from such research. The funding cuts have also extended to fellowships for future scientists, with the NSF awarding significantly fewer graduate research fellowships, particularly in life sciences, psychology, STEM education, and social sciences. These reductions raise concerns about the long-term impact on scientific progress and America's global leadership in science, with some experts noting a trend of scientists leaving the United States.
