## Article summary
Authorities in Stockton, California, are searching for a suspect after a deadly shooting at a child's birthday party left four children and a 21-year-old dead. At least 100 people were gathered at a banquet hall when gunfire erupted, with detectives believing the shooting continued outside and may have involved multiple shooters. Eleven others were wounded, one critically. The San Joaquin County Sheriff urged anyone with information, including video footage or witness accounts, to come forward, emphasizing the community's need to reject such violence. Investigators suspect the incident was targeted, though the motive and specific target remain unclear. A relative of one of the victims described the event as senseless, questioning who would shoot up a child's party. The mayor highlighted the tragic loss of young lives, noting that the 8-year-old victim attended a local school and that counselors would be available for students. Separately, five individuals, including a juvenile, were arrested on weapons and gang-related charges hours after the shooting, but these arrests are not believed to be connected to the banquet hall killings.
