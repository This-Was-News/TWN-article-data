## Article summary
For the first time since its inception in 1988, the United States is not officially commemorating World AIDS Day. The State Department stated that "an awareness day is not a strategy," signaling a shift in approach to combating infectious diseases. This decision contrasts with previous years, where the U.S. consistently marked the day with presidential acknowledgments and events, including a significant ceremony with the AIDS Memorial Quilt last year. While other countries continue to observe World AIDS Day with various initiatives, the U.S. administration has opted not to participate. This move has drawn criticism from HIV/AIDS activists who view it as emblematic of an administration that lacks concern for the ongoing epidemic. The U.S. has historically been a major financial supporter of the global fight against HIV/AIDS through initiatives like PEPFAR. However, recent cuts to global health spending and a focus on an "America First" approach have raised concerns about the impact on HIV/AIDS care in various countries. Activists argue that the decision not to commemorate World AIDS Day is a symbolic act reflecting a broader disregard for the issue, reminiscent of the early days of the epidemic when it was highly stigmatized. They emphasize that commemorative days, even if seemingly minor, play a crucial role in combating stigma and maintaining momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The administration's decision aligns with a broader skepticism towards multilateral organizations like the WHO and the UN.
