## Article summary
The Supreme Court is hearing a significant copyright case involving the music industry and internet provider Cox Communications. The music industry coalition is suing Cox, alleging the company should be held liable for its users' copyright infringements. The coalition claims Cox was repeatedly notified about serial copyright abusers using its service but failed to take adequate action. They argue Cox's anti-infringement measures were superficial and that the company prioritized profit over legal compliance, even citing a manager who allegedly dismissed copyright law. A jury and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the coalition, awarding over a billion dollars in damages. Cox, however, argues it should not be liable, stating it did not encourage infringement, prohibits illegal activity in its terms of service, and does not profit from user infringements. The company also warns that a ruling against them could lead to the termination of internet access for entire households, businesses, and institutions due to the actions of a few users. A decision in this billion-dollar case is anticipated this summer.
