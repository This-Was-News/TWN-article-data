## Article summary
The White House asserts that a Navy admiral acted lawfully in ordering a second strike on an alleged drug boat in September, following an initial strike that reportedly left survivors. This justification comes amid bipartisan scrutiny and an impending congressional review of U.S. military operations against suspected drug smuggling vessels. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has stated his full support for Admiral Frank Mitch Bradley, who ordered the follow-up strike, emphasizing that the action was within his authority and aimed to eliminate threats to the U.S. President Donald Trump has also defended Hegseth, stating he believes the Defense Secretary did not order the death of survivors. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed serious concerns and are seeking clarity, with some demanding the release of strike footage. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has condemned the U.S. actions as "psychological terrorism" and announced a national investigation into the lethal strikes, which have resulted in over 80 deaths. The U.S. administration claims these strikes are necessary to combat drug cartels linked to Maduro's regime, and Trump is considering further actions against Venezuela.
