## Article summary
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national accused of shooting two National Guard soldiers in Washington D.C., including one fatality, had previously appeared hopeful upon arriving in the U.S. However, over time, he reportedly became withdrawn and isolated, leading a volunteer to express concerns about his mental well-being and potential suicidal ideation. Emails from January 2024 indicated Lakanwal was spending most of his time in his room, not speaking to anyone, and the volunteer suspected he might be suffering from PTSD due to his past work with the U.S. military in Afghanistan. While Homeland Security officials suggested Lakanwal may have been radicalized in the U.S., the volunteer observed no signs of radicalization, only a deepening personal crisis exacerbated by language barriers and cultural isolation. Before coming to the U.S. in 2021, Lakanwal served in an elite counterterrorism unit that worked with the CIA. The volunteer noted Lakanwal's increasingly erratic behavior, including long, unannounced cross-country drives, but never perceived him as a threat. Efforts by volunteers to find professional help for Lakanwal from refugee aid groups yielded limited results, with concerns raised about dwindling resources for refugee families. Activists argue Lakanwal's alleged actions are an isolated incident and do not represent the Afghan refugee community as a whole.
