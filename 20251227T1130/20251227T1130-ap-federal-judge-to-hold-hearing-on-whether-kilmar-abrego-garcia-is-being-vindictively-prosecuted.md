## Article summary
A federal judge has canceled the trial for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported, and has scheduled a hearing to determine if his prosecution for human smuggling is vindictive. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration in March but was brought back to the U.S. in June after facing public pressure, only to be issued an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges. He denies the allegations and claims prosecutors are targeting him vindictively. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr. found sufficient evidence for a hearing on this matter, scheduled for January 28, where prosecutors must explain their reasoning, or the charges could be dismissed. Abrego Garcia had previously been granted protection from deportation due to threats in his home country and has an American wife and child. Despite accusations from Trump administration members linking him to the MS-13 gang, Abrego Garcia denies this and has no criminal record. The investigation into the traffic stop that led to his arrest did not begin until after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered his return to the U.S.
