## Article summary
Jimmy Kimmel delivered an "Alternative Christmas Message" to U.K. viewers on Channel 4, using the platform to criticize U.S. President Donald Trump and warn about the rise of fascism. Kimmel remarked that it had been a "great year" for fascism, with tyranny booming. The annual alternative message tradition on Channel 4 often features personal reflections pertinent to the year's events. Kimmel's address followed a period where his show, "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," was suspended by Sinclair broadcasting group after he made comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Trump had celebrated the suspension, calling it "great news for America" and advocating for the firing of other late-night hosts. Kimmel highlighted his return to the air as a "Christmas miracle" and a victory for free speech, stating he was back to "giving the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking." He noted that silencing critics is not exclusive to authoritarian regimes. Despite historical divides, Kimmel emphasized the "special relationship" between the U.S. and U.K., urging the latter not to abandon the U.S. during its current "wobble." He described the U.S. as "tearing down the structures of our democracy" and apologized for the impact on the U.K.
