## Article summary
Online prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi, once scrutinized by the Biden administration, are now gaining traction under the Trump administration, raising concerns about election interference. During the Biden years, regulators aggressively pursued legal actions to ban these apps from allowing bets on election outcomes, leading to Polymarket ceasing U.S. operations and its CEO facing an FBI raid. However, with Trump's return to power, the landscape has shifted dramatically. Kalshi, a key competitor, is experiencing significant growth, partly due to the Trump administration's relaxed stance and the appointment of Donald Trump Jr. as a strategic adviser. Election experts warn that betting on races could undermine their integrity, yet the upcoming midterms are expected to be a lucrative period for these apps. Prediction markets operate by allowing users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events, turning various scenarios into potential wagers. While Kalshi and Polymarket claim to differ from traditional gambling by having traders bet against each other rather than a "house," a class-action lawsuit argues that their use of market makers resembles betting against the house. These platforms circumvent gambling bans by positioning themselves as selling "event contracts." Despite state-level challenges, with Massachusetts suing to push Kalshi out and other states issuing cease and desist letters, Kalshi maintains its legal arguments. Concerns also extend to potential insider trading, though the platforms state they have surveillance tools to combat it. The commodification of elections on these apps is a particular worry, as critics fear wealthy donors could manipulate odds, influencing media coverage and voter behavior. Despite Kalshi's assertion that informed traders move their markets, experts like Jeffrey Sonnenfeld warn of vulnerability to manipulation by foreign actors, citing instances where large bets on Polymarket appeared to artificially inflate a candidate's chances.
