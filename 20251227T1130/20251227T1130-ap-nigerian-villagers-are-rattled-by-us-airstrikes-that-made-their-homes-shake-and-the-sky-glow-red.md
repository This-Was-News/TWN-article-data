## Article summary
Villagers in Jabo, Nigeria, are experiencing fear and confusion following U.S. airstrikes targeting an alleged Islamic State group camp. The strikes, which occurred late Thursday night, caused homes to shake and the sky to glow red, according to residents like farmer Sanusi Madabo. The Nigerian government confirmed cooperation with the U.S. on the operation, stating that 16 precision missiles and MQ-9 Reaper drones were used. These strikes targeted staging grounds for foreign IS fighters entering Nigeria from the Sahel region. While the government did not release casualty figures for militants, residents expressed their distress and called for protection. This event marks a new phase in the conflict, following a period of diplomatic tension between Nigeria and the U.S. over accusations of Christian genocide, which Nigeria denies. Analysts suggest the strikes may have targeted the Lakurawa group, a relatively new militant entity in Nigeria, though its direct ties to IS remain unproven. The lack of transparency regarding the strikes has amplified local fears, with security forces cordoning off the affected area. The airstrikes have disrupted the lives of villagers, including a young woman whose wedding plans are now uncertain due to the perceived danger.
