## Article summary
President Trump's executive order to reclassify marijuana to Schedule III aims to ease federal restrictions, but the changes will not be immediate or all-encompassing. While the order promises relief for cannabis businesses, particularly regarding tax code Section 280E, which prohibits common business deductions, other changes will take time. Experts emphasize that the Controlled Substances Act does not grant the president unilateral authority to reschedule drugs; this typically requires a rulemaking process or an act of Congress. The administration has options to expedite the rescheduling, potentially bypassing public comment periods, though this could invite legal challenges. If successful, the tax relief could be significant, with one company estimating $38 million in potential savings for 2024 alone. Beyond taxes, the inability of cannabis businesses to accept credit cards remains a major hurdle, as most financial institutions avoid them due to liability concerns. For medical research, rescheduling is expected to ease licensing and laboratory regulations, removing the need for a Schedule I license. However, challenges in sourcing marijuana for study may persist, as federal rules on sourcing are separate from the controlled substances schedule. The full impact and timeline of these changes depend heavily on how the Justice Department implements the order and navigates potential legal obstacles.
