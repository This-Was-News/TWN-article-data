## Article summary
The decline of print newspapers, exemplified by the Montana Standard's reduced print schedule, signifies more than just a shift in news consumption habits. For many, newspapers served multiple purposes beyond information dissemination. They were physical objects used for wrapping gifts, lining pet cages, cleaning windows, and preserving personal achievements like newspaper clippings of family milestones.  The reduction in print circulation, with thousands of U.S. newspapers closing or cutting back, impacts not only the news industry but also the texture of daily life.  Publishers face high printing costs in an online society, while ordinary people lose a tangible artifact that once marked the passage of time.  This fading of the printed paper alters how people relate to news and each other, potentially reshaping attention spans and communication.  Organizations like wildlife rehabilitation centers that rely on newspapers for animal care face increased costs as print sources dwindle.  The transition from print to digital is evident globally, with former printing sites being repurposed for data centers.  While the environmental benefit of less paper is debated against the energy consumption of digital infrastructure, the loss of print newspapers represents a significant cultural and social shift.
