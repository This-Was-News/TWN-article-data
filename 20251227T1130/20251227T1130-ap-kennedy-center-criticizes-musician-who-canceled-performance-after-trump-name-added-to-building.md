## Article summary
The Kennedy Center's president, Richard Grenell, has strongly criticized musician Chuck Redd for canceling a Christmas Eve performance. Redd cited the recent addition of President Donald Trump's name to the building as the reason for his withdrawal. Grenell described Redd's decision as "classic intolerance" and a "costly political stunt," stating he would seek $1 million in damages. Redd, who has hosted holiday Jazz Jams at the center since 2006, expressed sadness over the cancellation, noting it was a popular holiday tradition. The renaming of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts to include Trump's name was approved by a Trump-appointed board. Scholars argue this violates a law that prohibits changing the center's memorial status. Kennedy's niece, Kerry Kennedy, has stated her intention to remove Trump's name after his term. Legal experts suggest any such changes would require congressional approval.
