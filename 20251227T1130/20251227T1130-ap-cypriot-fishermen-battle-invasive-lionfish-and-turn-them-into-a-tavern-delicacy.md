## Article summary
Cypriot fishermen are facing a significant challenge due to the exploding population of invasive lionfish in the Mediterranean Sea. These fish, which originated from the Red Sea, threaten to decimate local fish stocks and have already impacted the livelihoods of professional fishermen. Warmer waters, attributed to climate change, are believed to be the primary cause for the increased presence of invasive species like the lionfish and the silver-cheeked toadfish. Fishermen report a drastic decline in traditional catches, such as red mullet, and an increase in operational costs due to damaged fishing gear. To combat this issue, the European Union has implemented compensation schemes, paying fishermen to catch toadfish, which are then incinerated. Another EU-funded project utilizes scuba divers to cull lionfish in protected areas. In an effort to create a sustainable solution, a campaign is underway to promote lionfish as a tavern delicacy. Despite initial unfamiliarity among consumers, restaurants are beginning to add lionfish to their menus, offering it at a competitive price. This initiative aims to turn the environmental threat into an economic opportunity for the fishing sector.
