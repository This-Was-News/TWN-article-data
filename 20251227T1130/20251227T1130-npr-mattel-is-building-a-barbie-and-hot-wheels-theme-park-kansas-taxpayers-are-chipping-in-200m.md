## Article summary
Bonner Springs, Kansas, is providing over $200 million in tax incentives for the development of Mattel Adventure Park, a $540 million project featuring Barbie and Hot Wheels attractions. The park, slated for construction near an entertainment district and a future NFL stadium, will be funded through STAR bonds, which are repaid by sales tax revenue generated by the development. While city officials anticipate significant boosts in local tax revenues and property values, a public finance expert warns that these deals primarily divert future state revenue. The state has committed substantial funds to various STAR bond projects, raising concerns about its long-term financial sustainability. Developers estimate the park will generate $190 million annually, with construction potentially starting in 2027 and opening in 2031. The project's location is intended to preserve Bonner Springs' small-town character while benefiting from increased commercial activity. However, the increasing shift towards online shopping poses a risk to projected sales tax revenues, potentially impacting the repayment of these bonds.
