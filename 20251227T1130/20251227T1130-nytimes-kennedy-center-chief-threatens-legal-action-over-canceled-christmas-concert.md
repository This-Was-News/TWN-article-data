## Article summary
The president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Richard Grenell, is threatening legal action against musician Chuck Redd for canceling the annual Christmas Eve jazz concert. Mr. Redd canceled the concert in protest of the institution's new name, the Trump-Kennedy Center. Mr. Grenell, appointed by President Trump, accused Mr. Redd of "sad bullying tactics" and "classic intolerance," stating the center would seek $1 million in damages for the "political stunt." Mr. Redd had hosted the concert for nearly two decades. The renaming of the center, which now includes President Trump's name, was initiated by a board handpicked by Mr. Trump, a departure from the center's previous bipartisan governance. This change has also prompted a lawsuit from Representative Joyce Beatty, who argues that an act of Congress is required to alter the center's name, which was designated as a memorial to President John F. Kennedy in 1964.
