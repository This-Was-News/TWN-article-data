## Article summary
Myanmar's military rulers are holding phased general elections starting December 28, 2025, amidst a brutal civil war that erupted after the 2021 coup. The United Nations and Western governments have labeled these elections a "sham," citing the ongoing conflict, widespread human rights abuses by the military, and the suppression of dissent. The military has enacted a law against "interference" in the election process, leading to detentions for criticizing the vote. The NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi's party, is banned, and its leaders remain imprisoned. Critics believe the military aims to create a parliament dominated by its proxy party, the USDP. Neighboring China supports the elections, viewing the military as a "necessary evil" to ensure stability and protect its infrastructure projects. China has pressured ethnic armed groups to cede territory and limit arms supplies to the opposition. Factors contributing to the military's perceived advantage include the fragmentation of opposition groups, their strategic blunders, and growing fatigue among young fighters. While many Burmese desire relief from the ongoing conflict and hardship, the opposition's lack of a clear plan leaves many questioning the path to a democratic future, with some considering the military's plan for stability, however flawed, as a potential, albeit low, bar for improvement.
