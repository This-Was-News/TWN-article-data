## Article summary
Many Republican voters support President Trump's recent military action in Venezuela, viewing it as a demonstration of American strength without American casualties. For voters like Randy Dutton, the operation was "just about perfect," showcasing decisiveness and deterring adversaries. While some prominent conservative figures like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon expressed skepticism about a potential shift towards interventionism, rank-and-file Republicans largely applauded the raid. Early polls indicate strong approval, with 65 percent of Republican respondents in a Reuters/Ipsos poll approving of the operation. Many Republican voters prioritize domestic issues like the economy over foreign policy, but they perceive the Venezuela action as projecting power pragmatically. They contrast it with the Iraq War, seeing Trump's approach as more sophisticated and less ideologically driven. While some, like Donna Burgraff, express mixed feelings about the U.S. role in ousting foreign leaders, most trust Trump's "America First" approach. They believe the action was a precise strike that didn't involve occupation or direct governance, thus lightening U.S. responsibility. For these voters, the operation signifies keeping America safe and asserting influence in their hemisphere, even if some, like John Kenney, hope it doesn't become a regular occurrence.
