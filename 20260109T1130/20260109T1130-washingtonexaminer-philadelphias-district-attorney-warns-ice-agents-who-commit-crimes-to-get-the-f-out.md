## Article summary
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner issued a strong warning to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, telling them to leave the city if they intend to commit crimes. Krasner's press conference, held in response to a recent incident in Minneapolis involving an ICE agent, aimed to assert that no law enforcement officer is above the law. He vowed to prosecute any ICE agent who commits a crime in Philadelphia, ensuring they face arrest, trial, and conviction, emphasizing that a state court conviction cannot be pardoned by President Trump. Despite the incident's lack of direct connection to Philadelphia, Krasner reiterated his commitment to holding federal law enforcement accountable for any illegal actions within the city. This statement is part of Krasner's ongoing criticism of President Trump's immigration enforcement policies. He clarified that his warning is specifically for those who break the law, not for the many "honest, decent, moral law enforcement officers."
