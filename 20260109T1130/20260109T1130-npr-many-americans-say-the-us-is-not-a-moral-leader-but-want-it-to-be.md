## Article summary
A recent NPR/Ipsos poll reveals that while a majority of Americans believe the U.S. should be a moral leader on the global stage, significantly fewer think it currently holds that position compared to 2017. The poll indicates a sharp decline in the perception of America's moral leadership, with only 39% agreeing it is a moral leader today, down from 60% six years prior. Furthermore, nearly half of Americans surveyed prefer the U.S. to disengage from international affairs. The survey also highlights a partisan divide on foreign policy priorities, with Republicans leaning towards focusing on domestic enrichment and Democrats prioritizing the promotion of democracy and human rights abroad. A notable portion of Americans are uncertain about the U.S. role in defending Taiwan if China were to use military force. The poll also suggests a perception that China is gaining global influence while the U.S. is losing it, particularly in technology development. There are also significant partisan differences regarding support for Ukraine and perceptions of U.S. support for Russia. The findings reflect a complex and divided American public opinion on the nation's role and influence in the world.
