## Article summary
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents shot and injured two people in Portland, Oregon, during a traffic stop, sparking protests and calls for answers. The Department of Homeland Security stated their agent fired in self-defense after the driver attempted to run over law enforcement. However, local officials, including the Mayor and Governor, expressed skepticism about the federal narrative and demanded ICE halt operations in the city. The incident occurred the day after another shooting involving immigration agents in Minneapolis. Protests erupted outside the ICE building and City Hall, with demonstrators expressing anger and fear over federal immigration enforcement. The FBI and the Oregon Attorney General have launched investigations into the shooting. Political reactions varied, with some leaders urging calm and others criticizing the rush to judgment. The events have intensified existing tensions in Portland regarding federal immigration policies.
