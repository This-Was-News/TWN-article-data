## Article summary
Federal immigration agents shot and wounded two people in Portland, Oregon, during a vehicle stop outside a hospital. The Department of Homeland Security stated the passenger was an undocumented Venezuelan affiliated with a criminal ring and that the driver attempted to run over agents, prompting a defensive shot. This account lacks independent corroboration, and video evidence has previously cast doubt on official narratives in similar incidents. The shooting occurred amid heightened tensions between Portland and federal immigration operations, with Mayor Keith Wilson and the City Council calling for ICE to cease operations until an investigation is complete. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield vowed to investigate the incident for potential criminal charges. Local officials expressed distrust of the federal government's account and criticized the "militarization" of federal agents. Protesters gathered outside the ICE building, and Senator Jeff Merkley urged them to remain peaceful. The injured individuals were found in a residential area after the vehicle fled the scene, and one received a tourniquet application. Their conditions were not immediately known, but city officials reported they were alive.
