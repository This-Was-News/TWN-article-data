## Article summary
President Trump's recent claims about U.S. energy companies investing billions in Venezuela have caught American executives by surprise, as many are hesitant to commit significant funds to the South American country due to political uncertainty and past asset seizures. Executives from major oil firms, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, are scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House to discuss potential investments. While some smaller operators are eager to access Venezuela's vast oil reserves, larger companies have privately expressed reservations about the risks involved. Some firms are considering seeking financial guarantees from the U.S. government before committing to production in Venezuela. Despite these concerns, Chevron has maintained operations and is currently Venezuela's largest private oil producer, with its vice chairman expected at the meeting. The Trump administration has proposed a plan for the U.S. to control the sale of Venezuelan oil and its proceeds to help stabilize the country's economy. While some companies have expressed interest, making binding investment commitments remains a significant hurdle due to the long-term nature and high costs of oil projects. Shell, however, has signaled openness to a trading deal with Venezuela, and U.S. refining companies like Marathon Petroleum are poised to benefit from redirected Venezuelan oil shipments.
