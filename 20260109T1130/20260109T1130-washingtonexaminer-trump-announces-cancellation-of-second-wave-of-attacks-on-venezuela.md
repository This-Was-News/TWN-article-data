## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced the cancellation of a second wave of military strikes planned for Venezuela. This decision was communicated via his Truth Social account and appears to be a response to Venezuela's release of political prisoners. Trump cited the positive synergy between his administration and Venezuela's interim leader, Delcy Rodriguez, as a key factor. The interim government, through Jorge Rodriguez, confirmed the release of numerous political prisoners, framing it as a gesture towards national unity and peaceful coexistence. Trump expressed optimism about the ongoing collaborative efforts to rebuild Venezuela, particularly in the oil and gas infrastructure sector. He noted that oil corporations are set to invest over $100 billion in new initiatives in the country. This move follows the recent approval of Operation Absolute Resolve, which led to the capture of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro. Despite canceling the strikes, Trump stated that all ships would remain in place for safety and security purposes.
