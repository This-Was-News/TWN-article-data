## Article summary
Despite an internet and international telephone blackout, protests have spread across Iran, fueled by a call from the country's exiled crown prince. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused protesters of damaging their own streets to please U.S. President Donald Trump, who reiterated his pledge to support peaceful demonstrators and warned of consequences if they are killed. Online videos, though limited by the communications blackout, appeared to show protesters chanting against the government around bonfires in Tehran and other cities. Iranian state media alleged that "terrorist agents" of the U.S. and Israel were responsible for fires and violence, and reported casualties without elaboration. The protests, which began over Iran's struggling economy, have intensified since December 28 and represent a significant challenge to the government. Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, called for demonstrations, marking a test of his influence. Some demonstrators have chanted in support of the shah, indicating anger over the current regime. Human rights activists report at least 42 deaths and over 2,270 detentions. Pahlavi urged European leaders to join the U.S. in holding Iran's regime accountable and restoring communication. Trump suggested that Khamenei might be considering leaving Iran due to the escalating situation.
