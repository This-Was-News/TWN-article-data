## Article summary
In his final State of the State address, California Gov. Gavin Newsom positioned himself as an alternative to the "purposeful chaos" in Washington D.C., fueling speculation about a potential presidential run. Newsom highlighted California's progressive tax system and addressed issues such as lawsuits against the federal government, the state's economy, artificial intelligence, education, law enforcement, and wildfires. He also acknowledged the state's budgetary challenges, projecting an $18 billion shortfall for the 2026-27 fiscal year, but outlined plans to rebuild reserves and pay down long-term obligations. While some Democrats praised the speech for showcasing California's strength and resilience, Republicans criticized it as a campaign speech with little substance and accused Newsom of taking credit for others' actions. Notably, the fentanyl crisis was not addressed in the speech, a point of surprise for some legislators.
