## Article summary
U.S. First Assistant Attorney Bill Essayli has labeled California Governor Gavin Newsom the "king of fraud" due to alleged oversight failures in homelessness spending. Essayli stated that California has spent $24 billion over the last five years to address homelessness, but the funds' whereabouts are unaccounted for. This accusation comes in the wake of federal fraud charges filed against two real estate executives, Steven Taylor and Cody Holmes, for allegedly misusing grant money intended for homeless housing. Essayli indicated these charges are just the beginning of a broader investigation. Former President Donald Trump also criticized Newsom's administration on social media regarding fraud in California. Newsom's press office responded by calling Trump a liar and highlighting Newsom's efforts to block fraud and protect taxpayers. The White House confirmed that President Trump has directed agencies to investigate federal spending programs in California for fraud. Republican legislators in California, including State Senator Tony Strickland and Assemblymember Tom Lackey's spokesperson Izzy Swindler, have expressed support for investigations into potential waste and fraud in the state's homelessness initiatives, emphasizing the need for accountability and efficient use of taxpayer dollars.
