## Article summary
Following a fatal shooting in Minneapolis, AI-generated images of the ICE agent involved began spreading confusion online. While the agent was masked in eyewitness videos, social media posts showed an "unmasked" version, reportedly created by xAI's Grok chatbot. Experts warn that AI cannot accurately "unmask" individuals and that such enhancements can be unreliable for identification. The AI-generated image was circulated with the name Steve Grove, leading to online anger directed at two individuals named Steve Groves who were not involved in the shooting. One was a Missouri gun shop owner, and the other was the publisher of the Minnesota Star Tribune. The Star Tribune issued a statement identifying the campaign as disinformation and urging reliance on journalistic sources. The ICE agent involved has been identified as Jonathan Ross, who was previously involved in another incident where he was dragged by a car.
