## Article summary
The Senate has agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, overriding House Speaker Mike Johnson's objections. Republican Senator Thom Tillis, along with Democratic Senators Jeff Merkley and Alex Padilla, spearheaded the effort to ensure the plaque's installation after it had been missing for over three years. The Senate's action was partly motivated by a desire to counter the Trump White House's attempts to rewrite the narrative of the Jan. 6 events. Senators emphasized the importance of honesty and recognizing the bravery of law enforcement officers who protected democracy. The plaque, originally intended for the West front of the Capitol, will be prominently displayed in the Senate wing while its permanent location is finalized. This decision comes as the House, under Speaker Johnson's leadership, has questioned the plaque's compliance with the law. The resolution directs the Architect of the Capitol to find a publicly accessible location for the plaque. The issue of listing individual officer names is being addressed with a planned digital component to include the thousands of officers involved. The Senate's bipartisan commitment to historical accuracy was highlighted as a key factor in their decision.
