## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown, now in its 36th day, is severely impacting air traffic controllers who are working without pay. This has led to significant staffing shortages, causing widespread flight delays, particularly around Halloween. Controllers are calling in sick to seek other employment or due to exhaustion and frustration, with morale already low from pre-existing staffing issues and mandatory overtime. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy has warned of "mass chaos," flight cancellations, and potential airspace closures if the shutdown continues and controllers miss another paycheck. Some controllers are resorting to loans or taking on second jobs to make ends meet. They fear reaching a "tipping point" similar to a previous shutdown in 2018-2019, where controller absences caused major disruptions. Despite the FAA's efforts to manage shortages, controllers report increased risk due to fewer staff covering more duties. One controller described being the sole certified controller on a recent night shift during bad weather, highlighting the dangerous conditions. While controllers are legally prohibited from striking, they anticipate severe travel disruptions as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, with one controller predicting "the worst day of travel in the history of flight."
