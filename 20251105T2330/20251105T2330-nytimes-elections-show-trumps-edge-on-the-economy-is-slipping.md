## Article summary
Recent elections indicate a significant shift in voter sentiment, with concerns about the cost of living overshadowing the Republican Party's traditional advantage on the economy. Democratic victories in New Jersey and Virginia, along with the rise of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York City, were fueled by promises to address affordability issues and criticisms of President Trump's economic policies. Polls reveal that a majority of voters believe Trump has not met expectations on tackling inflation, and a considerable number feel his policies have worsened economic conditions. Democrats are leveraging this sentiment, with candidates like Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill winning by highlighting the economic fallout from Trump's actions. While some Republicans dismiss these off-year results as unrepresentative, strategists acknowledge the potent impact of focusing on cost and affordability. The ongoing government shutdown, linked to healthcare costs, further intensifies the affordability debate. Trump's assertions of economic strength, contrasting with voters' lived experiences of rising prices, are eroding his credibility. Although Democratic approval ratings remain low, Republicans have lost the benefit of the doubt on economic management, a stark contrast to their strong standing just two years ago. Trump's long-held reputation as an economic leader is being challenged as Democrats deliberately focus on an economic agenda.
