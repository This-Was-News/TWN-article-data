## Article summary
The Supreme Court heard arguments on the legality of the Trump administration's tariff policy, with justices appearing skeptical of the government's argument that President Trump could bypass Congress to impose tariffs using national security as justification. Both conservative and liberal justices questioned the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by the administration. Lower courts had previously ruled that Trump exceeded his statutory and constitutional authority. The president's argument was that IEEPA allows him to impose tariffs to address trade imbalances and the influx of fentanyl, which he deems national emergencies and threats to national security. The solicitor general argued these tariffs were regulatory, with revenue generation being incidental. Conversely, the challenging party's lawyer asserted that tariffs are taxes, noting the significant revenue they have generated for the federal government. Trump, a long-time proponent of tariffs, made them a key part of his re-election campaign and imposed them on various countries shortly after taking office. These tariffs caused concern among American businesses, leading to a legal challenge arguing the president overstepped his authority. A decision in this case is anticipated next year.
