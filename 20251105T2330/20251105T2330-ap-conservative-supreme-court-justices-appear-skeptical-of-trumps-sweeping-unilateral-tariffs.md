## Article summary
A majority of conservative Supreme Court justices appear skeptical of President Donald Trump's ability to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs, a key aspect of his agenda. The case, which has potentially trillion-dollar implications for the global economy, centers on whether an emergency law grants the president near-limitless power to set and change import duties, a power traditionally held by Congress. Three conservative justices, along with the court's three liberal justices, raised questions about the broad scope of Trump's actions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Justices Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Amy Coney Barrett expressed concerns about the executive branch accumulating too much power and the wide-ranging nature of the tariffs imposed on numerous countries. The Trump administration argued that the tariffs are primarily about regulating foreign commerce for fairness, with revenue generation being incidental, while Trump himself stated they would help slash the deficit. Challengers contend that the tariffs function as a domestic tax and that siding with Trump would permanently cede tariff control from Congress to the president. The arguments also touched upon the major questions doctrine, which has previously limited executive actions. While a ruling against Trump could complicate the recovery of billions collected in tariffs, he could still impose tariffs under other, more limited laws. The Supreme Court's decision, expected in weeks or months, represents a significant legal test for Trump's presidency.
