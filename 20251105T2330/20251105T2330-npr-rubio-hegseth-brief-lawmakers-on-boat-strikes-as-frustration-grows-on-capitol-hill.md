## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth briefed top congressional members on Wednesday regarding President Trump's recent U.S. military strikes against alleged drug boats. These strikes, which have resulted in at least 66 deaths in 16 incidents since September, have raised concerns and frustration on Capitol Hill. Legal analysts have widely described the strikes as potentially illegal under both U.S. and international law, particularly due to a lack of congressional authorization. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has been demanding more information about the attacks, with some criticizing the administration's transparency and the limited scope of previous briefings, which were often exclusive to Republicans. Senator Mark Warner criticized the administration's actions as "corrosive" to democracy and dangerous for national security. Wednesday's closed-door meeting was the first time Rubio and Hegseth briefed key lawmakers on the strikes since their commencement. Lawmakers have expressed concerns about the legal basis for Trump's orders, access to target lists, and information on those killed. A bipartisan group of senators, including Tim Kaine, Rand Paul, and Adam Schiff, have introduced a war powers resolution to block Trump's use of military forces against Venezuela, asserting that only Congress has the authority to declare war. This follows an earlier failed vote to limit strikes in the Caribbean, though proponents believe the new resolution has a stronger chance of passage.
