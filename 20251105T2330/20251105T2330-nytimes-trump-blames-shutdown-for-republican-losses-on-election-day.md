## Article summary
President Trump attributed the Republican party's losses in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections to the ongoing government shutdown. Speaking to Senate Republicans, he cited pollsters who suggested the shutdown was a significant negative factor for his party. Mr. Trump also indicated that voters turn out more for him personally than for other Republican candidates, as he was not on the ballot. In Miami, he criticized Democrats for electing a "communist" mayor in New York City, framing the victory as a warning to the nation and endorsing the opponent of the elected official. He suggested the choice facing Americans was between "communism and common sense." The article notes that recent polling indicated weakening support for Mr. Trump's agenda and a belief among voters that the country was on the wrong path. Mr. Trump expressed frustration that Democrats were not receiving more blame for initiating the shutdown. While acknowledging the election results were not positive for Republicans, he stated they were in heavily Democratic areas. Speaker Mike Johnson echoed this sentiment, suggesting the defeats were not a repudiation of the Republican party but a reflection of voter frustration.
