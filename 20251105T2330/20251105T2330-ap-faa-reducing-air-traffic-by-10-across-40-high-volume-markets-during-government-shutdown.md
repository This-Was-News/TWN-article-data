## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is reducing air traffic by 10% across 40 high-volume markets starting Friday to ensure safety during the government shutdown. This measure will affect thousands of flights daily as air traffic controllers have been working without pay since October 1st. Staffing shortages have already led to flight delays at several U.S. airports. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford stated the agency is taking proactive steps to avoid a crisis, citing growing staffing pressures. The FAA will meet with airline executives to implement the flight reduction, with a list of affected markets to be released on Thursday. Southwest Airlines is evaluating potential schedule impacts and urging Congress to resolve the shutdown. The FAA has previously reduced flights due to weather or staffing issues, but the current situation has seen a significant increase in reported staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities. Most controllers are working mandatory overtime, limiting their ability to supplement their income. Aviation groups are urging an end to the shutdown, with concerns about potential chaos in the skies if controllers miss a second paycheck. The FAA aims to assess pressure and act before adverse consequences occur, drawing lessons from past incidents.
