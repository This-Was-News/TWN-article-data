## Article summary
Democratic victories in recent elections have strengthened their resolve to continue the government shutdown fight, temporarily halting bipartisan negotiations. Senate Democrats are insisting that President Trump negotiate on healthcare subsidies to end the standoff. Some centrist Democrats had previously shown willingness to compromise due to the shutdown's widespread impact on federal workers, nutrition benefits, and air travel. However, President Trump's acknowledgment that the shutdown negatively affected Republicans appears to have complicated efforts to find a resolution. He stated at a breakfast with Republican senators that the shutdown was a significant factor against the party and that the government must reopen soon. Despite this, a group of Democratic moderates has been privately discussing spending legislation with centrist Republicans.
