## Article summary
President Trump has authorized the deployment of National Guard members to Chicago and Portland, despite opposition from Democratic governors. In Chicago, 300 Illinois National Guard members will be sent to protect federal property and personnel, while in Oregon, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the Oregon National Guard, but troops from California have arrived. The deployments are part of Trump's plan to address crime and protect federal law enforcement in Democratic-run cities. Governors of Oregon and Illinois have expressed their disapproval, stating that the deployments are unnecessary and will escalate tensions. Meanwhile, a woman was shot by Border Patrol agents in Chicago during a confrontation, and the Trump administration continues to face legal challenges over its use of federal forces in response to protests.
