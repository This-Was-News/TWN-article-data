## Article summary
Federal immigration agents in Chicago have been using aggressive tactics, including helicopters, chemical agents, and door breaches, to arrest over 1,000 immigrants. These actions have sparked tensions and fear among residents, with reports of U.S. citizens and children being detained. Activists and local leaders have condemned the tactics, with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker calling them military-style and inappropriate for children. The operations have targeted immigrant-heavy neighborhoods, including a recent raid in the South Shore area. Residents reported doors being knocked off hinges and individuals, including children, being zip-tied. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claims to be targeting gang members and criminals, but details on arrests and treatment of detainees are scarce. The use of chemical agents has increased, affecting schools and hospitals. Local officials and activists have filed lawsuits and demanded investigations into the agents' actions. The aggressive tactics have led to protests and calls for an end to the raids, with some comparing the agents' behavior to an invading army.
