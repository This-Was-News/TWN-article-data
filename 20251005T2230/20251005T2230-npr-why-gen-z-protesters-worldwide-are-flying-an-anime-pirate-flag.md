## Article summary
Gen Z-led protests worldwide are using the Straw Hat Pirates' Jolly Roger flag from the anime *One Piece* as a symbol of rebellion against oppressive systems. The flag, featuring a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat, has been seen in protests in Nepal, Indonesia, the Philippines, Madagascar, and Morocco. The *One Piece* anime, about a group of pirates fighting an oppressive government, resonates with young protesters who feel unheard and trapped in unfair systems. The flag's appearance in protests has sparked discussions about its significance and the power of pop culture symbols in social movements. In Madagascar, protesters have adapted the flag to include a local *satroka* bucket hat. Despite concerns about confusion, experts argue that the flag's common narrative of rebellion against authority unites protesters globally. Some governments, like Indonesia, have tried to suppress the flag's use, but organizations like Amnesty International have defended protesters' rights to free expression. The *One Piece* flag is one of many pop culture symbols used in protests, including Pepe the Frog, the three-finger salute from *The Hunger Games*, and the Guy Fawkes mask from *V for Vendetta*. The flag's popularity among Gen Z protesters highlights its ability to quickly convey a message of resistance and solidarity.
