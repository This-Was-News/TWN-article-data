## Article summary
The article discusses the dangerous trend of 'subway surfing' in New York City, where individuals, often young boys, climb onto the roofs of moving subway trains, leading to numerous deaths and injuries. The practice, fueled by social media, has resulted in over a dozen fatalities in recent years. Authorities have implemented public awareness campaigns and deployed drones to catch thrill-seekers, but the root cause of why kids can access the roofs of trains remains unaddressed. Experts suggest making trains harder to climb and using technology like cameras and sensors to detect surfers. The MTA is studying the issue but has not yet implemented broad solutions. Some propose locking the doors between subway cars to prevent access, though this raises concerns about emergency evacuations. The MTA has also requested social media companies to remove videos glamorizing subway surfing and has launched campaigns to educate the public about the dangers. Despite these efforts, subway surfing continues to be a significant problem, with arrests and deaths rising in recent years.
