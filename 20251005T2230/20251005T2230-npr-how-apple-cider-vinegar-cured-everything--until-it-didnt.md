## Article summary
The BMJ Group has retracted a study that claimed apple cider vinegar could aid significant weight loss, citing concerns about the study's quality. The study, published in March 2024, involved 120 overweight or obese individuals in Lebanon and reported a 9% body mass reduction. Nutrition experts, including Marion Nestle from NYU, had long questioned the health claims of apple cider vinegar. Scientists like Eric Trexler from Duke University pointed out flaws in the study shortly after its publication, noting the implausible weight loss results. The delay in retraction highlights the need for reform in academic publishing. Despite scientific pushback, apple cider vinegar remains popular, endorsed by celebrities like Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian. Academic institutions such as Harvard Medical School and the Mayo Clinic have debunked its purported health benefits. A Netflix series based on influencer Belle Gibson's fraudulent claims about curing cancer with natural remedies has also tarnished the product's reputation. Despite these setbacks, the global market for apple cider vinegar is expected to grow through 2032. Bragg Live Food Products, which markets the vinegar, downplayed the retraction, stating they did not rely on the study for their claims.
