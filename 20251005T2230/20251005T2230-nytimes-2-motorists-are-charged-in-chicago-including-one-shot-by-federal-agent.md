## Article summary
Two Chicago residents, Marimar Martinez and Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, have been charged with using their cars to assault federal agents. The incident occurred on Saturday morning on the Southwest Side of Chicago, resulting in a federal agent shooting Martinez. The criminal complaint states that Martinez and Ruiz pursued Border Patrol agents, running red lights and stop signs, and eventually rammed one of the agents' cars. Martinez drove her car directly at an agent, prompting him to fire five shots. The complaint contradicts an earlier Department of Homeland Security statement that claimed the motorists were armed with a semiautomatic weapon. Martinez's lawyer is working to gather information and secure her release, while Ruiz's mother disputes the official account, claiming her son was struck by agents and that other cars were involved in the confrontation.
