## Article summary
The Trump administration sent 300 federalized California National Guard members to Oregon, bypassing a federal court order that blocked the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the move as an abuse of power and announced plans to sue. The deployment followed protests at an ICE facility in Portland, which a judge deemed not significantly violent. The White House defended the action as necessary to protect federal assets. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Mayor Keith Wilson, expressed outrage, stating there was no need for military intervention. The president has previously deployed National Guard troops to other Democratic-led cities, citing crime and immigration enforcement. A federal judge had ruled that the use of troops in California was illegal, but the ruling is under appeal. Legal experts argue that the deployment to Oregon is likely unlawful. Despite the administration's claims, Portland has seen a decrease in protest intensity, with residents and tourists enjoying normal activities. Tensions have been heightened by outside protesters and increased use of force by federal agents.
