## Article summary
President Trump urged Hamas to swiftly act on a peace plan to end the two-year conflict in Gaza, warning against delays. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the return of all hostages by October 13. Despite a reduction in Israeli strikes, casualties were reported in Gaza City. A 20-point peace plan, agreed to by Hamas, includes the immediate release of hostages. Trump demanded Israel halt bombing to facilitate this. Netanyahu acknowledged the commitment to end the war, with Israeli forces reducing activity to a minimum. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will lead negotiations in Egypt, focusing on Israeli withdrawal, aid, and prisoner exchanges. Hamas seeks approval from other Palestinian factions for the talks. Protests across Europe demand an end to the war, with the Palestinian death toll exceeding 67,000. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid supports Trump's proposal, while hostage families see increased hope for their loved ones' return.
