## Article summary
Hundreds of thousands of people marched across several European cities in support of Palestinians and an aid flotilla's attempt to reach Gaza. The largest demonstration was held in Istanbul, where crowds marched from the Hagia Sophia to the Golden Horn, calling for Muslim solidarity with Palestinians. Protests were also planned in other European cities to mark the second anniversary of Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. In Turkey, protesters condemned the genocide in Gaza, with support widespread among the Muslim-majority population. In the Netherlands, an estimated 250,000 people gathered in Amsterdam to press the government to take tougher action against Israel. The Dutch government has been a staunch supporter of Israel but has recently been more critical. In Britain, hundreds of people rallied to mourn the victims of an attack on a synagogue in Manchester. Paris saw support for hostages held by Hamas, while in Bulgaria, demonstrators marched with signs condemning the situation in Gaza. Moroccans protested in Rabat, demanding the release of flotilla activists. Smaller marches were held in Spain, calling for an end to genocide and trade relations with Israel. Hamas has accepted some elements of a plan laid out by U.S. President Donald Trump to end the war, which has left Gaza's largest city in famine and stirred accusations of genocide against Israel.
