## Article summary
The Supreme Court's new term begins with significant cases on presidential power, voting rights, and LGBTQ rights. The conservative majority has generally supported President Trump's aggressive assertions of authority, as seen in preliminary rulings. Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson criticized one decision, comparing it to the unpredictable game Calvinball. Key cases include Trump's imposition of tariffs, his power to fire independent agency members, and an executive order denying birthright citizenship to children of undocumented parents. The court will also address voting rights in Louisiana, potentially impacting the Voting Rights Act. Additionally, the justices will consider limits on political party spending and laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports. The court's conservative majority has been skeptical of race considerations in public life and has struck down several campaign finance regulations. The future of transgender rights and the composition of the court itself, with Justice Alito potentially retiring, are also under scrutiny.
