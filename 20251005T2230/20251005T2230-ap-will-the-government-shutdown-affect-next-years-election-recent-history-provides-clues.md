## Article summary
Political leaders in Washington are blaming each other for a potential extended government shutdown, with both parties using the situation to shape the narrative for next year's elections. Democrats have launched digital ads accusing Republicans of obstructing affordable health care, while Republicans are blaming Democrats for threatening a shutdown to stop President Trump's policies. Recent history shows that the impact of government shutdowns on elections is often minimal, as seen in the 2013 and 2018-2019 shutdowns. Despite the shutdowns, Republicans gained seats in subsequent elections, suggesting that voters may not hold shutdowns against politicians in the long term. Both parties are using the shutdown to emphasize key issues for the midterms, with Democrats focusing on health care affordability and Republicans pivoting to immigration. The relatively small ad buys indicate that both parties are eyeing bigger fights ahead. Democrats are concerned about rising health care costs and the potential loss of coverage due to Republican policies, while Republicans are using the shutdown to highlight immigration issues. The current shutdown is different from previous ones, as Democratic lawmakers are seeking policy changes to keep the government open. Republicans argue that the shutdown is wasteful and unnecessary, blaming Democrats for the potential harm to working families.
