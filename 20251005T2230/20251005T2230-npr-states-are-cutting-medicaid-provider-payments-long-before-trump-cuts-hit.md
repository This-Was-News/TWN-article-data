## Article summary
States are reducing Medicaid provider payments, impacting healthcare access. North Carolina's Medicaid cuts, effective October 1, include a 3% pay reduction for providers, with primary care doctors facing an 8% cut and specialty doctors a 10% drop. These cuts are expected to reduce the number of providers accepting Medicaid, leading to worse outcomes and higher downstream costs. Nationwide, states are cutting Medicaid to address budget shortfalls, with Idaho implementing a 4% across-the-board cut. These reductions are causing backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups, as well as financial strain on small hospitals. Medicaid makes up a significant portion of state spending, and recent cuts are exacerbating access issues for vulnerable populations. In North Carolina, caregivers like Alessandra Fabrello are facing pay cuts, making it harder to provide necessary care for their children. The cuts are also affecting dental and other medical services, further limiting access to care. Despite the challenges, some states are exploring ways to reinstate funding or mitigate the impact of these cuts.
