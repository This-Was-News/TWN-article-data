## Article summary
The article discusses the historical parallels between ancient comedians who faced severe consequences for criticizing leaders and modern late-night comedians like Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, who have also faced backlash. In ancient Athens, comedians enjoyed freedom of speech, but this changed as the political system became more autocratic. The article highlights the fates of ancient comedians such as Sotades and Theocritus, who were punished or executed for their jokes. It also mentions Marcus Tullius Cicero, who was killed for his speeches against Marc Antony. The article draws a comparison to President Trump's reactions to modern comedians, noting that while Kimmel was temporarily removed from the air, the situation echoes the historical crackdowns on free speech. Scholars emphasize the importance of understanding these historical lessons, as the founders of the United States were influenced by ancient writings and the idea that democracies should tolerate criticism and humor.
