## Article summary
A statue depicting President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands was briefly displayed near the U.S. Capitol before being removed. The statue, titled *Best Friends Forever*, was installed by a group called The Secret Handshake to mark Friendship Month, despite Trump's repeated attempts to distance himself from Epstein. The group claimed the statue was removed illegally by the Trump administration, which denied the allegations. The statue's plaque referenced a birthday note Trump allegedly wrote for Epstein, which Trump has dismissed as fake. This is one of several anti-Trump sculptures installed by The Secret Handshake on the National Mall, including pieces criticizing Trump's actions and associations. Other statues have included a satirical depiction of Nancy Pelosi's desk with feces, a tiki torch monument referencing the Charlottesville rally, and a golden thumbs-up crushing the Statue of Liberty. Each installation has sparked controversy and debate, with the group maintaining that their art is protected speech.
