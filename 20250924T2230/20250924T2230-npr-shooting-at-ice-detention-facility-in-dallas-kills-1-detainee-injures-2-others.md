## Article summary
A shooting occurred at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Dallas, Texas, resulting in one detainee killed and two others wounded. Federal authorities described the incident as an 'act of targeted violence' and 'an attack' against ICE. The gunman fired indiscriminately at the building and a van in the sallyport, with one of the wounded being a Mexican national. The suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators found bullet casings with the words 'ANTI ICE' engraved on them, suggesting the shooter's motive. President Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the violence, with Trump blaming 'Deranged Radical Leftists' for the rhetoric against ICE. Texas Gov. Abbott affirmed that the attack would not deter the state's strict immigration policies. A migrant inside the facility during the shooting recounted the terrifying experience, highlighting the fear and insecurity felt by immigrants. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson urged patience and calm as the investigation continues, while officials like Sen. Ted Cruz called for an end to politically motivated violence.
