## Article summary
Ameya Desai, a returning champion of NPR's Student Podcast Challenge, interviewed 85-year-old Linda Horikawa, a survivor of Japanese incarceration camps, for her winning middle school entry. Horikawa, initially hesitant, shared her experiences of being forcibly relocated from her family's berry ranch in Cupertino, California, to the Heart Mountain incarceration camp in Wyoming during World War II. She described the harsh conditions, including shared living spaces and communal bathrooms, and the prejudice they faced upon returning to California. Ameya's podcast, 'Far From Home - Shikata Ga Nai,' explores this history, which Horikawa had kept largely private. The podcast was praised for its care, curiosity, and the emotional depth of Horikawa's story. Horikawa, a former kindergarten teacher, found a friend in Ameya and hopes the story will help prevent similar injustices in the future. This is Ameya's second win in the challenge, following her fourth-grade victory for a podcast about her grandfather's forced migration from India to Uganda to the United States.
