## Article summary
At a U.N. climate summit, most countries pledged to accelerate efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, while the U.S. stood out for its absence. Major nations like China, Russia, Japan, and Germany, along with small island states and the world's poorest countries, participated. The U.S., under President Trump, has been diplomatically isolated on climate change, opposing renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. Trump's administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement and removed incentives for renewable energy projects. Despite this, other countries, including China and the European Union, are pushing forward with ambitious climate goals. China pledged significant reductions in emissions and increases in renewable energy capacity by 2035. The European Union aims to cut emissions by 66% to 72% by 2035 but faces challenges due to trade negotiations with the U.S. The summit highlighted the global shift towards renewable energy, with many countries seeing it as both economically beneficial and crucial for energy security.
