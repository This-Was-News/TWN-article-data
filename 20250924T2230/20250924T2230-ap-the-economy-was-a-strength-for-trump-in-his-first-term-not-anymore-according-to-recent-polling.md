## Article summary
Recent polling indicates a shift in President Donald Trump's strongest issues in his second term. While the economy was a significant strength in his first term, his approval on economic issues is now relatively low, particularly among independents. Instead, Trump's strongest issues are border security and crime, with a majority of U.S. adults approving of his approach to border security. His approval on immigration has slightly decreased but remains higher than his overall job approval. Concerns about crime show potential weakness, with his approval on this issue slightly down from its peak in August. The economy remains a weak point, with only 37% approving of Trump's handling of it, and even lower approval among independents. Trade negotiations and health care also have low approval ratings, both among the general public and Republicans. On foreign policy, Trump's approval has been steady, but his handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has seen a slight decline. Overall, Trump's job approval has been fairly steady since the beginning of his second term, with 39% of U.S. adults approving of his performance.
