## Article summary
President Donald Trump's administration surprised many experts, including Dr. Richard Frye, by approving an unproven autism drug without extensive research. The drug, leucovorin, a derivative of vitamin B, was suggested by Frye but lacked substantial evidence for its effectiveness in treating autism. Leading autism groups and researchers criticized the decision, stating that the supporting studies were weak and small. While some doctors are prescribing the drug, experts caution that it should only be used in controlled clinical trials. The drug's potential benefits are linked to folate deficiencies in the brain, but the evidence remains inconclusive. Frye, who struggled to secure traditional funding, formed the Autism Discovery Coalition to promote his research. The FDA's announcement may have derailed plans for a new, patented version of the drug, opting instead to update the label on the generic version. Specialists warn about the risks of experimental treatments and the need for rigorous testing. Meanwhile, parents like Brian Noonan have reported improvements in their children after using the drug, but experts emphasize the importance of caution and further study.
