## Article summary
President Donald Trump, in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly, claimed to have ended seven conflicts in seven months, a statement frequently made but not entirely accurate. Trump is credited with helping to end a 12-day war between Israel and Iran, where he negotiated a ceasefire after directing strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts agree the U.S. played a role but note the ceasefire is temporary. Regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam dispute, Trump tried to broker a deal but failed, and the issue remains unresolved. In Kashmir, a ceasefire was reached after a tourist killing, though India denies Trump's role in the negotiations. Trump also facilitated a deal between Serbia and Kosovo, but much of it was not implemented. In Eastern Congo, a peace deal was signed between Congo and Rwanda, but the M23 rebel group was not involved. Trump hosted Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders to sign a deal aimed at ending their decades-long conflict, though the treaty has not been ratified. Additionally, Trump pushed Thailand and Cambodia to agree to a ceasefire in their border conflict, using trade agreements as leverage.
