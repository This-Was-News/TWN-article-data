## Article summary
China, the world's largest carbon polluter, pledged at the United Nations to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7% to 10% over the next decade, marking a significant commitment to combating global warming. This announcement came amidst a U.N. climate summit where most nations, except the United States, gathered to discuss emissions reduction strategies. President Xi Jinping of China emphasized the importance of a green and low-carbon transition, indirectly criticizing the U.S. for its stance on climate change. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for increased military aid to counter Russian aggression, highlighting the rapid advancements in military technology and the need for international regulation of artificial intelligence. The U.N. Security Council held its first open debate on A.I., expressing concerns about its potential threats to global stability and peace. Additionally, Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, addressed the U.N. General Assembly for the first time in nearly 60 years, outlining efforts to rebuild the country and calling for an end to economic sanctions. The summit also saw discussions on nuclear negotiations with Iran, the restoration of diplomatic ties between Ukraine and Syria, and the geopolitical tensions involving the United States, China, and Russia.
