## Article summary
President Trump displayed contrasting tones at the United Nations, being bellicose in public and conciliatory in private. He criticized the U.N. in his speech but praised it in a meeting with the secretary-general. World leaders have learned to navigate two versions of Trump: a public, aggressive figure and a private, accommodating one. Diplomats have adopted a strategy of flattery to avoid his wrath. Despite his public criticism, European leaders praised Trump and sought one-on-one meetings. The U.N. leader praised Trump's peace efforts, and Trump expressed support for the organization despite cutting its funding. European leaders successfully persuaded Trump to change his stance on Ukraine. Trump's dual nature was evident in his interactions with various leaders, including Brazil's president, whom he publicly criticized but privately embraced. Former Vice President Kamala Harris also noted this duality in her book.
