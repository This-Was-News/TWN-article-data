## Article summary
President Donald Trump has transformed the Rose Garden at the White House into an exclusive hangout called the Rose Garden Club, featuring a stone patio, food from the White House kitchen, and a playlist curated by Trump. The club is reserved for political allies, business executives, and administration officials. The renovation, costing about $2 million, was funded by private donations and mimics the ambiance of Trump's private Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. The club's debut event was initially planned for tech executives but was moved indoors due to rain, with Republican lawmakers becoming the first guests. The events are part of the tradition of presidential entertaining, with some costs covered by taxpayers. Trump, known for his hospitality, enjoys hosting influential figures and has been spending more time at the Rose Garden Club than at his New Jersey golf course. The club's official debut featured a formal dinner with steak, chicken, or pasta, and chocolate cake for dessert. The transformation of the Rose Garden into a private club highlights Trump's unique approach to blending his personal style with presidential duties.
