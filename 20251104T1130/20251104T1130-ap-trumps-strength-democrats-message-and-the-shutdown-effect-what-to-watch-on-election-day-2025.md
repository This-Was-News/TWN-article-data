## Article summary
Election Day 2025 presents a crucial test for both Donald Trump's influence and the Democratic Party's messaging, with key gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey serving as bellwethers. Despite Trump's absence from the campaign trail, his policies and leadership are central to the Republican candidates' strategies, who have closely aligned themselves with him. Democrats are navigating different philosophical approaches, from moderate stances to embracing progressive policies, with outcomes in races like the New York City mayoral election potentially highlighting rising stars. The ongoing federal government shutdown, impacting federal workers and critical programs, adds another layer of urgency for voters. In Pennsylvania, a state Supreme Court election could shape the balance of power in a key swing state, while California's Proposition 50 offers a chance to redraw congressional maps. The election is also a test for Democratic candidates like Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, who are focusing on economic issues and public safety, distancing themselves from more progressive elements of the party. The results will offer insights into the electorate's mood heading into the next midterm elections. The impact of Trump's coalition, particularly lower-propensity voters, in non-presidential years remains a significant question. Former President Barack Obama's campaigning for Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia adds another dimension to the electoral landscape.
