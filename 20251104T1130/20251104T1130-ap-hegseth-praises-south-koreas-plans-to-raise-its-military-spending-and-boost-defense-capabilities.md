## Article summary
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lauded South Korea's commitment to increase military spending and bolster its defense capabilities, signaling a larger role for the ally in deterring North Korean aggression. This move aligns with U.S. desires for South Korea to enhance its conventional defense, allowing Washington to focus more on China. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung is seeking an 8.2% defense spending increase to modernize weapons and reduce reliance on the U.S. Hegseth emphasized the strengthening alliance, highlighting cooperation in warship maintenance as an example of leveraging South Korea's shipbuilding prowess. While the alliance primarily addresses North Korean threats, it also considers broader regional security concerns. South Korea reaffirmed its commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, denying speculation about pursuing its own nuclear program or redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear weapons. The two nations are working on a framework integrating U.S. nuclear capabilities with South Korea's conventional weapons. President Lee also supported the transfer of wartime operational control of allied forces to a South Korean-led command, viewing it as a matter of national sovereignty. This discussion occurred amidst North Korea's recent artillery tests toward its western waters, shortly before Hegseth's arrival.
