## Article summary
New Yorkers are heading to the polls today to elect their next mayor in one of the city's most closely watched elections in years. The race features three main contenders: Zohran Mamdani, the incumbent assemblyman and Democratic nominee; Andrew M. Cuomo, the former governor running independently; and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican founder of the Guardian Angels. Throughout the campaign, Mamdani has consistently led in the polls, followed by Cuomo and then Sliwa. Today's vote will determine if this order holds or if there's an upset. Voter turnout is expected to be high, with early voting numbers significantly exceeding those of the 2021 election. The final day of campaigning saw notable events, including President Trump's endorsement of Cuomo and threats to withhold federal funds if Mamdani wins. Mamdani's campaign faced questions regarding his stance on ballot proposals, with his team stating he would reveal his position when voting. Sliwa visited a subway station to pay respects to a victim of a recent crime. Mamdani and Cuomo are expected to cast their ballots this morning, while Sliwa voted early. All three candidates will conclude their election day with watch parties.
