## Article summary
The Trump administration announced it will partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for November, following court orders to continue the program during the federal government shutdown. The USDA had planned to freeze payments starting November 1st due to the shutdown, impacting approximately 1 in 8 Americans. An emergency fund with $4.65 billion will be used, covering about half of the normal benefits, potentially setting a precedent for December if the shutdown persists. Beneficiaries may receive reduced amounts, and the timing of these payments is uncertain, with some states warning of delays. State officials criticized the decision, stating the administration has the means to fully fund the program. Additionally, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) received an extra $450 million in funding. Recipients like Corina Betancourt and Jamal Brown are already facing difficulties and are concerned about stretching their reduced benefits. Legal action is being considered to compel full SNAP funding, with Democratic leaders urging the government to act. Most states are increasing aid to food banks and exploring ways to reload SNAP cards with state funds. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that the government must use an emergency fund to partially pay for SNAP. The USDA opted not to use other emergency funds to avoid impacting child nutrition programs through fiscal year 2026.
