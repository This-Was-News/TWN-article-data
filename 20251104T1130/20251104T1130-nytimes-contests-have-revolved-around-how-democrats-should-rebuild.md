## Article summary
The first major elections since President Trump's second term began are taking place today, serving as an early gauge of his administration's impact and the Democratic Party's direction. Key races include the New York City mayoral election, where Zohran Mamdani's performance will indicate the appetite for progressive politics. Gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia are framed as referendums on Trump, continuing a trend of voters in these states opposing the party in power in Washington. California's redistricting ballot measure is being watched to see if other blue states will follow suit in redrawing congressional maps. Concerns about potential federal intervention at polling sites have been raised, with the Justice Department planning to send monitors to California and New Jersey. The balance of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is also at stake in retention elections that could impact future election litigation. Additionally, mayoral races in cities like Minneapolis and Seattle will test the strength of progressive challenges against mainstream Democratic incumbents, offering insights into the mood of urban liberal voters nationwide.
