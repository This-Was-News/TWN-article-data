## Article summary
President Donald Trump has endorsed Andrew Cuomo for New York City mayor, warning that a victory for Zohran Mamdani would result in a significant reduction of federal funds to the city. Trump described Mamdani as a "Communist with no experience" and a "Record of COMPLETE AND TOTAL FAILURE," urging voters to support Cuomo despite any personal reservations. He also suggested that a vote for Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa would effectively be a vote for Mamdani. This intervention comes just before the election, with Cuomo running as an independent and appealing to moderate and right-leaning voters. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, responded by framing Trump's endorsement as an attempt by wealthy interests to influence the election and a choice between democracy and oligarchy.
