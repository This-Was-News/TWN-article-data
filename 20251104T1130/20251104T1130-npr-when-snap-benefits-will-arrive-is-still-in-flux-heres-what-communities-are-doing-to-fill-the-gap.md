## Article summary
The Trump administration's decision to restart the SNAP program with only half the usual amount has created widespread concern and prompted various community responses. With the federal government shutdown in its 35th day, the USDA has frozen SNAP funding, leaving millions of low-income families uncertain about when they will receive benefits. Two federal judges have ordered the administration to use emergency funding, but delays are still anticipated. Food banks across the country are experiencing a surge in demand, with some warning of a potential public health crisis. Small grocery stores and local farmers are also bracing for financial impacts. In response, some communities have established informal systems to support neighbors in need, collaborating with food banks and government officials. Senior citizens may be disproportionately affected by this unprecedented national food crisis. States are implementing various measures, from allocating state funds to food banks to declaring states of emergency, as they try to mitigate the impact of the SNAP benefit disruption. This situation highlights the critical role SNAP plays in the nation's food security and the challenges faced by those who rely on it.
