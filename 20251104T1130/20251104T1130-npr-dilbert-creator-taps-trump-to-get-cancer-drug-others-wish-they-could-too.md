## Article summary
Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, who has metastatic prostate cancer, publicly appealed to former President Donald Trump for help with a health insurance issue. Adams posted on X that his insurer, Kaiser of Northern California, had failed to schedule a necessary procedure for his cancer treatment. He stated he was declining rapidly and would ask Trump to intervene. Donald Trump Jr. and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded, with Kennedy indicating that President Trump wanted to help. Subsequently, Trump posted on Truth Social, "On it!" The following day, Adams announced he had secured an appointment for his cancer drug infusion. Adams noted that while he waited months for the drug like others, his "glitch" seemed to be corrected. This incident highlights the complexities and frustrations many Americans face with the U.S. healthcare system, where access to care can be difficult. Health care advocates pointed out that while Adams received help, ordinary citizens often lack the connections for such swift resolution. They emphasized that the system should not require presidential intervention for high-profile individuals, and that such assistance should be universally available. The situation also brings attention to ongoing political debates about healthcare access and affordability, particularly concerning ACA tax credits.
