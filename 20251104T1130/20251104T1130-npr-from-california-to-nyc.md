## Article summary
This Election Day features several key races, including a special election in California concerning redistricting. Proposition 50 aims to replace current congressional lines with a map favoring Democrats, potentially helping them win more House seats in future elections. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is the frontrunner for mayor, having defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the primary. Mamdani's victory has energized parts of the Democratic base, though Cuomo is running as an independent. New Jersey's gubernatorial race is a tight contest between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, with Trump actively campaigning for Ciattarelli. Sherrill, endorsed by former President Obama, holds a slight polling edge. This election could mark the first time in decades New Jersey elects a governor from the same party for three consecutive terms. Virginia's gubernatorial race pits Democrat Abigail Spanberger against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Spanberger focuses on the cost of living and federal workforce cuts, while Earle-Sears emphasizes crime reduction, lower taxes, and social issues. Both candidates would make history as Virginia's first female governor, with Earle-Sears potentially being the first Black woman elected governor in the U.S. The outcome in Virginia could be influenced by the historical trend of the party in power in the White House losing the governor's race.
