The 2025 Booker Prize shortlist features six accomplished authors, each recognized for their mastery of the English language and storytelling. The shortlisted works include Susan Choi's sixth novel, Flashlight, which began as a short story; Kiran Desai's The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, with Desai being a previous Booker winner; Katie Kitamura's Audition, inspired by a unique idea; Ben Markovits' The Rest of Our Lives, a road trip novel about family life; Andrew Miller's tenth novel, The Land in Winter, set during the U.K.'s Big Freeze; and David Szalay's Flesh, a coming-of-age story set in Hungary. Each shortlisted author receives £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. The winner, who will receive £50,000, will be announced on November 10, with the ceremony broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and livestreamed on the Booker Prizes' social channels. The judges, chaired by Roddy Doyle, praised the shortlisted authors for their command of language and expertise.
