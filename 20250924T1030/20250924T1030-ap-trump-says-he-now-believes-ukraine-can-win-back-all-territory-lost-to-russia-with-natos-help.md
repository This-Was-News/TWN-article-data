## Article summary
President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine could reclaim all territory lost to Russia with NATO's support, marking a shift from his previous calls for Ukrainian concessions. This change was announced after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations General Assembly. Trump emphasized that Ukraine, with EU and NATO backing, could restore its original borders. Zelenskyy welcomed this support, which aligns with Ukraine's stance. Trump also criticized Russia's prolonged war efforts and urged Europe to halt Russian energy imports. Despite previous diplomatic efforts, including a summit with Putin, progress has stalled. Both Trump and Zelenskyy agreed on the need for stronger sanctions against Russia. The war has caused significant civilian casualties and human rights abuses, as highlighted by a recent U.N. report. NATO allies are also addressing Russian airspace violations, with Trump pledging support for affected countries.
