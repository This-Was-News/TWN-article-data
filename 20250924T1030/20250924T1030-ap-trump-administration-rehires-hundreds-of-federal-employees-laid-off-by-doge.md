## Article summary
The Trump administration is rehiring hundreds of federal employees who were laid off during Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiatives. The General Services Administration (GSA) has asked these employees to return to work by October 6, after a seven-month paid leave. The GSA, which manages federal workspaces, faced significant downsizing, leading to understaffing and high costs due to leases that were not properly terminated. Former GSA officials criticize the abrupt downsizing, stating it went too far and too fast. The GSA's rehiring efforts mirror similar actions in other agencies, such as the IRS and the Labor Department. Democrats have criticized the administration's approach, arguing it has caused confusion and undermined essential services. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Musk, targeted the GSA to reduce fraud and waste, but its aggressive leasing and job-cutting strategies have led to financial losses and operational disruptions. The Government Accountability Office is investigating these issues and expects to release findings soon.
