## Article summary
Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show after a weeklong suspension, addressing the controversy surrounding his remarks about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel clarified that he never intended to make light of Kirk's murder and criticized ABC affiliates who pulled his show from the air, calling their actions un-American. He thanked supporters, including fellow comedians and even political figures like Sen. Ted Cruz, for defending his right to free speech. Kimmel also praised Kirk's widow for her act of forgiveness, emphasizing its significance. The suspension sparked a national debate on free speech and media censorship, with figures like Tom Hanks and Joe Rogan weighing in. Kimmel mocked President Trump's criticism of his ratings and highlighted the broader implications of government interference in media. The incident occurred amid shifts in the late-night television landscape, with declining viewership and recent cancellations like Stephen Colbert's show.
