## Article summary
Björk's *Vulnicura VR Remastered*, now available on the Apple Vision Pro headset, is a VR experience that delves into the emotional journey of her 2015 album *Vulnicura*, which chronicles her heartbreak. Björk chose VR as the ideal medium to share her loneliness and solitude. The remastered version, created by PulseJet Studios, offers improved graphics, navigation, and spatial audio, allowing users to interact with Björk's world using bare hands. The original project faced technological limitations but was groundbreaking in its use of VR's intimacy. Initially part of the *Björk Digital* exhibition, the VR experience was later released on Steam but still had limitations. The new version is more intuitive and visually enhanced. Björk hopes more musicians will explore VR's artistic potential beyond concert experiences. The VR industry is at a crossroads, with forecasts of growth but also concerns about stagnation. Björk is excited for the future of VR and its democratic potential in music.
