## Article summary
President Trump canceled a scheduled meeting with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, escalating the risk of a government shutdown on October 1. Trump cited the Democrats' demands as unreasonable, including rolling back Medicaid changes and extending Affordable Care Act tax credits. Jeffries and Schumer criticized Trump's decision, with Jeffries accusing him of avoiding negotiations and Schumer calling Trump's actions a tantrum. Schumer blamed Trump and Republicans for holding the country hostage. The House recently passed a short-term funding bill, but the Senate lacked the votes to advance it. Both chambers are on recess, with the Senate planning to address funding on September 29. GOP leaders blame Democrats for any potential shutdown, dubbing it 'the Schumer shutdown.' Jeffries announced a virtual meeting with House Democrats to discuss next steps, emphasizing their readiness to work.
