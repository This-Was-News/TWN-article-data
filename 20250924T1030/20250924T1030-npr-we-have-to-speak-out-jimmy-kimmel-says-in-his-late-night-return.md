## Article summary
Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show, *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, after a nearly week-long suspension, addressing the controversy surrounding his comments about the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. He opened with humor, acknowledging the unusual circumstances of his return, and then turned emotional, expressing his condolences to Kirk's family and clarifying that he never intended to make light of the murder. Kimmel emphasized the importance of free speech and the risks Disney takes by bringing his show back, especially given the current political climate. He also addressed threats to his career and the show's future. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump criticized ABC for reinstating Kimmel, hinting at potential legal action and accusing the comedian of being a mouthpiece for the Democratic National Committee. The controversy stemmed from Kimmel's characterization of the suspect in Kirk's killing as a MAGA conservative, which drew backlash from figures like FCC Chair Brendan Carr. Several ABC affiliates, including those operated by Nexstar and Sinclair, preempted the show, and discussions about its future are ongoing.
