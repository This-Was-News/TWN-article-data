## Article summary
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr is continuing his campaign against perceived liberal bias in broadcasts, even after Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned to ABC. Carr has been vocal on conservative media, defending his actions and suggesting investigations into shows like The View. He aims to empower local TV stations to reject programming they disagree with, leveraging the FCC's power to withhold licenses. Carr's actions have sparked criticism from lawmakers on both sides, with some accusing him of censorship. A telecom lawyer by background, Carr has been a prominent conservative voice, criticizing tech companies and advocating for free speech. As FCC chairman, he has reopened complaints about biased programming during the 2024 election and is pushing to broaden the agency's mandate to oversee TV content. Carr's strategy has drawn praise from President Trump but alarm from others, including Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Rand Paul.
