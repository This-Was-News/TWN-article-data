## Article summary
President Trump has found the Jeffrey Epstein story to be a persistent challenge that he cannot evade or control, unlike other news cycles he typically manages to deflect. Despite his usual strategy of dominating the news with multiple topics, the Epstein files, which highlight his past friendship with the convicted sex offender, have continued to dog him. Trump attempted various tactics to distract from the issue, including urging Republicans to stop discussing it and trying to block the release of the files. He even threatened primary challenges against GOP members who opposed him on this matter. However, lawmakers advocating for the release of the documents have succeeded in overcoming Trump's efforts. Facing an imminent House vote against his wishes, Trump reluctantly agreed to legislation that would compel his administration to release the withheld documents. He expressed his reluctance, still labeling the files a "hoax" and maintaining his denial of any involvement or knowledge of Epstein's activities.
