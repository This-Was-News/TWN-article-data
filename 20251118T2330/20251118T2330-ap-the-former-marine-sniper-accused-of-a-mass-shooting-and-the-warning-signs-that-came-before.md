## Article summary
Nigel Max Edge, a wounded Iraq War veteran, is accused of a mass shooting at a North Carolina bar that left three dead and five injured. Estranged family and friends, as well as a judge, had raised concerns about Edge's mental state months prior to the incident. Edge, formerly known as Sean DeBevoise, served as a Marine sniper and was medically retired after being shot multiple times in Iraq. His ex-wife, Rachel Crowl, described his deteriorating mental health after his return, including paranoia and delusions. Edge filed numerous lawsuits against acquaintances and institutions, alleging conspiracies against him. His mother noted his delusions and PTSD, stating the VA needed to care for him. A judge had previously ordered Edge to stay away from a former friend, Marc Simmons, whom Edge had accused of identity theft. Despite these warning signs, it remains unclear if any legal interventions, such as a red flag law or involuntary commitment, were pursued. Experts suggest individuals like Edge can fall through the cracks of the system. Edge has continued to file legal appeals from jail, linking recent events to self-defense against 'White Supremacist Pedophiles'.
