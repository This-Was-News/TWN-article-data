## Article summary
President Donald Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House with considerable pomp, despite U.S. intelligence findings suggesting the prince's likely culpability in the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump dismissed these findings, stating that "things happen" and that the crown prince "knew nothing about it." This visit marks the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia's first White House appearance in seven years, signaling a warming of relations that had previously been strained by the Khashoggi incident. Trump views the crown prince as a crucial figure for Middle East stability and praised Saudi Arabia's human rights progress, though human rights groups criticized Trump's stance and called him "complicit" in the kingdom's actions. The visit also highlighted significant Saudi investment in the U.S., with plans to increase investments to $1 trillion. Trump's administration agreed to sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, a move that raised some concerns about technology transfer to China and Israel's military edge. The visit occurred amidst ongoing efforts by Trump to broker normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel, a goal complicated by Saudi demands for a clear path to a Palestinian state. The crown prince expressed Saudi Arabia's desire to join the Abraham Accords but stressed the necessity of a two-state solution first.
