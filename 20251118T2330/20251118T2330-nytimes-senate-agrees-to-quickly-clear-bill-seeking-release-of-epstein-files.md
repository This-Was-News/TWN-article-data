## Article summary
The House of Representatives has overwhelmingly approved a bill demanding the release of all files related to the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. This near-unanimous vote, 427 to 1, marks a significant shift, as Republicans had previously worked to block such measures. The bill will now proceed to the Senate, where it is expected to pass quickly and be sent to President Trump for his signature. President Trump, who initially opposed the bill, has stated he will sign it into law. This development highlights divisions within the Republican party and President Trump's waning control over his coalition. Despite the legislative action, some proponents question whether the Justice Department will fully comply with the release of the files. The Epstein affair continues to be a persistent issue for President Trump, one he has struggled to evade. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is also moving to dismantle parts of the Education Department, transferring its responsibilities to other agencies. In separate news, a coalition of state election officials is questioning the administration's use of private voter data, expressing concerns about transparency and potential misuse. Additionally, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against New York State regarding immigration arrests near state courthouses.
