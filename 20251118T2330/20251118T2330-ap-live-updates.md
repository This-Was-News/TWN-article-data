## Article summary
The Senate has agreed to pass a bill that will compel the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, overcoming previous opposition from President Donald Trump and Republican leadership. This bipartisan effort, initiated by a group of House lawmakers, marks a significant victory for Epstein survivors seeking accountability. Despite initial resistance, Trump has stated he will sign the bill once it reaches his desk. The bill's passage is seen as a pivotal moment in addressing failures in law enforcement's handling of Epstein's abuse cases over multiple administrations. In other news, federal judges have blocked Texas from using a new congressional map deemed racially gerrymandered, a decision that impacts Trump's efforts to bolster the Republican party's majority. The Trump administration is also proceeding with plans to dismantle parts of the Education Department by transferring grant programs to other agencies. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is stepping down from public commitments following the release of emails showing his continued contact with Epstein. Meanwhile, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is visiting the White House, with plans for significant U.S. investments and discussions on various bilateral issues, though human rights groups have voiced concerns about Saudi Arabia's repression. Additionally, the U.S. has approved an arms sale to Ukraine to support its Patriot missile systems.
