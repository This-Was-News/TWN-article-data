## Article summary
The U.S. Mint has ended production of the one-cent coin, affectionately known as the penny, after 232 years. This tiny disc of zinc with a smidge of copper has played a significant role in American discourse and history. Introduced in its current form in 1793, the penny's value has diminished over time, with its production cost now exceeding its face value; it costs nearly 4 cents to produce a single penny. The coin's origins trace back to the British penny, and the first U.S. one-cent coin, the fugio cent, was minted in 1787. Abraham Lincoln's image was first featured on the penny in 1909, coinciding with the addition of "In God We Trust," a phrase that later became the national motto. Despite no new pennies being minted, existing ones will remain in circulation for approximately 30 more years. The penny's small size and denomination make it a perfect subject for aphorisms, such as "a penny saved is a penny earned" and "give your two cents' worth." While the myth of a penny dropped from a tall building being fatal was debunked, the coin's legacy will endure through its cultural impact and familiar sayings.
