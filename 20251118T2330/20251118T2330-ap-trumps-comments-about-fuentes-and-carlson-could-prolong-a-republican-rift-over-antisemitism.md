## Article summary
Donald Trump is navigating a debate over antisemitism within the Republican Party, sparked by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson's interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Trump has refrained from condemning Fuentes and praised Carlson, a stance that has drawn criticism from some Jewish organizations and conservative activists. This reluctance to disavow controversial figures echoes past instances, such as his comments following the Charlottesville events and his remarks to the Proud Boys. The controversy has created a rift within the Republican Party, with some groups like the Heritage Foundation facing internal turmoil and external pressure to condemn antisemitism. Conservative leaders are holding events to address the rise of antisemitism on the right, expressing concern that it is not being adequately challenged. The Republican Jewish Coalition has also focused on this issue, with some members describing an "undeclared civil war" within the party regarding Israel and antisemitism. Despite the ongoing debate, Trump's public statements have largely focused on his administration's support for Israel, avoiding direct engagement with the controversy surrounding Fuentes and Carlson. This situation highlights the ongoing challenge for Republicans in balancing different factions within their party and addressing concerns about extremism and antisemitism.
