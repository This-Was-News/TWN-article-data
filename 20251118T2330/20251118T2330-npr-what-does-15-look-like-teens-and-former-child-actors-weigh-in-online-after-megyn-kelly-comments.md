## Article summary
Former child actresses and teenage girls have taken to social media to express outrage following comments made by commentator Megyn Kelly on her podcast. Kelly appeared to downplay the age of Jeffrey Epstein's victims, suggesting he was not a pedophile but rather interested in "barely legal type, like, 15-year-old girls." This sparked a backlash, with many insisting that 15-year-olds are children. Actress Cynthia Nixon questioned Kelly's stance, emphasizing that sexual activity with individuals under 16 is illegal. Celebrities like Christina Ricci and Valerie Bertinelli shared photos of themselves at 15, asserting their status as children at that age and encouraging others to do the same. Actual teenagers also responded, with one 14-year-old calling Kelly's comments a "reality check from a literal child" and arguing that defending predators by debating a child's age is unacceptable. The controversy occurred as survivors of Epstein's abuse and advocacy groups are pushing for the release of the Department of Justice files on Epstein's case. These efforts culminated in a House of Representatives vote to publicly release the files, a move supported by the President. The Epstein Files Transparency Act aims to shed light on those who enabled Epstein's operation and ensure accountability under the law.
