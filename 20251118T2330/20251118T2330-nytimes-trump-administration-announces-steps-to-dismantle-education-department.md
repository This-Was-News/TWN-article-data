## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced a plan to dismantle the Education Department, transferring key responsibilities to other federal agencies. The Labor Department will assume oversight of K-12 and college programs previously managed by the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Office of Postsecondary Education. Child care grants for college students and foreign medical school accreditation will move to the Health and Human Services Department. The State Department will take over Fulbright programs and international education grants, while the Interior Department will absorb the Indian Education Office. This move aligns with President Trump's stated goal of eventually closing the department, a move that requires congressional action and faces opposition from educators and student advocates. Administration officials claim these changes will streamline bureaucracy, reduce red tape, and direct more funding to classrooms, ultimately refocusing education on students, families, and schools.
