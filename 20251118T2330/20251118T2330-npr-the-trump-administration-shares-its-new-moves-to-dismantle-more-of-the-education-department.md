## Article summary
The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to dismantle parts of the U.S. Department of Education by outsourcing significant functions to other federal agencies. This move, which bypasses Congress, involves shifting work related to elementary and secondary education, postsecondary education, and Indian education to agencies like the Department of Labor and the Department of the Interior. The administration argues this will reduce bureaucracy and empower states and local leaders, as stated by Education Secretary Linda McMahon. However, opponents contend that these actions are illegal because Congress established these offices within the Education Department. They argue that such significant changes require congressional approval. Several key programs, including Title I funding for low-income students and international education initiatives, are affected. The Child Care Access Means Parents in School program will move to Health and Human Services. While the department claims statutory responsibilities will remain, the practical implications for program effectiveness and oversight are questioned. Legal challenges are anticipated, with critics like Senator Patty Murray asserting that these moves will harm students and families by weakening essential programs. The plan aligns with broader conservative efforts to reduce the federal government's role in education, as indicated by individuals involved in policy initiatives like Project 2025.
