## Article summary
The U.S. deported approximately 50 migrants to Ukraine this week, marking the largest single deportation flight to the war-torn country since Russia's invasion. Immigration lawyers express concern that these individuals, including men eligible for conscription, may be forced to fight in the war, potentially violating international laws against deporting people to areas of violence. While Ukraine's State Border Service confirmed registration of its citizens upon arrival, the embassy did not comment on their fate. This deportation follows a pattern by the Trump administration to arrange deals with various countries, some facing conflict, for the reception of deportees. Lawyers highlight that many on the flight have lived in the U.S. since childhood, have American citizen family members, and some do not speak Ukrainian or are not Ukrainian citizens. One individual, Roman Surovtsev, who was born in the Soviet Union and had a prior conviction, was nearly deported but his removal was stayed by an immigration court. His lawyers argue he has not had the opportunity to express fear of deportation to a war zone, while the Department of Homeland Security stated he has received due process and is a "criminal illegal alien."
