## Article summary
A panel of three federal judges has blocked Texas from using a new congressional map, which was drawn by Republicans with the aim of gaining five additional U.S. House seats. The judges ruled 2-1 that the map, redrawn during the summer, would harm Black and Hispanic residents, constituting a racial gerrymander that violates federal law and the Constitution. This decision is a significant setback for Republican efforts to reshape the political landscape ahead of the 2026 elections. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has stated his intention to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, asserting the map was drawn for partisan advantage and not discrimination. Civil rights groups, however, argued that the map dilutes the voting power of minority communities. The judges indicated that the plaintiffs have a strong chance of winning their case at trial. The ruling stated that a key factor in the redrawing was a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, which Texas officials interpreted as a directive to redraw districts that violated the Voting Rights Act. Republicans contend the map was drawn for partisan reasons, which the U.S. Supreme Court has previously ruled is a political question. The new map reduced the number of congressional districts where minorities form a majority and eliminated several coalition districts, disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic lawmakers. If the ruling stands, Texas will revert to using the 2021 map for the upcoming elections.
