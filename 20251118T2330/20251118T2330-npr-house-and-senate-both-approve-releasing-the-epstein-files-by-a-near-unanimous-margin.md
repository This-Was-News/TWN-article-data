## Article summary
Both the House and Senate have overwhelmingly approved a measure compelling the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bill passed the House with a near-unanimous vote of 427 to 1, with the lone dissenting vote cast by Rep. Clay Higgins. The Senate is expected to pass the House measure without a formal vote. This legislative action represents a rare instance of Republicans defying President Trump, who has now stated he will sign the bill. The push for release was a bipartisan effort, led by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, and faced significant opposition from Trump and Republican leadership for months. Trump's support for the bill marked a dramatic reversal from his previous stance. Survivors of Epstein's abuse also spoke out, urging the President to avoid politicizing their pursuit of justice. The release of these files follows a recent wave of Epstein-related documents that have raised new questions about Trump's past association with Epstein.
