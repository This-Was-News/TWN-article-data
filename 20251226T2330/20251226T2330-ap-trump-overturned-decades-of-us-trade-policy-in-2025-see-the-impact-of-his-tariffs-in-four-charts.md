## Article summary
President Donald Trump's return to the White House in 2025 has led to a significant overhaul of U.S. trade policy, characterized by the imposition of widespread import tariffs. These tariffs, described as a "wall of tariffs," have disrupted global commerce and increased costs for consumers and businesses worldwide, while also generating tens of billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury. Trump has asserted that these measures are necessary to reclaim wealth, reduce the nation's trade deficit, and bring manufacturing back to the U.S. However, the disruption to global supply chains has resulted in rising prices for households. The implementation of these tariffs was marked by volatility, with frequent announcements, suspensions, and alterations, making 2025 a turbulent economic year. The effective U.S. tariff rate saw a significant increase, peaking in April and reaching its highest point since 1935 by November. While tariff revenue has increased substantially, it remains a small fraction of the federal government's total revenue. Despite a narrowing of the trade deficit, the year-to-date deficit remained higher than the previous year. The tariffs have notably impacted U.S. trade with China, leading to a substantial decrease in imports from that country, while imports from Mexico, Vietnam, and Taiwan have grown. The stock market experienced significant volatility, with major swings coinciding with the most turbulent periods of tariff implementation.
