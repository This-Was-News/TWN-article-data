## Article summary
Benjamin Schoonwinkel, a white South African Afrikaner, traveled to the United States after President Trump declared that his administration would welcome white South Africans facing discrimination. However, upon arrival in Atlanta on a tourist visa and seeking asylum, Schoonwinkel was detained. He has been held for nearly 100 days in a federal detention center, a situation he did not anticipate. Schoonwinkel's case highlights a curious outcome of Trump's immigration policies, where a group singled out for protection is now subject to the same long detentions typically faced by migrants from Latin America. The Trump administration had prioritized Afrikaners for refugee status, citing alleged discrimination and violence against them in South Africa, claims disputed by the South African government. While other Afrikaners have arrived through the official refugee program, Schoonwinkel chose to seek asylum at a port of entry, leading to his detention under a new protocol. His lawyer argues that Schoonwinkel's due process rights have been violated and that he should have been released to pursue his asylum case. Schoonwinkel claims he was attacked on his farm in 2014 and sold his land due to security concerns. He is awaiting a hearing to present the merits of his asylum case, with his lawyer confident in its winnability given Trump's previous statements. Meanwhile, Schoonwinkel remains in detention, facing health issues and awaiting potential release, with his friend hoping President Trump would intervene if aware of the situation.
