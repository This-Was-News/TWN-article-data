## Article summary
President Trump announced U.S. airstrikes in northwestern Nigeria targeting Islamic State terrorists, claiming they primarily victimize Christians. However, analysts suggest the situation is more complex, with Sokoto State, the primary strike location, being predominantly Muslim and experiencing widespread terrorist attacks affecting all communities. There is also division among analysts regarding the alleged ties between local insurgent groups, known as Lakurawa, and the Islamic State's Sahel Province branch. Despite disputing Trump's claims of Christian genocide, the Nigerian government has cooperated with the U.S. airstrikes, viewing them as an opportunity to combat insurgents plaguing rural areas. Nigerian officials emphasized that communications regarding the strikes should not focus on religion and that future operations would require Nigerian approval. The immediate impact of the strikes remains unclear, with reports of ordnance found in an area not known for terrorist activity. Experts note that the most documented ISIS affiliate in Nigeria is in the northeast, far from Sokoto. The violence in Nigeria affects both Muslims and Christians, and the government rejects the characterization of a Christian genocide. The strikes may resonate with some American Christians and political allies of Trump who support the narrative of Christian persecution in Nigeria, though some argue the counterterrorism efforts should be based on national security risks rather than ideology.
