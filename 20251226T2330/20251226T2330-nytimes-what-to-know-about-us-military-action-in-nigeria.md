## Article summary
The United States conducted military strikes in northwestern Nigeria targeting Islamic State camps, following President Trump's earlier threat to take action if the Nigerian government did not halt the killing of Christians by Islamist militants. While Trump cited a genocide of Christians, analysts suggest the situation is more complex, with U.S. military officials expressing doubts about the effectiveness of such strikes in quelling regional violence. The strikes, involving Tomahawk cruise missiles, were announced by Trump on social media, who accused the group of targeting Christians. The Defense Department stated it worked with the Nigerian government, which confirmed its cooperation and provision of intelligence. Trump had previously threatened to cut aid and take direct military action if the killing of Christians continued, and the U.S. reinstated Nigeria as a country of particular concern for religious freedom violations. Nigeria has denied accusations of religious intolerance, with President Tinubu stating the government safeguards religious freedom for all. Despite these denials, Nigerian authorities cooperated with the U.S. strikes. Nigeria faces significant terrorism from groups like Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), with recent coups in the region creating opportunities for insurgent expansion. However, the U.S. decision to strike Sokoto, a predominantly Muslim area, has puzzled some analysts, who question the documented links of ISWAP to the Islamic State and its primary operational area. Experts believe the strikes may serve to appeal to certain American political and religious groups by appearing to address the persecution narrative, while also addressing U.S. security concerns about the Islamic State.
