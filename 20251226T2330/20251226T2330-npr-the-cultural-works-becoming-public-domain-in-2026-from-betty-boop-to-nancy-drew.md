## Article summary
In 2026, a vast collection of cultural works from 1930 will enter the public domain, becoming free for all to use, share, and adapt. This includes iconic characters like the original Betty Boop and Disney's Pluto (initially named Rover), as well as literary works such as William Faulkner's "As I Lay Dying," Dashiell Hammett's "The Maltese Falcon," and Agatha Christie's first Miss Marple mystery, "The Murder at the Vicarage." The film selection is diverse, featuring titles like "All Quiet on the Western Front," "Animal Crackers," and early performances by stars like John Wayne and Greta Garbo, notably predating the Hays Code. Musical compositions, including "Georgia on My Mind" and Gershwin songs, alongside artworks like Piet Mondrian's "Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow," also join the public domain. This influx of works offers new creative possibilities, such as developing original musicals or films without copyright restrictions, as seen with the upcoming Betty Boop horror movie. Beyond creative reuse, the public domain enhances accessibility, leading to cheaper book editions and the digitization of deteriorating films. It also provides valuable resources for educators and allows for a deeper appreciation of human creativity, especially in contrast to emerging AI-generated content. Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, highlights the importance of these works in nurturing creativity and enabling access, emphasizing that human authorship remains crucial for copyright protection.
