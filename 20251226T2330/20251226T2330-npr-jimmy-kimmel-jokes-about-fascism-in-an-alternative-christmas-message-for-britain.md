## Article summary
Jimmy Kimmel delivered an "Alternative Christmas Message" to U.K. viewers on Channel 4, using the platform to satirize Donald Trump and warn about the rise of fascism. Kimmel, whose show had recently been suspended by ABC following controversial comments, remarked that it had been a "great year" for fascism and that "tyranny is booming." He noted that Trump, who he described as acting like a king, celebrated his show's suspension. Kimmel highlighted the incident as a threat to freedom of speech and the press, mentioning that hundreds of Hollywood stars had defended free speech, leading to his show's return. He expressed gratitude for the support and declared his return to air, continuing to criticize the "most powerful politician on earth." Kimmel acknowledged that the U.S. is experiencing a "wobble" and "tearing down the structures of our democracy," affecting the U.K. as well, and apologized for the situation. Channel 4's tradition of an alternative Christmas message began in 1993 as a counterpoint to the British monarch's address, often featuring thought-provoking reflections on the year's events.
