## Article summary
Bonner Springs, Kansas, is providing over $200 million in tax incentives, primarily through STAR bonds, for the development of a $540 million Mattel Adventure Park. This park will feature attractions based on Barbie and Hot Wheels and is planned for construction near an existing entertainment district. City officials anticipate the project will significantly boost local tax revenues and nearly double the city's taxable property value, potentially offering property tax relief to residents. Developers estimate the park will generate $190 million in annual revenue and expect construction to begin in 2027, with an opening in 2031. However, a public finance expert from the University of Kansas, Zach Mohr, warns that STAR bonds commit future state revenue and could strain the state's finances, especially with multiple such projects already underway. While STAR bonds are designed to fund projects with new tax revenue, Mohr argues they tie up future earnings and that the state may be approaching a tipping point for sustaining these large developments. He also points out the risk posed by the increasing popularity of online shopping, which could divert sales tax revenue away from the state and impact the expected economic benefits of such projects.
