## Article summary
Powerful winter storms brought the wettest Christmas season to Southern California in years, causing significant flooding and mudslides. In Wrightwood, a mountain town, roads turned into rivers of mud, burying cars and destroying homes. Firefighters conducted numerous rescues, including pulling people from stranded vehicles. Despite the rain lessening around Los Angeles, the risk of flash flooding and mudslides remained. Nearby Lytle Creek saw a bridge destroyed by raging waters, cutting off a neighborhood. The storms also impacted other parts of the country, with New York anticipating its largest snowfall in three years and Connecticut urging people to avoid travel due to an approaching winter storm. California's storm brought 3 inches of rain to downtown Los Angeles, the most in 54 years, with some Ventura County areas receiving up to 17 inches. The Sierra Nevada region expected heavy snowfall and treacherous conditions, leading to avalanche rescues. Sadly, at least three deaths were attributed to the severe weather across California.
