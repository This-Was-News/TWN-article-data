## Article summary
President Trump's executive order to reschedule marijuana to Schedule III aims to ease federal restrictions, but the changes will not be immediate or comprehensive. While the order promises relief for cannabis businesses, particularly regarding the punitive tax code Section 280E, other significant changes will require further action. The Controlled Substances Act does not grant the president unilateral authority to reschedule drugs; this typically involves a rulemaking process or an act of Congress. The Trump administration could expedite the process by utilizing a specific section of the Act, potentially bypassing a public comment period, though this might invite legal challenges. If the expedited route is taken, the DOJ could issue a final rule without extensive public input, speeding up the rescheduling. Cannabis businesses anticipate immediate tax relief from the removal of Section 280E, which currently prevents them from deducting normal business expenses, leading to higher effective tax rates. However, other restrictions, such as the inability of cannabis operations to accept credit cards due to banking regulations, may persist. While rescheduling is expected to boost medical research by easing licensing and laboratory requirements, challenges in sourcing marijuana for study may continue. Experts caution that not all anticipated benefits will materialize instantly, as many changes depend on further agency policies and regulatory adjustments.
