## Article summary
Nigerian villagers in Jabo are shaken by U.S. airstrikes targeting an alleged Islamic State group camp near their homes. The strikes, which involved precision missiles and drones, caused homes to shake and the sky to glow red, leading to panic and confusion among residents. The Nigerian government confirmed its cooperation with the U.S. in the operation, stating it was a response to foreign IS fighters entering from the Sahel. While the government did not release casualty figures for militants, villagers expressed fear and a lack of information about the events. Analysts suggest the strikes may have targeted the Lakurawa group, a relatively new militant faction in Nigeria, though its direct ties to IS are unproven. The incident highlights the ongoing security crisis in Nigeria and the complexities of counter-terrorism efforts. Residents fear for their safety and the disruption to their daily lives, with one young woman expressing anxiety about her upcoming wedding. The Nigerian foreign minister described the strikes as a new phase in an old conflict, anticipating further actions. Security analysts emphasize the need for transparency to calm local populations and prevent escalating tensions.
