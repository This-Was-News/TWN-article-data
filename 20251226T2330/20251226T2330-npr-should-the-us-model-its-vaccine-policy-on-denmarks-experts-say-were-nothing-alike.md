## Article summary
Experts are questioning the idea of the U.S. modeling its vaccine policy on Denmark's, citing significant differences between the two countries. Denmark recommends vaccinations for 10 diseases, while the U.S. schedule includes 16. However, experts like Josh Michaud and Dr. Sean O'Leary emphasize that these differences stem from vastly different contexts. Denmark has a smaller, more homogeneous population, a unified national health system with a registry tracking all citizens, and extensive paid parental leave, which can reduce infant exposure to diseases. In contrast, the U.S. has a large, diverse population, a fragmented health insurance system, and millions uninsured, leading to challenges in identifying and following up with at-risk individuals. Dr. Jake Scott points out that the U.S. also has higher rates of childhood obesity and asthma, increasing risk for certain diseases. Dr. William Moss suggests the U.S. schedule prioritizes disease prevention due to these factors. Contrary to the notion that the U.S. is an outlier, Michaud notes that Denmark's schedule is unusually minimalist compared to other European countries like Germany, France, and Italy, which recommend more vaccines. The U.S. schedule is more in line with the average of 30 European countries. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed a desire to align U.S. policy with peer nations, specifically mentioning Denmark, but any overhaul faces potential legal challenges due to procedural concerns.
