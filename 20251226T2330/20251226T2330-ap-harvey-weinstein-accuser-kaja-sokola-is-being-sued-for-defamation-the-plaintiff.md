## Article summary
Kaja Sokola, an accuser of Harvey Weinstein, is now facing a defamation lawsuit filed by her own sister, Ewa Sokola. Ewa, a cardiologist in Poland, alleges that Kaja's public statements about her testimony in Weinstein's criminal trial constitute libel and are damaging her reputation and business. Kaja had accused Weinstein of sexual assault, and Ewa was called as a witness to support her sister's claims. However, Kaja later stated that Ewa's testimony inadvertently aided Weinstein's defense. According to the lawsuit, Kaja falsely accused Ewa of betraying her, omitting crucial journal entries, and engaging in various other wrongdoings, including homicide and falsification of medical records. These accusations have reportedly led to a loss of patients and damage to Ewa's professional standing. Weinstein was convicted in June on some charges, with a mistrial declared on another. He awaits sentencing as his defense team seeks to overturn the verdict. The lawsuit highlights a significant rift between the two sisters following the high-profile trial.
