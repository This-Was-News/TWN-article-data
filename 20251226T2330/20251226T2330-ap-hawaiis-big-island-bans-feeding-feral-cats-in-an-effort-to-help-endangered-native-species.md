## Article summary
Hawaiis Big Island has enacted a new law banning the feeding of feral cats on county property, effective at the start of the new year. This measure aims to protect endangered native species, such as the nene goose, which are vulnerable to predation by feral cats, considered a super predator introduced to the islands. The ban is controversial, with many cat lovers, like Liz Swan, who has fed feral cats for 33 years, expressing concern that it will lead to the cats starving or having to hunt more. Estimates suggest tens of thousands of feral cats live on the Big Island, supported by people who feed them. Biologists argue that feeding feral cats not only directly threatens native wildlife through predation but also indirectly by attracting native animals to human areas and spreading diseases like toxoplasmosis, which has harmed Hawaiian monk seals and native birds. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources supports the ban, citing an incident where a nene was killed by a car while crossing a road to reach a cat feeding station. Despite the ban, some, like Swan, vow to continue feeding the cats in secret, while others, like cultural practitioner Makaʻala Kaʻaumoana, believe removal is the only solution. Mayor Kimo Alameda, though sympathetic to the cats, allowed the ban to take effect, hoping enforcement will be a low priority, with fines ranging from $50 to $500.
