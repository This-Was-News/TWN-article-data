## Article summary
MLB pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz have been indicted on federal charges for allegedly accepting bribes from sports bettors to manipulate their pitches. The indictment, unsealed Sunday in Brooklyn, claims the pitchers received thousands of dollars to help gamblers win at least $460,000 on prop bets related to pitch speed and outcome. Clase and Ortiz have been on paid leave since July while Major League Baseball investigated unusual betting activity during their games. Ortiz was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport, while Clase was not in custody. U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. stated that the players betrayed the integrity of professional sports. Ortiz's lawyer maintains his client's innocence, asserting that payments were for lawful activities and that Ortiz never improperly influenced a game. The indictment details specific instances where Clase allegedly rigged first pitches, including tossing balls in the dirt or at slower speeds than expected, to benefit bettors. Ortiz is accused of similar actions in games in June. These charges are part of a broader federal crackdown on betting in professional sports, following recent arrests in the NBA and MLB's own suspensions for gambling violations. Clase and Ortiz face charges including wire fraud conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, with potential penalties of up to 20 years in prison.
