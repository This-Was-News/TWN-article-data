## Article summary
The top Senate Republican, John Thune, expressed optimism on Sunday that a deal to end the government shutdown was coming together. He indicated that a test vote could happen as early as Sunday evening, suggesting enough Democrats might be persuaded to support a spending measure. This potential breakthrough follows intense negotiations among moderate senators from both parties. Republicans, who control the Senate, have struggled to gain sufficient Democratic support for previous spending bills. A key sticking point has been the Republican refusal to extend Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies. However, Thune's comments imply a shift, potentially bringing Democrats on board. The ongoing negotiations involve a stopgap measure to fund the government through January, alongside separate spending bills for agriculture, military construction, and legislative agencies for most of 2026. The shutdown has now stretched into its 40th day.
