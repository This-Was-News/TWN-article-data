## Article summary
A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment rights of Education Department employees by replacing their personalized out-of-office email messages with partisan language. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper stated that government employees do not forfeit their First Amendment rights upon entering public service. The lawsuit was initiated by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which argued that the administration's actions were a clear violation of these rights. The department had replaced employees' drafted out-of-office messages with a statement blaming Senate Democrats for the government shutdown. Judge Cooper ordered the department to immediately reinstate the employees' original out-of-office notifications or remove the partisan language entirely. He criticized the department for using its workforce as political spokespeople through their official email accounts. The ruling emphasizes the principle of nonpartisanship, which is fundamental to the federal civil-service system and protected by the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act aims to shield public employees from political pressure and ensure nonpartisan administration of federal programs. The department has not yet commented on the ruling.
