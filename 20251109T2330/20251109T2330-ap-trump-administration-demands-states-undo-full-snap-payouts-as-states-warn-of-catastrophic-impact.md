## Article summary
The Trump administration is demanding that states reverse full SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefit payouts that were issued under court orders, following a Supreme Court stay on those rulings. This demand comes as numerous states warn of "catastrophic operational disruptions" if the federal government does not reimburse them for the benefits they distributed. The legal battle centers on the administration's efforts to restrict SNAP benefits, which has led to a back-and-forth in the courts and confusion for states and recipients. Nonprofits and Democratic attorneys general had sued to maintain the program during a government shutdown, securing favorable rulings that allowed for the release of benefits. However, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused these rulings, prompting the USDA to declare the prior payments unauthorized and demand states "undo" them, threatening penalties for non-compliance. Several states, including Massachusetts and Wisconsin, have stated they will fight this directive in court or have already refused to comply, arguing they acted legally under court orders. Governors have criticized the administration's actions, calling the situation "intentional chaos" and a repeated attempt to take food away from American families. The ongoing dispute highlights the precarious state of the anti-hunger program, affecting millions of Americans, amidst political maneuvering and legal challenges.
