## Article summary
The head of the BBC, Tim Davie, and the broadcaster's top news executive, Deborah Turness, have resigned following criticism over the editing of a speech by former U.S. President Donald Trump for a BBC documentary. Critics argued the edit was misleading, omitting a part where Trump urged peaceful demonstration. Davie stated the decision to leave was his own, accepting ultimate responsibility for mistakes made. Turness echoed this sentiment, believing the controversy was damaging the BBC and that accountability was necessary. Trump reacted on his Truth Social network, calling the journalists corrupt and dishonest. The controversy intensified after a dossier compiled by an external advisor highlighted issues beyond the Trump speech edit, including coverage of transgender issues and alleged anti-Israel bias. The BBC, funded by a license fee, faces significant scrutiny due to its status as a national institution. Its news output is frequently a subject of political debate, with accusations of both leftist and conservative bias. The broadcaster has also faced criticism for its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, including the temporary removal of a Gaza documentary due to the narrator's family ties to Hamas. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch called for significant reforms, while Labour government minister Lisa Nandy expressed support for the BBC's future role in national life.
