## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown has entered its 40th day, causing significant disruptions. Senate Democrats are divided on whether to support a potential bipartisan spending deal that would reopen the government but does not guarantee the extension of Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies. Senator John Thune, the Republican majority leader, expressed optimism about a breakthrough, with a test vote possibly occurring soon. Meanwhile, a federal judge has stepped down, warning that President Trump poses an existential threat to democracy and accusing him of using the law for partisan purposes. Michelle Obama has criticized President Trump's demolition of the East Wing of the White House for a ballroom, deeming it a denigration of the First Lady's traditional domain. The Trump administration has also demanded that states undo actions to provide full food stamp benefits, leading to legal challenges and uncertainty for millions of low-income Americans. Airport disruptions are worsening, with thousands of flights canceled due to reduced air traffic controller staffing, and further cuts are expected as Thanksgiving approaches. President Trump has renewed his attacks on the Affordable Care Act, suggesting subsidies should go directly to consumers rather than insurance companies, though details remain scarce. A timeline of the legal battles over food stamp benefits reveals a complex and ongoing struggle between the administration and states seeking to ensure full funding for the program. The situation remains fluid, with potential impacts on millions of Americans as the shutdown continues.
