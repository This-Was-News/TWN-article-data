## Article summary
Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly associated with al-Qaida and held in a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq, is set to become the first Syrian president to visit the White House. This follows his rise to power after rebel forces ousted Bashar Assad last December. Al-Sharaa has been actively engaging in diplomacy, seeking to establish new ties with countries that had previously shunned Assad's government. He previously met with President Trump in Saudi Arabia, leading to the announcement of lifting sanctions on Syria. Their upcoming meeting in Washington is expected to solidify Syria's official entry into the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group. Al-Sharaa also aims to advocate for the full repeal of the Caesar Act, which imposed sweeping sanctions on Syria. While some U.S. senators support the repeal, certain Republicans in the House have expressed reservations and are pushing for conditions. Skeptics raise concerns about sectarian violence and the accountability of perpetrators under al-Sharaa's leadership. Advocacy groups are urging President Trump to address the massacre of minorities and facilitate humanitarian aid. The U.S. views Syria's potential membership in the anti-IS coalition as a significant milestone, enabling closer cooperation between U.S. and Syrian forces. Despite territorial losses, IS cells continue to carry out attacks in Syria and Iraq, underscoring the ongoing need for counter-terrorism efforts.
