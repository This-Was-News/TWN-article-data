## Article summary
Airlines are reducing flights at numerous major U.S. airports to alleviate pressure on air traffic controllers who are working unpaid and under strain due to the ongoing government shutdown. The Federal Aviation Administration deems these cutbacks necessary for traveler safety. Major hubs like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago are affected, potentially leading to more cancellations, longer delays, and fuller flights nationwide. The list of impacted airports spans over two dozen states, including busy ones like Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Even if the shutdown ends soon, flight restrictions will remain until staffing levels ensure safety, which could take time. Airlines will notify customers of cancellations, but checking airline apps or flight-tracking sites is advised. If plans are disrupted, travelers are encouraged to remain calm and explore options like rebooking, considering alternative transportation like trains or buses, or seeking assistance from airline customer service. While airlines must issue full refunds for cancellations, they are not obligated to cover additional costs like meals or hotels unless the disruption was within their control. Travel advisers and travel insurance can offer additional support, and booking early flights or traveling with carry-on only might help mitigate issues. Giving yourself extra time at the airport and maintaining a polite demeanor with airline staff are also recommended strategies during this period of travel uncertainty.
