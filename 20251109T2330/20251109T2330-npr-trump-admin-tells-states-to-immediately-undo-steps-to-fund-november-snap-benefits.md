## Article summary
The Trump administration has instructed states to immediately reverse any actions taken to fund November SNAP benefits. This directive follows an administrative stay issued by the U.S. Supreme Court, which temporarily blocked a lower court order mandating full SNAP payments for November. The Supreme Court's order is in effect until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rules on the administration's request for a stay in that court. The U.S. Department of Agriculture stated that any states which have already issued full SNAP payments for November did so without authorization and must correct these actions. The directive emphasizes the need to comply with the memorandum and advise the appropriate FNS Regional Office of corrective steps. This situation impacts low-income families who rely on SNAP benefits for food assistance.
