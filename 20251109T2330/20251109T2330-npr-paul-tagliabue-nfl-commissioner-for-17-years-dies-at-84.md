## Article summary
Paul Tagliabue, who served as NFL commissioner for 17 years from 1989 to 2006, has died at the age of 84 due to heart failure. During his tenure, Tagliabue was credited with achieving labor peace and significantly increasing the league's revenue through new stadiums and lucrative television contracts. He also implemented the "Rooney Rule" to promote diversity in coaching and front-office positions. A notable moment in his commissionership was his decision to cancel NFL games the weekend after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. However, he also faced criticism for his handling of concussions, an issue that plagued the league for decades. Tagliabue later apologized for remarks he made in 1994 regarding concussions, acknowledging he lacked sufficient data at the time. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell remembered Tagliabue as a "steward of the game" and a mentor. Tagliabue is survived by his wife, son, and daughter.
