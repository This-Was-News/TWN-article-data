## Article summary
The government shutdown is causing widespread effects, with federal workers staying home, national parks preparing to close, and services being disrupted. In Washington, political leaders are blaming each other, while a small group of senators are discussing potential solutions. Republicans are calling it the 'Schumer Shutdown' and demand the government reopen before negotiations, while Democrats push for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. Vice President JD Vance warned of federal workforce layoffs, breaking past precedents of temporary furloughs. The White House announced the cancellation of infrastructure and green energy projects in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris. Despite party leaders' rigid stances, informal talks among senators continue, focusing on health care policy changes and subsidies. Federal employees' unions are suing over the Office of Management and Budget memo preparing agencies for layoffs. Partisan stopgap bills failed in the Senate, with leaders pointing fingers at each other. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are not directly negotiating, but a small group of lawmakers is working on a compromise. Republicans propose income caps and eliminating waste from the health care program, while Democrats aim to preserve subsidies for working and middle-class people. No votes are planned for Thursday due to the Jewish holiday, with Senate GOP leaders expected to call for another vote on Friday on the House-passed stopgap bill.
