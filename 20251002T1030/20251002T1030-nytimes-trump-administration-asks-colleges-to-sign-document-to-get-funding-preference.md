## Article summary
The Trump Administration sent letters to nine top universities, urging them to sign a 10-page compact to receive priority access to federal research funds. The compact outlines the administration's educational goals, including freezing tuition for five years, capping international student enrollment, and adhering to strict gender definitions. Universities would also need to modify their governance structures to protect conservative ideas. The nine universities include the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Virginia. The administration hopes to extend the compact to all colleges and is open to feedback. The letters were sent as the White House aimed to finalize a settlement with Harvard University, which had sued the administration over its pressure campaign. The compact is part of the administration's broader effort to shift the ideological tilt of higher education, which it views as hostile to conservatives.
