## Article summary
Anti-foreigner sentiments and nationalist politicians are rising in Japan as the country faces a population crisis. Sohei Kamiya, leader of the nationalist party Sanseito, is gaining traction with his anti-immigration and anti-globalism platform. Many Japanese people, frustrated by economic struggles and rising prices, are supporting Kamiya's views. Japan, traditionally insular, is seeing a record surge of foreigners to bolster its shrinking workforce. However, misinformation and protests have led to stricter policies. Kamiya argues that foreign workers benefit big businesses at the expense of Japanese citizens. All candidates in the upcoming Liberal Democratic Party leadership vote are vowing tougher measures on foreigners. Japan's foreign population has reached over 3.7 million, but only a small percentage of them were arrested last year. The country's economy heavily relies on foreign workers, with projections indicating a need for more in the future. Despite economic benefits, prejudice against immigrants persists due to a lack of public support and integration efforts.
