## Article summary
Four people were injured after a car ramming and stabbing incident outside a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The incident occurred at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall, where a car was driven at members of the public and a man was stabbed. Police responded to the scene and shot the suspected offender. The incident has been contained, and the immediate danger is over, according to local authorities. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed his appall at the attack, noting the significance of the timing. The Community Security Trust, which monitors antisemitism in the U.K., highlighted the solemnity of Yom Kippur and the heightened security measures typically in place during major Jewish festivals. Manchester has a history of significant attacks, including the 2017 Ariana Grande concert bombing that killed 22 people.
