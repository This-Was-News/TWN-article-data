## Article summary
The Eaton fire in Altadena, California, in January caused extensive damage and loss of life, with lawsuits blaming Southern California Edison's high power transmission lines. However, an NPR investigation reveals that distribution lines, which power individual homes, also malfunctioned in Altadena hours before the fire started near Eaton Canyon. These malfunctions, which can cause sparks and ignite fires, occurred more than 200 times in the LA region on January 7 due to hurricane-strength winds. Firefighters were dispatched to Altadena multiple times that day due to electrical problems. Despite warnings and evidence of strained power grids, SoCal Edison did not shut off power to most circuits in Altadena, potentially worsening the fire's spread. Residents feel the utility company should have taken more preventive measures. Additionally, SoCal Edison's equipment has been igniting more fires in recent years, and the company is increasing rates despite resident concerns about accountability.
