## Article summary
President Donald Trump is using the government shutdown to reshape the federal workforce and punish political opponents by threatening mass firings and cutting funds for Democratic priorities. The White House has announced layoffs and halted $18 billion in infrastructure funds for New York projects. Trump has praised his budget director, Russ Vought, for aggressive budget cuts. The shutdown risks extending into October, affecting 750,000 federal workers and potentially impacting the broader economy. Congressional leaders are at a standoff, with Democrats insisting on preserving health care funding and Republicans willing to negotiate but not urgently. The Trump administration is using new levers to shape the federal government, including tapping funds for defense and immigration enforcement. Vought has challenged Congress's authority by trying to rescind approved funds for various programs. The Government Accountability Office has issued notices of legal violations by the administration, but the Supreme Court upheld a rescission of foreign aid.
