## Article summary
Youth-led protests are sweeping across Africa, from Madagascar to Morocco, driven by Generation Z's frustration with poor governance and economic hardships. In Madagascar, protests over water and electricity shortages led President Andry Rajoelina to dissolve his government, but demonstrators continue to demand his resignation. Protesters, including a medical student named Fanilo, report severe repression by security forces, with at least 22 people killed according to the United Nations. The protests are organized through social media, using a symbol from the anime 'One Piece' to represent their movement. Inspired by similar protests in Nepal and Indonesia, the youth in Madagascar are calling for a complete overhaul of their system. Across Africa, similar protests have occurred in Kenya, Togo, and Morocco, with young people using platforms like TikTok and Discord to organize. These protests highlight grievances about deteriorating socio-economic conditions, rising living costs, and government failures. Analysts note that Africa's young population, largely under 35 and unemployed, is frustrated with the status quo and leveraging technology to demand change. The protests represent a reckoning for governments that have failed to deliver basic public services and jobs for the youth.
