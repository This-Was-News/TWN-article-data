## Article summary
British primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who revolutionized perceptions of human-animal relations through her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees, has passed away at the age of 91. Her studies revealed that chimps exhibit emotions, use tools, and engage in complex social behaviors, challenging scientific views of the time. Born in London in 1934, Goodall's passion for animals was ignited by her childhood fascination with Tarzan. Despite financial constraints, she pursued her dream, working as a secretary and eventually meeting paleontologist Louis Leakey, who hired her to study chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park. Overcoming initial challenges, Goodall gained the trust of the chimps, discovering their tool-making abilities and documenting their social structures. Her findings, published in National Geographic and other media, made her a global figure. Beyond research, Goodall became an activist, founding the Jane Goodall Institute to protect chimpanzees and their habitats. She traveled extensively, advocating for conservation and animal welfare, and remained a beloved icon until her death.
