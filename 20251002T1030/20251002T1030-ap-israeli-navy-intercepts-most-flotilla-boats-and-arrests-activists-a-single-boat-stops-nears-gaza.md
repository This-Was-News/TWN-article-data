## Article summary
Israeli navy forces intercepted most of the vessels in the Global Sumud Flotilla attempting to break the blockade of Gaza, detaining dozens of activists and European lawmakers, including Greta Thunberg. One boat managed to reach near Gaza's coast before losing contact. The flotilla, the largest yet, aimed to challenge the blockade with over 40 boats and 500 activists carrying symbolic humanitarian aid. Israeli authorities boarded the vessels in international waters, using water cannons and bright lights, while activists streamed the events live. Protests erupted worldwide, with Italy calling a general strike. Several countries, including Turkey, Colombia, Pakistan, and Malaysia, condemned Israel's actions, with Colombia expelling Israel's diplomatic delegation. Israeli authorities stated the detained activists were safe and would be deported. The operation was largely peaceful, but tensions remain high.
