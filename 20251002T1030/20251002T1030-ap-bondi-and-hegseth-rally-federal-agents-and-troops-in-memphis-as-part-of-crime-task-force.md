## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller rallied members of a federal law enforcement task force in Memphis as part of President Donald Trump's crime-fighting plan. The task force, called the Memphis Safe Task Force, aims to make the city safer and attract investment. The officials met with Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and spoke to federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and Tennessee National Guard members. Miller described the task force as an all-of-government, unlimited support operation. Hegseth assured the officers of their support. Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen criticized the visit and the administration's rhetoric, stating that Memphians are not enemies. The task force is part of a larger effort by Trump to use National Guard troops and surge federal law enforcement in cities controlled by Democrats. Bondi announced that the task force has made more than 50 arrests over a two-day period. Opponents argue that the deployment is unnecessary and that the city needs more funding to address poverty and other drivers of crime. Meanwhile, National Guard troops in Oregon are preparing to support federal law enforcement, and immigrant rights activists have criticized recent immigration arrests in Chicago.
