## Article summary
The Supreme Court has temporarily allowed Lisa Cook to remain on the Federal Reserve Board, providing a brief reprieve in her legal battle against President Trump. The decision does not resolve the ongoing threat to the Fed's independence, as the court will hear arguments in January. President Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud, seeking to remove her, but the Federal Reserve Act requires cause for removal. Cook denies the allegations and argues she was not given a fair chance to respond. The case highlights the broader struggle over the independence of federal agencies. Trump has previously fired officials from other agencies, citing policy differences. The outcome of Cook's case could significantly impact the Fed's independence and its ability to set monetary policy. If Trump gains more control over the Fed, it could influence interest rates and Wall Street policies. The next Fed chair appointment and regional bank president reappointments add urgency to the situation. Former Fed chairs and economists warn that political influence could erode public confidence in the Fed's independence.
