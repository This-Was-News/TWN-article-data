## Article summary
Ukraine has presented a new 20-point peace plan, developed with American officials, that differs significantly from a previous proposal which would have required territorial concessions and ruled out NATO membership. This new plan includes security guarantees for Ukraine and rebuilding efforts. However, Russia is unlikely to accept it, viewing it as a "mockery" and a tactic to blame Russia for the plan's failure. Russia's core demands remain Ukraine's withdrawal from parts of Donetsk and Luhansk and ruling out NATO membership. While Russia might cede some occupied land in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, it is determined to fully occupy Donetsk. The Ukrainian plan does not offer compromise on these territories or the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, making it a non-starter for Russia. Despite economic costs, Russia believes it can gain more by continuing the fight, bolstered by a steady flow of new recruits. Russia is engaging in negotiations to maintain relations with Washington, avoid blame for the conflict, and delay further sanctions. The diplomatic discussions are ongoing, with both sides signaling continued engagement, but analysts believe Putin has no intention of ending the war or making significant compromises at this stage. The discussions are seen as a tactical move by the Kremlin to manage relations with the US and create friction between the US and Ukraine.
