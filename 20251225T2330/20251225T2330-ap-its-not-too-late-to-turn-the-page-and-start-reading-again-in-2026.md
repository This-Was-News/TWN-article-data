## Article summary
The percentage of Americans reading for pleasure has significantly declined since 2004, with many adults finding it difficult to resume the habit due to fatigue, lack of time, or the allure of social media. To rekindle a love for books, experts suggest starting with enjoyable, less dense reads and seeking recommendations from friends, booksellers, or online communities. Establishing a consistent reading routine, even for short periods, is crucial, and utilizing formats like e-books and audiobooks can enhance convenience. Creating a distraction-free reading environment is also important, though reading can also be a social activity through silent book clubs. Setting reading goals or participating in challenges can provide motivation, as can observing others' reading habits on social media. It's also acceptable to abandon a book that isn't engaging, as reading should not feel like a chore. Ultimately, reading offers benefits such as stress reduction, increased creativity, and enhanced empathy, making the effort to revive the habit worthwhile.
