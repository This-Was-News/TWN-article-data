## Article summary
The Department of Justice has announced it may require "a few more weeks" to release all documents pertaining to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This delay follows the discovery of over a million potentially relevant documents, which complicates the congressionally mandated deadline. The announcement came after a group of senators urged the Justice Department's watchdog to investigate the failure to meet the deadline, emphasizing that victims deserve full disclosure. Federal prosecutors and the FBI uncovered the additional documents, a surprising development given previous assurances of a comprehensive review. Earlier statements from officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, had suggested a significant amount of evidence had already been produced. The department stated that its lawyers are working diligently to review and redact sensitive information from the newly found files, as mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act. This staggered and heavily redacted release has drawn criticism from victims and lawmakers. Some members of Congress, including chief authors of the disclosure law, have accused the DOJ of illegal redactions and missing the deadline. Concerns about a "massive coverup" have been voiced, questioning what information is being hidden and why. The White House has defended the Justice Department's actions. Records released so far have been largely redacted or previously public, though some new information has emerged, including details about President Trump's travel on Epstein's plane and potential references to Prince Andrew in emails. A call for an inspector general audit has been made to ensure a neutral assessment of the department's compliance with the disclosure requirements.
