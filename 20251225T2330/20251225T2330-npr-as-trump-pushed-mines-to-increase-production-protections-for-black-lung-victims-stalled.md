## Article summary
During President Trump's first year back in office, his administration prioritized boosting mining production, including coal, through deregulation and the establishment of a National Energy Dominance Council. This focus on mining came as new research from the CDC revealed nearly 2,000 deaths from black lung disease between 2020 and 2023, a number significantly higher than previously expected. Despite decades of knowledge that silica dust causes black lung, miners were allowed double the dust exposure limits of other workers. In 2024, a new safety rule was finalized to limit silica dust exposure to parity with other industries, but its enforcement has been indefinitely paused due to a legal challenge. The Trump administration has not actively defended this rule in court, further delaying its implementation and frustrating advocates. Meanwhile, House Democrats are questioning the Department of Labor's enforcement of a rule requiring self-insured coal companies to cover black lung health benefits, fearing that taxpayers will ultimately bear the cost. Representative Morgan McGarvey has introduced bills to streamline the black lung application process and improve benefit access for survivors. Despite these setbacks and delays, advocates remain determined to fight for better protections and benefits for coal miners suffering from this debilitating disease.
