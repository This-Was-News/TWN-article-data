## Article summary
A beloved Los Angeles grocer, Amapola Market, experiences an annual 'masa pilgrimage' during the holiday season, with families lining up for hours to purchase the key ingredient for tamales. This tradition is deeply ingrained in the community, with some customers traveling from as far as Bakersfield and Las Vegas, and others camping overnight to secure their masa. The market's commitment to quality masa is paramount, as evidenced by a past incident where masa made with the wrong corn led to ruined Christmas meals and customer illness. CEO Rolando Pozos emphasizes the responsibility of providing this essential holiday staple, keeping prices stable despite inflation. Families, often involving multiple generations, prepare hundreds of tamales, making the masa's quality and flavor crucial to their cherished traditions. Amapola Market offers a variety of masa flavors, from savory to sweet, and also supplies ingredients for tortillas and champurrado. Employees begin production at 3 a.m. daily to meet the high demand, grinding corn and mixing it with lard and other ingredients in industrial mixers. The market's dedication to tradition and quality has made it a cornerstone of Christmas celebrations for many Los Angeles families, ensuring that tamales remain a central part of their holiday unwrapping, regardless of other gifts.
