## Article summary
The oldest baby boomers are turning 80 in 2026, marking a generation that profoundly influenced American popular culture. Born between 1946 and 1964, approximately 76 million Americans entered the world during this post-World War II boom, fueled by returning soldiers and economic prosperity. This generation, often better educated and wealthier, played a significant role in making popular culture more inclusive and contributed to the growth of a consumer-driven economy. The article presents a quiz with 20 questions to test recall of pop culture from the baby boomer era, covering topics from early television dinners and popular music to iconic movies, television shows, and influential figures. Questions range from identifying the contents of the first Swanson TV dinner and the inventors of Tang, Pop Rocks, and Cool Whip, to recalling astronauts from the Apollo 11 mission and characters from "Gilligan's Island." It also delves into the cultural impact of figures like Bruce Lee, Gloria Steinem, and Muhammad Ali, as well as landmark events such as the "Rumble in the Jungle" and the "Battle of the Sexes." The quiz aims to gauge familiarity with the entertainment, music, and social movements that defined this generation's imprint on society. Answers reveal details about the first TV dinner, inventions, famous astronauts, and catchphrases, among other cultural touchstones. The report acknowledges contributors and provides the author's byline and social media handle.
