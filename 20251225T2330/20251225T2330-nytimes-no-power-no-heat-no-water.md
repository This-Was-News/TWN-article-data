## Article summary
Odesa, Ukraine's largest port, has been subjected to intense Russian shelling for two weeks, causing widespread power, heat, and water outages. Residents like Tetiana Rybak, who is disabled and confined to her apartment, endure terrifying nights listening to explosions and enduring blast waves. For many, the lack of basic utilities has lasted for days, forcing them to find alternative ways to charge devices, cook meals, and keep food cold. Some have organized community efforts, like sharing generator power, while others resort to unconventional methods to maintain essential functions. The attacks are speculated to be retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russia's oil transport fleet. Despite the hardships, many Ukrainians display resilience, though the prolonged outages, especially near holidays, are wearing down patience and optimism. For older residents, the conflict is particularly galling, evoking memories of past shared history with Russia. Social workers are playing a crucial role in supporting vulnerable residents, providing not just material aid but also emotional comfort. The constant threat and disruption have taken a significant psychological toll, leaving many longing for peace and an end to the 'madness.' The war has also separated families, with sons fighting on the front lines and daughters fleeing the country due to the immense stress.
