## Article summary
The Housing First policy, which provides long-term subsidized housing to chronically homeless individuals without requiring treatment for mental illness or addiction, has been a subject of debate, with the Trump administration proposing to limit its funding in favor of treatment-focused alternatives. While extensive research indicates that Housing First is effective in placing individuals in housing, particularly veterans, and has played a role in reducing veteran homelessness significantly, its impact on improving mental or physical health and lowering mortality rates is less consistent. Critics argue that the policy has not adequately addressed underlying issues and has contributed to rising homelessness, while supporters contend that the scarcity of affordable housing is the primary driver of the problem. Studies show that Housing First significantly improves housing stability in the short term, but long-term retention rates can vary, and consistent health benefits have not been proven. Despite the lack of clear evidence for its health benefits, Housing First has been instrumental in the dramatic decrease in veteran homelessness through programs like HUD-VASH. The effectiveness of treatment-first approaches, favored by the administration, has not been as rigorously studied, and direct comparisons suggest Housing First is more successful in housing individuals. The debate over Housing First highlights differing views on what constitutes success and what evidence is most compelling in addressing the complex issue of homelessness, with supporters advocating for scaled-up Housing First programs and critics calling for a broader range of approaches.
