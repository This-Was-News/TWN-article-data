## Article summary
Southern California is experiencing a temporary lull in a massive storm on Christmas Day, but forecasters warn that heavy rain is set to return overnight into Friday. This storm system could bring an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain, with higher amounts in the mountains, potentially causing further flooding. Downtown L.A. has already recorded 9.55 inches of rain this season, making it the seventh wettest on record since 1877. Officials have issued emergency declarations for several counties due to the storm's threats, including flooded streets, washed-out roads, and the risk of debris flows and landslides. Evacuation warnings and orders have been issued for areas near recent burn scars, and communities like Wrightwood are facing significant debris flow and flooding. Authorities are urging residents to minimize travel, never drive through standing water, and pay attention to severe weather warnings, as conditions can be life-threatening. Rainfall totals as of Thursday morning show significant amounts across the region, with coastal and valley areas expected to receive several more inches. Power outages and numerous tree emergencies have also been reported. Meteorologists emphasize that storms of this magnitude occur only once every five to 10 years and that even a small amount of rain can now trigger significant impacts due to the saturated ground.
