## Article summary
Southern California is bracing for another powerful storm system, which is expected to bring more rain and increase the risk of flooding and mudslides. This follows heavy rainfall and winds that have already caused at least two deaths and significant damage. An evacuation warning has been issued for Wrightwood, a mountain town northeast of Los Angeles, due to mudslide risks, with county firefighters actively involved in rescues. Statewide, over 120,000 people are without power. The storms are attributed to atmospheric rivers, bringing much more rain than typically expected for this time of year. In the Sierra Nevada, heavy snow and strong winds are creating treacherous conditions and a high avalanche risk. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency in six counties to facilitate storm response efforts, with state resources and the National Guard on standby. Meanwhile, other parts of the country, including the Midwest and Northeast, are also facing severe weather, with a mix of freezing rain, sleet, and heavy snow expected to disrupt travel and potentially cause power outages.
