## Article summary
Right-wing activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk was fatally shot during an outdoor speaking event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, confirmed his death, stating he was murdered during their 'American Comeback Tour' campus event. President Trump honored Kirk, ordering all American flags to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening. The university reported that a suspect in the shooting is not in custody, and the campus was closed as police escorted people off. Kirk, 31, was hit by a shot fired from a building about 200 yards away. The event was part of Turning Point USA's 'American Comeback Tour,' with Utah Valley University being the first of 15 scheduled stops. Kirk was known for his popular appearances on college campuses. Video circulating on social media appears to show the moment Kirk was shot, though NPR has not verified its authenticity. FBI Director Kash Patel announced that federal agents are heading to the scene and monitoring the situation. This is a developing story.
