A shooting at Evergreen High School on Wednesday, September 10, 2025, left three students critically injured, including the suspected shooter. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office reported that at least two students were shot during the noon hour, with all three critically injured individuals being treated at CommonSpirit St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood. A fourth student was also transported to the hospital, but their injury status is unclear. The shooter used a handgun, and authorities have not found a letter explaining the attack. The school, located about 28 miles southwest of Denver, enrolls approximately 900 students. Parents were asked to reunite with their students at Bergen Meadow Elementary School. Colorado Governor Jared Polis expressed concern and support for the community, while federal law enforcement responded to assist. The Jefferson County Education Association called for meaningful action to end gun violence in schools. All school activities for Wednesday were canceled, and a vigil was planned at Flatirons Community Church in Golden.
