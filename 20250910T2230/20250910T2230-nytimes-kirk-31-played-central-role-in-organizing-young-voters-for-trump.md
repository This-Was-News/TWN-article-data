## Article summary
Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and close ally of President Trump, died at the age of 31 after being shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. President Trump confirmed the death on his social media platform, Truth Social. Kirk was a leading voice among young conservative activists during the Trump era, known for his use of social media and campus organizing to build a following. He had little connection to the Republican establishment and focused on rallying support for Trump-adjacent politicians. By the end of 2024, Kirk was considered a kingmaker, with several of his biggest donors receiving positions in the Trump administration. He was also central in rallying support behind embattled cabinet nominees like Pete Hegseth, who faced accusations of sexual assault. Kirk's death occurred shortly after he took the stage at the event, and he was later declared dead at a hospital.
