## Article summary
Three teens, including the suspected shooter, were critically wounded in a shooting at Evergreen High School in suburban Denver. The incident occurred around 12:30 p.m., with the suspected shooter believed to be a student. The cause of the shooting remains unclear, and no law enforcement officers fired any shots. The shooting took place on school grounds, but the exact location is unknown. All three teens were taken to St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood. Over 100 police officers responded to the scene. The school, with over 900 students, is surrounded by forest. Parents were instructed to reunite with their children at an elementary school. The community was deeply frightened by the event, reminiscent of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting that killed 14 people.
