## Article summary
The Trump administration's revamped SAVE tool has checked the citizenship status of over 33 million voters, raising concerns about data security and accuracy. The system, updated in August, allows election officials to use partial Social Security numbers, names, and birth dates to verify citizenship. While some Republican-led states have embraced SAVE, others express caution due to unresolved questions about data handling and potential misuse. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not addressed concerns from Congress or election officials about data privacy and the system's accuracy. Some states, like Louisiana, have identified a small number of non-citizens on voter rolls, but the overall impact remains minimal. Critics worry about the potential for eligible voters to be wrongly removed from rolls, citing past incidents where citizens were mistakenly purged. Despite assurances from USCIS, there are ongoing concerns about the system's transparency and the long-term storage of voter data. The push for SAVE's use comes amid broader efforts by the Trump administration to tighten election integrity, including controversial demands for voter data from states.
