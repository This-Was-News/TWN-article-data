## Article summary
Decarlos Brown Jr., 34, was charged with causing death on a mass transportation system after allegedly stabbing 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, on a North Carolina commuter train. This incident has become a focal point for the White House's efforts to portray Democratic-led cities as havens for violent criminals. Brown had a lengthy criminal history, with multiple missed opportunities for intervention, including a delayed mental health evaluation following a January misdemeanor arrest. Court records show Brown was initially charged in 2014 with being a felon in possession of a firearm, but federal prosecutors did not take the case, and the state charge was dropped. The Justice Department's recent filing is Brown's first federal charge, which, along with a state charge of first-degree murder, could carry the death penalty. Video evidence shows Zarutska sitting near Brown before he suddenly stabbed her without apparent provocation. The Trump administration has used Brown's case to criticize Democrats for what they claim is out-of-control crime in blue cities. Experts suggest there were multiple failed opportunities to address Brown's mental health and criminal behavior earlier. Brown's mother sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment after he became violent at home, and he was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, obtaining such commitments is often difficult, as courts must find the individual to be a danger to themselves or others.
