## Article summary
NATO allies convened Article 4 consultations following a Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace and the subsequent shooting down of some drones by Polish and Dutch fighter jets. These talks were held at NATO headquarters as part of a regular meeting of ambassadors from the alliance's 32 member states. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that the consultations were conducted under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which was founded in 1949. Article 4 mandates consultations among NATO members when any member perceives a threat to its territorial integrity, political independence, or security. Analyst Bob Deen explained that Article 4 aims to enhance coordination and understanding within the alliance regarding external threats. Poland has previously invoked Article 4 during Russia's war on Ukraine, but such consultations do not automatically lead to action under Article 5, NATO's collective security guarantee. Article 4 has been invoked relatively rarely but more frequently in recent years, with Turkey invoking it five times between 2003 and 2020. Poland first invoked Article 4 in 2014 following Russian aggression in Ukraine and again in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion. Deen clarified that Article 4 is related to but not necessarily a precursor to Article 5, which has only been invoked once, in response to the 9/11 attacks on the United States.
