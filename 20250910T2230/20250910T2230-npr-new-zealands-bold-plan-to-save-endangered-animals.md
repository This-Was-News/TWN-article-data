## Article summary
New Zealand is embarking on an ambitious conservation project, Predator Free 2050, aiming to eradicate invasive predators by 2050 to save its endangered native birds, including the flightless kiwi. Invasive species, introduced by European settlers, have decimated native bird populations, with 62 species already extinct and over 80 percent of remaining breeding birds at risk. The project involves killing tens of millions of non-native animals, including stoats, rats, and possums, which prey on native birds. Conservation efforts include trapping and poisoning, with some success in offshore islands and community-led initiatives. However, the task is daunting, requiring new technology and widespread public support. Critics debate the feasibility and ethics of the project, with some advocating for more focused conservation efforts. Despite challenges, New Zealand remains committed to preserving its unique biodiversity.
