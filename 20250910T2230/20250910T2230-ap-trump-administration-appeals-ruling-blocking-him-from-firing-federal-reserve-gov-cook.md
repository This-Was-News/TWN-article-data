## Article summary
The Trump administration appealed a ruling that blocked President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The appeal followed a decision by U.S. District Judge Jan Cobb, which the White House contested, arguing Trump has the right to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook's lawyers contend that her removal is unlawful, as presidents can only fire Fed governors for cause, such as poor performance or misconduct. The judge ruled that the president's removal power is limited to actions taken during a governor's time in office. Cook denies the mortgage fraud allegations but maintains she should have had the opportunity to respond before being fired. Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates more quickly and aims to gain a 4-3 majority on the Fed's governing board by replacing Cook. No president has previously sought to fire a Fed governor, and economists generally support independent central banks for their ability to make unpopular decisions, like raising interest rates to combat inflation. Cook is scheduled to participate in a Fed meeting next week, where a quarter-point reduction in the key short-term rate is expected.
