## Article summary
Three senior FBI agents have filed a lawsuit alleging that the Trump administration launched a campaign of retribution against them for not demonstrating loyalty to President Trump. The lawsuit claims that FBI Director Kash Patel and leaders within the FBI and Justice Department acted in a partisan manner, dismissing agents who crossed Trump. The three plaintiffs, including Bran Driscoll, Steven Jensen, and Spencer Evans, are highly decorated agents with extensive experience in national security and counterterrorism. They allege their dismissals violated their Fifth and First Amendment rights. The lawsuit details instances of political interference, including pressure to provide lists of agents involved in investigations related to Trump and his supporters. The agents' dismissals are seen as part of a broader effort to reshape the FBI and Justice Department according to Trump's political agenda. The FBI declined to comment on the lawsuit.
