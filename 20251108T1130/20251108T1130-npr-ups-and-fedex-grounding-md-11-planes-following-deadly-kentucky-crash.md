## Article summary
Following a deadly crash of a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 plane at its global aviation hub in Kentucky, UPS and FedEx have announced they will ground their fleets of this aircraft type out of an abundance of caution. The decision was made proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997. The crash on Tuesday at UPS Worldport in Louisville killed 14 people, including the three pilots. National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman stated that a bell sounded in the cockpit shortly after the crew called for takeoff thrust, and for the next 25 seconds, the pilots attempted to control the aircraft as its left wing blazed and an engine detached before it crashed. Investigators are working to determine the cause of the bell and the subsequent events, with a full transcript of the cockpit recording expected months from now. A former federal crash investigator suggested the bell likely indicated an engine fire, occurring at a point past the pilots' decision speed to abort the takeoff. Dramatic video footage captured the crash, providing investigators with evidence from multiple angles. The MD-11 involved in the crash, built in 1991, had undergone maintenance in San Antonio for over a month until mid-October. UPS Worldport, the company's largest package handling facility, resumed operations Wednesday night.
