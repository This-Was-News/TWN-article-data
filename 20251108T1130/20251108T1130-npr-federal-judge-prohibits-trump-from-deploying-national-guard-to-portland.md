## Article summary
A federal judge has permanently blocked President Trump from deploying the National Guard to Portland. U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut ruled that President Trump did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard for the ongoing protests outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. While acknowledging that violent protests occurred, the judge noted that law enforcement was able to address them and that subsequent protests have been predominantly peaceful. This decision marks the fourth time Immergut has blocked the deployment and is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts. The city of Portland and the states of Oregon and California had sued, arguing the executive branch exceeded its constitutional authority and violated state sovereignty. The judge clarified that her ruling does not prevent future deployments if conditions truly warrant intervention. Legal experts anticipate an appeal, but political leaders have hailed the decision as a check on presidential power. The case also highlighted discrepancies in the administration's justifications for the deployment, including the number of federal officers sent to the city. The ruling underscores the legal limitations on the president's authority to federalize the National Guard.
