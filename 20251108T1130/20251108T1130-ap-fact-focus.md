## Article summary
President Donald Trump has claimed that Thanksgiving dinner will cost 25% less this year, citing a prepackaged meal basket from Walmart. However, this claim is misleading because the Walmart basket for 2025 contains fewer items and different products compared to the 2024 basket, making it not an "apples to apples" comparison. The 2025 Walmart basket costs under $40 for 10 people, while the 2024 basket cost approximately $56 for eight people. This year's basket includes 15 items, down from 29 last year, omitting several dessert and savory components. Substitutions have also been made, such as different brands of fried onions and fewer dinner rolls. While some retailers are indeed offering lower prices, the overall cost of Thanksgiving dinner is more complex. A Wells Fargo report suggests a 2-3% fall in the cost of a 10-person meal, depending on brand choices. Conversely, other reports indicate that wholesale turkey prices have risen significantly, with retail prices also being higher than last year. Economists suggest that retailers like Walmart, which contract turkeys in advance, can offer lower prices to consumers despite market fluctuations. Other retailers like Lidl, Aldi, and Schnucks are also advertising lower Thanksgiving meal prices, though comparisons can be difficult due to product variations.
