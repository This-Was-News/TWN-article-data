## Article summary
Following a deadly crash of one of its MD-11 planes in Kentucky, UPS and FedEx have decided to ground their fleets of this aircraft type as a precautionary measure. The crash, which occurred at the UPS Worldport in Louisville, resulted in the deaths of three pilots. MD-11 aircraft represent a small percentage of both UPS and FedEx's fleets. UPS stated the decision was made proactively based on the aircraft manufacturer's recommendation, emphasizing safety. FedEx is also conducting a thorough safety review. Boeing, which acquired McDonnell Douglas, has not yet disclosed the reason for the recommendation. Western Global Airlines is the only other U.S. cargo airline flying MD-11s, with most of its fleet already in storage. Boeing had previously announced plans to phase out MD-11 production. The investigation into the UPS crash revealed that a bell sounded in the cockpit during takeoff, followed by attempts to control the aircraft as it caught fire and lost an engine. Investigators are working to determine the cause of the bell and the subsequent events. The crashed UPS MD-11 had undergone maintenance prior to the incident. UPS Worldport, the company's largest hub, has resumed operations after the crash.
