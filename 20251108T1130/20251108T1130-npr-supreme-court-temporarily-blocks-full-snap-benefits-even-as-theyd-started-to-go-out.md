## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the distribution of full SNAP benefits, even as some states had already begun issuing them. This decision came as the Trump administration appealed a lower court order to fully restart the anti-hunger program. The Supreme Court's intervention allows a lower court more time to consider a more permanent pause, potentially adding to confusion for recipients. States had started issuing full benefits after a federal judge ruled against the administration's plan for partial payments, citing the "needless suffering" it would cause. The administration argued it lacked emergency funds due to the government shutdown and that Congress should provide more funding. The Supreme Court's action means states must revert to distributing partial payments as previously instructed. Funding for SNAP, which serves nearly 42 million people, had run out during the ongoing federal shutdown. Advocacy groups criticized the administration for delaying action until a court order forced their hand. The appeals court is expected to issue a decision on the administration's request for a stay as quickly as possible.
