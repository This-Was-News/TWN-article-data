## Article summary
The Trump administration, through the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service, is implementing new rules that provide substantial tax breaks to large corporations and wealthy individuals. These actions are largely occurring with minimal public attention and are estimated to amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in tax relief. A primary target of these new regulations is the corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT), a provision enacted in 2022 to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some federal income tax. The Treasury's new notices and proposed regulations significantly reduce the expected revenue from this tax, potentially bringing in a fraction of the projected $222 billion over a decade. These breaks are in addition to the roughly $4 trillion in tax cuts signed into law by President Trump in July 2017, which also heavily favored businesses and the wealthy. Tax experts suggest these actions may exceed the administration's legal authority, with some calling them unlegislated tax cuts. The Treasury argues these changes support American investment and competitiveness by replacing what they describe as the Biden administration's complex compliance rules. The agency's actions are seen as an accelerated version of previous efforts to reduce tax burdens on large businesses and wealthy individuals. Specific beneficiaries include private equity firms, crypto companies, foreign real estate investors, and insurance providers, who are applauding the increased flexibility in calculating their tax liabilities. For example, Cheniere Energy disclosed it was entitled to a $380 million refund due to the new rules, and crypto firms like Strategy announced they would no longer be subject to the minimum tax.
