## Article summary
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is rapidly expanding its surveillance capabilities with new technologies designed to identify and track individuals. These tools include mobile apps that can identify people by their faces and scan irises, as well as software that accesses location-based data. ICE has also revived a contract for spyware capable of hacking cell phones and is increasing its social media surveillance with AI-driven software. This technological push aims to support the Trump administration's goal of increasing deportations. Concerns have been raised by Democratic members of Congress and privacy advocates regarding the legal basis and oversight of these technologies. Critics argue that these tools erode privacy and could lead to mass surveillance, potentially chilling free speech and undermining democratic principles. A recent incident in Illinois reportedly showed Border Patrol agents using a cell phone to attempt to identify a minor. ICE maintains that these technologies are used to fight crime and respect civil liberties, while the Department of Homeland Security states that all tools comply with requirements and oversight frameworks. The proposed expansion of biometric data collection from noncitizens and their relatives further fuels these privacy debates. The use of advanced spyware, like that from Paragon Solutions, raises further concerns about its potential misuse against journalists and civil society members, with legal groups suing for more information.
