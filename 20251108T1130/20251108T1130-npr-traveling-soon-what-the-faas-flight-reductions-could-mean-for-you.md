## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is implementing flight reductions at 40 of the nation's busiest airports due to the ongoing government shutdown and its impact on air traffic controllers working without pay. These reductions, starting at 4% and potentially increasing to 10% (approximately 4,400 flights daily), aim to alleviate pressure on staffing-short controllers. Major airlines like United, Delta, and Alaska are offering increased flexibility for passengers to change or refund tickets, even if their flights are not canceled. International flights and flights between hub airports are generally unaffected. Travelers are advised to download airline apps, enable notifications, and remain flexible, as cancellations are likely to impact flights with smaller planes or those on less critical routes. Passengers on canceled or significantly delayed flights are entitled to a full refund if they decline rebooking options, and many airlines are waiving change fees. While rescheduling trips might be advisable for those with flexible plans, travelers should book Thanksgiving flights soon, considering refundable tickets or travel insurance, though standard policies may not cover disruptions from the current shutdown. The situation remains fluid, with airlines updating their policies, and a swift resolution to the shutdown is hoped to prevent major issues during the busy Thanksgiving travel period.
