## Article summary
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has temporarily blocked a court order that would have compelled the Trump administration to fully fund food stamps. This administrative stay, issued late Friday, aims to give an appeals court more time to consider the legal arguments surrounding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding during the federal shutdown. The move adds to the uncertainty for the nation's largest anti-hunger program. Several states, including New York, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Oregon, had already begun releasing full benefits to residents. The Agriculture Department had also suggested it might make funds available. However, it remains unclear how Justice Jackson's temporary hold will impact these payments or if SNAP benefits could face future delays or cuts. Justice Jackson, responsible for emergency applications from her region, stated her expectation for a swift ruling from the appeals court. Despite this, many Democrats expressed anger, accusing President Trump of using nutrition assistance as a bargaining chip during the government shutdown. The program is relied upon by one in eight Americans.
