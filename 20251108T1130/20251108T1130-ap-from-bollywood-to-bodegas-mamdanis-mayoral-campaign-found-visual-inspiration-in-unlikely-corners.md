## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani's mayoral campaign in New York City utilized distinctive blue and orange signs with bold lettering, drawing inspiration from old-school Bollywood posters and the vibrant colors of New York's bodegas and small businesses. Graphic designer Aneesh Bhoopathy aimed to evoke a retro, hand-painted feel that represented the essence of New York. This unique aesthetic stood out from traditional campaign visuals, even prompting a rebranding by his opponent, Andrew Cuomo, who adopted similar colors. Mamdani, the son of prominent Indian American figures, and his campaign's visual identity were seen as reflecting the city's working-class fabric and cultural richness. Experts noted the retro vibe could foster positive associations with earlier, less divisive political times. The branding also drew comparisons to that of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another progressive New Yorker known for her distinctive campaign design. While difficult to quantify its exact impact, the visuals made Mamdani recognizable and memorable in a crowded field. The playfulness of the design encouraged supporters to engage and share, making politics feel community-driven. Ultimately, the lesson from Mamdani's visual success is that effective branding is specific and deliberate, standing out by having meaning rather than being generic or safe.
