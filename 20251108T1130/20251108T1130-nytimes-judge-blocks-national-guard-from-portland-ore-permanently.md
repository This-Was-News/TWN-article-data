## Article summary
A federal judge has permanently blocked President Trump's order to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the Trump administration overstepped its authority and failed to prove that protests were hindering federal policies. The judge found that the attempt to use National Guard soldiers violated the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment. She also disputed the president's claim that antifa is an organized group working against the federal government in Portland. Evidence presented did not convincingly show that protests were significantly disruptive or dangerous to federal workers. The ruling does not prevent future presidential efforts to deploy the National Guard to Oregon. Federal lawyers indicated they intend to appeal the decision, and the judge stayed her ruling for 14 days to maintain the status quo. Oregon's governor praised the decision, calling the federalization of the guard an abuse of power. The Department of Homeland Security, however, disagreed with the judge's characterization of the protests, stating the president is using lawful authority to protect federal assets. Protests outside the ICE building began in June and have generally been small and peaceful, though occasional confrontations have occurred.
