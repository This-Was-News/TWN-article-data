## Article summary
The Trump administration is requesting a federal appeals court to block a judge's order that would have compelled the distribution of full November SNAP benefits during a government shutdown. This move comes despite some states already issuing these crucial food assistance payments. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program serves approximately one in eight Americans, primarily those with lower incomes. The administration argues that forcing the release of full benefits would exceed available funds and encroach upon Congress's power to appropriate money. A federal judge had previously ordered the government to use an emergency reserve fund to cover the full November payments, rejecting the administration's plan for partial benefits. Some states, including California, Wisconsin, and Oregon, acted swiftly to ensure recipients received their full benefits. However, many SNAP recipients faced uncertainty and had to rely on food pantries while awaiting their payments. The legal battle highlights the significant impact of the government shutdown on vulnerable populations. The Department of Justice has stated that courts cannot appropriate or spend money, challenging the judicial order. Attorneys for those suing the administration argue that the government has sufficient funds and should not delay vital assistance. Different states are adopting varied approaches to distributing food aid, with some expecting full benefits to arrive over the weekend or early next week.
