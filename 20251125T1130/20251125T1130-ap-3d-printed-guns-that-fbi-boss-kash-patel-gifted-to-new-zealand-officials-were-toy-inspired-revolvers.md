## Article summary
FBI Director Kash Patel gifted inoperable 3D-printed revolvers to senior New Zealand security officials, which were later surrendered for destruction as they were illegal to possess. These pistols, identified as the Maverick PG22 model, were inspired by toy Nerf guns and are popular among amateur 3D-printed weapons hobbyists. Documents obtained by the Associated Press reveal that experts believe these guns could be easily made operable with common tools. New Zealand has strict gun laws, and even inoperable weapons are considered functional if they can be modified. The Maverick PG22 is among the most common 3D-printed guns seized by New Zealand police. Five officials, including police chiefs and intelligence agency directors, received the gifts. They voluntarily surrendered the revolvers, and the police commissioner denied a request to keep one for testing, leading to their destruction. The New Zealand Police refused to release photos of the guns, citing potential harm to relations with the United States. The country has significantly strengthened its gun control measures since the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, viewing gun ownership as a privilege rather than a right.
