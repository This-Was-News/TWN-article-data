## Article summary
The Pentagon has initiated an investigation into Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a retired Navy pilot and astronaut, for alleged violations of military law. This action follows Kelly's appearance in a video with other Democratic lawmakers urging military and intelligence personnel to refuse "illegal orders." The Pentagon stated that a thorough review is underway to determine further actions, which could include recall to active duty for court-martial. The investigation comes amid legal questions surrounding the Trump administration's actions, including troop deployments and airstrikes. The video, which also featured several other members of Congress with military backgrounds, emphasized that soldiers can refuse unlawful commands. President Trump publicly condemned the video as "seditious behavior," initially suggesting it was punishable by death, though he later clarified he was not issuing a death threat. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that inciting defiance of lawful orders is dangerous and should be held accountable. House Speaker Mike Johnson also criticized the lawmakers' statements. Senator Kelly, upon learning of the Pentagon's investigation, stated it would not intimidate him from his duties. Experts suggest recalling a retired senator to active duty for court-martial is exceedingly rare and politically charged, with constitutional protections for speech made during official duties potentially complicating the matter.
