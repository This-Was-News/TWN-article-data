## Article summary
A federal judge has dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The judge ruled that Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney who secured the indictments, was unlawfully appointed. This decision is a significant setback for efforts to prosecute perceived political enemies of the president. Judge Currie stated that all actions stemming from Halligan's appointment, including the indictments, were unlawful. The cases were dismissed without prejudice, allowing the Justice Department to potentially refile them. The White House expressed disagreement with the ruling, calling it an "unprecedented action" to shield Comey and James from accountability. Halligan, a former personal lawyer for the president with no prior prosecutorial experience, was appointed after the previous prosecutor expressed doubts about the cases. Comey's attorney stated that the indictment was void and the statute of limitations had run, preventing further charges. James's attorney echoed this, claiming the appointment was an extreme measure to target his client. In both cases, Halligan was the sole prosecutor presenting to the grand jury.
