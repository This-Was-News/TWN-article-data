## Article summary
Russia launched a wave of overnight attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulting in at least six fatalities and damage to residential buildings and energy infrastructure. Simultaneously, a Ukrainian attack on southern Russia claimed three lives and damaged homes. These events occurred amidst renewed U.S. efforts to broker a peace plan, with Army Secretary Dan Driscoll meeting Russian officials in Abu Dhabi. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed optimism about progress in recent talks and planned discussions with President Donald Trump. However, an elderly resident of a damaged Kyiv building voiced despair, stating, "Putin wont stop until he finishes us off." French President Emmanuel Macron supported the U.S. peace plan but cautioned against a "capitulation" that would allow Russia to renew hostilities, emphasizing the need for robust security guarantees for Ukraine. Russian officials have been reserved in their comments, while European leaders acknowledge the long road to peace. The Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's Rostov region was the fourth-largest on record.
