## Article summary
This Black Friday is poised to offer some of the deepest discounts in years as retailers aim to attract shoppers feeling anxious about the economy. Despite concerns over tariffs and the cost of living, Americans are expected to spend over $1 trillion on holiday gifts, food, and decorations for the first time, according to the National Retail Federation. While some forecasts predict more modest growth, the season is shaping up to be better than initially feared. Shoppers are becoming more discerning, prioritizing quality and value, often skipping smaller, impulse purchases in favor of one or two significant items. This choosiness is prompting stores to prepare for substantial sales, with deeper discounts anticipated on items like clothing, electronics, and toys. Although consumer sentiment remains cautious due to worries about affordability and jobs, people are motivated to celebrate the holidays and are utilizing options like Buy Now Pay Later to manage spending. Retailers have also strategically managed inventory and costs, mitigating the impact of tariffs. Ultimately, consumers are seeking a holiday reprieve and are willing to spend for special occasions, even while trying not to overspend.
