## Article summary
New limits on federal student loans for medical and nursing school could significantly impact the pipeline of future healthcare professionals, health educators warn. The Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful" legislation, set to take effect next July, will cap annual borrowing for medical students at $50,000 and $200,000 over four years, with even stricter limits for nursing and public health fields. This move is expected to disproportionately affect students from lower-income and underrepresented backgrounds, potentially leading to a less diverse healthcare workforce. Educators express concern that these financial barriers will discourage many aspiring doctors and nurses, exacerbating existing shortages. Furthermore, recent changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program add further complexity, making it harder for healthcare workers in certain roles to have their student debt erased. While proponents argue these limits will pressure universities to lower tuition, many in the education sector doubt this outcome. The potential reduction in diversity in healthcare is a major concern, as research indicates a diverse workforce improves patient outcomes through better communication and understanding. This comes on the heels of a Supreme Court ruling that already impacted minority enrollment in medical schools, raising further worries about access and equity in the healthcare field.
