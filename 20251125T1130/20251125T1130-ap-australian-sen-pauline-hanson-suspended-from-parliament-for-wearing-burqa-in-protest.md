## Article summary
Australian Senator Pauline Hanson has been suspended from Parliament for the remainder of the year after wearing a burqa in the Senate chamber. Hanson, leader of the anti-immigration One Nation party, staged the protest to advocate for a national ban on full-face coverings in public places. Senators voted to censure her, resulting in a suspension that will extend into February next year when Parliament resumes. Hanson stated she would face judgment from voters in 2028, not her colleagues, and criticized the hypocrisy of denying her the right to wear the garment when there is no specific dress code for the Senate floor. This incident follows a similar protest in 2017 where Hanson wore a burqa but was not punished. Government leader Penny Wong condemned Hanson's actions as mocking and vilifying an entire faith, arguing it weakens Australia and harms vulnerable communities. Other senators, including Mehreen Faruqi, called for addressing systemic racism. Hanson has a history of controversial statements on race and immigration, including a past comment about being "in danger of being swamped by Asians." She is also appealing a ruling that she breached a racial anti-discrimination law.
