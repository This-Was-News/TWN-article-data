## Article summary
The Trump administration is acquiring billions of dollars in ownership stakes in private companies deemed crucial for national security, a strategy that has already committed over $10 billion in taxpayer funds. This unusual approach involves minority stakes, or options for future stakes, in at least nine companies across sectors like steel, minerals, nuclear energy, and semiconductors, with most deals occurring in October and November. The primary driver for these investments is national security, aiming to bolster strategic industries and reduce American dependence on foreign nations, particularly China, for essential resources. While some officials anticipate financial windfalls for taxpayers, the profitability of these companies is uncertain, as many are currently facing financial challenges and may take years to become profitable. This significant government intervention in the private market has raised concerns regarding the lack of transparency, potential for favoritism and corruption, market distortions, and the risk of taxpayer losses if investments fail. Experts question whether this government involvement will effectively address national security vulnerabilities and yield returns on public funds.
