## Article summary
A federal judge has dismissed the criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The judge, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, ruled that the prosecutor who brought the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was illegally appointed by the Justice Department at President Donald Trump's urging. This ruling does not address the substance of the allegations but focuses on the improper appointment of Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Currie stated that all actions stemming from Halligan's "defective appointment" were unlawful. The Justice Department has vowed to appeal the decision, and prosecutors may attempt to refile the charges. Both Comey and James have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Comey faces charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, while James is accused of mortgage fraud. The challenges to Halligan's appointment are part of broader efforts by the defense to dismiss the cases, arguing they are vindictive. Comey expressed gratitude for the dismissal, calling the prosecution "malevolence and incompetence." James stated she was "heartened by today's victory." The ruling highlights the controversial method used by the Trump administration to appoint Halligan, who had no prior prosecutorial experience. The Justice Department's attempt to protect the indictments by giving Halligan a separate "Special Attorney" position was also rejected by the judge.
