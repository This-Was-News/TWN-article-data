## Article summary
A growing number of farm animal sanctuaries are offering an alternative Thanksgiving tradition: turkey adoptions. Instead of being a holiday meal, families can adopt turkeys by donating to their care, receiving photos, certificates, and sometimes even visits with the birds in return. This initiative aims to spare some of the millions of turkeys slaughtered annually, many from factory farms with allegedly inhumane conditions. Sanctuaries like Luvin Arms in Colorado have seen their sponsorship programs double each year, with donations funding pasture expansion, food, rescue efforts, and veterinary care. The program also serves an educational purpose, highlighting the conditions in factory farms and the sentience of turkeys. Farm Sanctuary, a pioneer in this movement since 1986, has rescued thousands of turkeys and seen significant public support. Other sanctuaries, such as Barn Sanctuary, also emphasize the unique personalities and loving nature of turkeys, aiming to shift public perception beyond them being just a holiday centerpiece. These adoption programs encourage a reconsideration of traditional holiday practices and foster a greater appreciation for animal welfare.
