## Article summary
A federal judge has dismissed criminal charges against former F.B.I. director James Comey and New York's attorney general, Letitia James. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled that the prosecutor appointed by President Trump to bring these cases, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed. This decision represents a significant setback for President Trump's efforts to use the criminal justice system against perceived opponents. The dismissals are also seen as a rebuke to Attorney General Pam Bondi for her role in appointing Ms. Halligan. Judge Currie's rulings centered on President Trump's decision to appoint Ms. Halligan in an interim capacity. Ms. Halligan, shortly after assuming her post, indicted both Mr. Comey and Ms. James, overriding the advice of career prosecutors. While these dismissals are embarrassing for the White House, the possibility remains that another prosecutor could refile the charges, and the issue of constitutional authority may be appealed to the Supreme Court.
