## Article summary
President Trump imposed a deadline for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept a 28-point peace deal with Russia, threatening to leave Ukraine to fight alone if he refused. By Thanksgiving Day, the deadline had passed, and the plan was reduced to about 20 points. Sensitive issues like military size limits, NATO troop presence, and border demarcations were postponed for future talks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led 11 hours of negotiations in Geneva to modify the draft. However, some Trump administration officials anticipate that Russia may reject the revised proposal, potentially leading to prolonged negotiations that Trump aimed to avoid. Rubio acknowledged that Russia's approval is crucial for the plan's success.
