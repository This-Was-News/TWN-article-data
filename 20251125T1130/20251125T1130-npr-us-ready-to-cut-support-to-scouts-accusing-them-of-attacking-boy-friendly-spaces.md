## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is preparing to end the U.S. military's century-old partnership with Scouting America, formerly the Boy Scouts. Documents obtained by NPR indicate Hegseth believes the organization has strayed from its mission, becoming "genderless" and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, which he argues attacks "boy-friendly spaces." The proposed severing of ties would halt medical and logistical aid to the National Jamboree and prohibit Scout troops from meeting on military installations worldwide. This move would impact military recruiting efforts, as a significant percentage of cadets and midshipmen at service academies have scouting backgrounds. The military's support for the Scouts, formalized in 1937, has included providing resources for the Jamboree and allowing troop meetings on bases, which also serves as a community engagement tool. Hegseth intends to invoke a clause allowing him to withhold support if it's deemed "detrimental to national security," citing diverted resources and a perceived lack of "masculine values." Scouting America has expressed pride in its military affiliation and a desire to continue the partnership, emphasizing its nonpartisan nature and focus on leadership development. Some within the Pentagon, like Navy Secretary John Phelan, have expressed concerns that cutting ties could be detrimental to recruitment efforts. The Pentagon has not officially commented on the "leaked documents," calling them potentially pre-decisional. The decision comes amid ongoing discussions about the organization's transformation, including its name change and welcoming of girls.
