## Article summary
The U.S. national debt surpassed $38 trillion during a federal government shutdown, marking the fastest accumulation of $1 trillion in debt outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest Treasury Department report highlights this record, which raises concerns about inflation and its impact on future generations. Experts warn that rising debt could lead to higher borrowing costs, lower wages, and more expensive goods and services. The Trump administration claims its policies are reducing the deficit, with a cumulative deficit of $468 billion from April to September, the lowest since 2019. The Joint Economic Committee estimates the national debt has grown by nearly $70,000 per second over the past year. Michael Peterson of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation notes that increasing debt leads to higher interest costs, which crowd out important investments. The debt milestones include reaching $34 trillion in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024, and $36 trillion in November 2024.
