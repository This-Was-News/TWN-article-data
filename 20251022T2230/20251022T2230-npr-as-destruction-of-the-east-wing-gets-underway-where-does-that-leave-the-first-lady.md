## Article summary
The East Wing of the White House is currently being demolished to make way for a new ballroom, sparking debate and concern from preservationists. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has called for a pause on construction, insisting that the plans should undergo a public review process. The White House argues that demolition does not fall under the same regulations as construction. Historians, including Kate Andersen Brower, express pain at seeing the demolition, noting that the East Wing has traditionally housed the offices of the first lady. The last major renovation of the White House occurred during Harry Truman's presidency, funded by taxpayers. The current project, estimated at $200 million, is intended to be privately funded, raising ethical concerns about the sources and intentions behind the donations. Historical artifacts from the East Wing, including items from Rosalyn Carter's office, have been preserved. The necessity and size of the new ballroom are also subjects of debate, with critics questioning the proportionality and need for such a large space.
