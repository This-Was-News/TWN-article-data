## Article summary
North Carolina lawmakers approved a revised U.S. House map supported by President Donald Trump, aiming to secure an additional Republican seat. The new map alters the state's sole swing district, held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis, by adding more Republican voters along the coast and shifting inland voters to a neighboring Republican district. The GOP already controls 10 of North Carolina's 14 House seats, and the revised map cannot be vetoed by Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, though legal challenges are anticipated. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is facing criticism for its handling of various issues, including strikes on alleged drug vessels, the construction of a new White House ballroom, and proposed tariffs on beef imports from Argentina. Additionally, the government shutdown has led to delays in food assistance and protests by Democratic senators, including a lengthy speech by Sen. Jeff Merkley. The administration is also preparing for potential meetings with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and is dealing with international tensions involving Russia, North Korea, and Israel.
