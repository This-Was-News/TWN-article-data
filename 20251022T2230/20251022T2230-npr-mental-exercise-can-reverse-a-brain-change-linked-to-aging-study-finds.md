## Article summary
A new study reveals that cognitive training can boost levels of acetylcholine, a brain chemical crucial for decision-making and attention, which typically declines with age. The 10-week study involved individuals aged 65 and older who engaged in rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes daily. Participants who used the BrainHQ program, designed to enhance attention and processing speed, showed a 2.3% increase in acetylcholine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, effectively reversing age-related decline. This increase is significant, as acetylcholine levels normally decrease by 2.5% per decade with aging. The study suggests that cognitive training can turn back the clock by about 10 years in this brain area. The findings align with previous research indicating that brain-stimulating environments can increase neurotransmitter levels. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and comes amid a rise in online brain-training programs, though their effectiveness has been debated. The research team used PET scans to detect changes in acetylcholine levels, finding significant increases in those who did cognitive training compared to those who played games like solitaire. Even modest increases in acetylcholine can have profound effects on memory, learning, and attention, highlighting the potential of cognitive training to stave off cognitive decline.
