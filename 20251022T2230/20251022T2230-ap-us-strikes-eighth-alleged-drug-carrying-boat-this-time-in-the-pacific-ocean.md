## Article summary
The U.S. military conducted its eighth strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean, marking an expansion of the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking in South America. The strike, which killed two people, is part of a broader effort to disrupt drug smuggling routes, particularly those involving cocaine from Colombia and Peru. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth compared the campaign to the war on terrorism, asserting that drug cartels are waging war on the U.S. border. President Trump has justified the strikes by declaring an armed conflict with drug cartels, relying on legal authorities similar to those used in the war on terrorism. The strikes have raised concerns from lawmakers on both sides, who question the lack of congressional authorization and transparency. The U.S. military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean and off the coast of Venezuela, fueling speculation about potential actions against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The administration has faced criticism for not prosecuting survivors of the strikes and for the lack of clarity in its legal justifications. Despite these concerns, the Senate recently voted down a Democratic resolution that would have required presidential authorization for further strikes.
