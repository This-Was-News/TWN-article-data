## Article summary
The Trump administration has expanded its campaign of striking boats suspected of drug smuggling to the eastern Pacific Ocean, marking the eighth known attack and the first outside the Caribbean. The latest strike, off the coast of Colombia, killed two people and was part of an operation that has resulted in 34 deaths since September. The administration justifies these actions as self-defense against narco-terrorists, but critics argue the campaign is illegal and targets civilians. The strikes have caused regional turmoil, with Colombia's president accusing the U.S. of murder and survivors being repatriated without charges. The administration has designated numerous Latin American drug cartels as terrorist organizations, a move contested by experts. The majority of cocaine smuggled into the U.S. comes through the Pacific, but the administration's focus has largely been on Venezuela. The legitimacy and legal basis of these strikes remain contentious.
