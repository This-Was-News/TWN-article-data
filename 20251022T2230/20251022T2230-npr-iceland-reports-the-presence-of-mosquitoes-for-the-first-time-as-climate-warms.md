## Article summary
Iceland has reported the presence of mosquitoes for the first time in its history. Three *Culiseta annulata* mosquitoes were discovered in Kjós, north of Reykjavík. The Natural Science Institute of Iceland confirmed the findings, suggesting the mosquitoes likely arrived via freight and can tolerate Iceland's climate. This discovery is part of a trend of new insect species appearing in Iceland due to climate change and increased international transportation. The mosquitoes were found by an insect enthusiast, Björn Hjaltason, who noticed their unusual presence. While these mosquitoes can sting, they do not carry known infections in the regions where they are typically found. Climate change is causing global temperatures to rise, with the Arctic warming at more than double the global average. Antarctica remains the only place believed to be free of mosquitoes. There are over 3,000 mosquito species worldwide, some of which can transmit serious diseases like malaria and dengue fever.
