## Article summary
A federal judge in Chicago has indefinitely blocked the deployment of National Guard troops, pending further legal decisions. This ruling comes as the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to allow the deployment, with ongoing legal battles in multiple states. In California, an appeals court is reviewing Governor Gavin Newsom's challenge to the troop deployment in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, in Oregon, a judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops, with appeals and hearings scheduled. The Justice Department is pushing for an emergency order from the Supreme Court to allow the deployments. Legal challenges are also underway in West Virginia, Washington D.C., and Tennessee, with varying levels of support from state governors and officials. The deployments are part of Trump's efforts to use the military in Democratic-led cities, despite objections from local mayors and governors. The legal landscape is complex, with multiple court rulings and appeals shaping the outcome. The National Guard's role in domestic law enforcement is a central issue, with the Posse Comitatus Act being cited in some cases.
