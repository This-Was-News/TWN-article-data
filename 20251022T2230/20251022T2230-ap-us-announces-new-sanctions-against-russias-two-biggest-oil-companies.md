## Article summary
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced new sanctions against Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, due to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. The sanctions were imposed following months of bipartisan pressure and aim to cut off funding for the Kremlin's military efforts. The announcement came as NATO coordinated weapons deliveries to Ukraine and Russian drones and missiles struck multiple Ukrainian cities, killing and injuring civilians, including children. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for more foreign military aid and urged international pressure on Russia through sanctions and coordinated diplomacy. Meanwhile, efforts to end the war, including a proposed summit between Trump and Putin, have faced obstacles. Zelenskyy also signed an agreement with Sweden to explore the purchase of Swedish fighter jets. The Russian attacks targeted energy infrastructure, causing power outages and damage to residential buildings in Kyiv. The Ukrainian military reported striking key Russian industrial sites, while Russia claimed to have downed Ukrainian drones.
