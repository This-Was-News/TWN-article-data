## Article summary
The University of Virginia has reached an agreement with the Trump administration to avoid a federal investigation into civil rights violations. This deal, announced by the Justice Department, is the first of its kind between the administration and a public university. The agreement comes after the university faced pressure from the White House, particularly following the resignation of President James E. Ryan in June. The deal allows the university to maintain its autonomy and research funding partnership with the government. Under the terms, the university will adhere to the administration's interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision on race in admissions. The university will provide quarterly updates to the Justice Department on its compliance, avoiding the need for an independent monitor. The agreement aims to protect students and faculty from discrimination and ensure equal opportunity. The University of Virginia is ranked among the top public universities and is known for its value and leadership development. This is the fourth university to strike such an agreement with the administration, with varying financial components in other deals.
