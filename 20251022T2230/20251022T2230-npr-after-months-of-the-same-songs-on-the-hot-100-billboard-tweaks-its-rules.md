## Article summary
Billboard has updated its rules for the Hot 100 chart to reduce the time successful songs remain on the list. The new rules, effective this week, remove songs that drop below certain thresholds after specific durations. Teddy Swims' 'Lose Control' spent over two years on the chart and was one of the 10 tracks removed. The changes aim to address issues with streaming algorithms that keep songs on the chart for extended periods. Under the old system, songs like 'Blinding Lights' by The Weeknd and 'Heat Waves' by Glass Animals had exceptionally long runs. The new rules set stricter time limits for songs to remain on the chart, with exceptions for certain cases, such as holiday songs and songs that are climbing in rank. Notable songs that have been removed include tracks by Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, and Kendrick Lamar.
