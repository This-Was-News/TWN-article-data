## Article summary
The Federal Reserve has reduced its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point for the third time since September, bringing the key rate to approximately 3.6%. This move aims to manage inflation and encourage employment, though inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target while the job market has cooled. For savers, falling interest rates are diminishing yields on certificates of deposit and high-yield savings accounts, though top rates still offer a better return than traditional accounts. Prospective homebuyers may see mortgage rates continue to hover around recent lows, with potential for rates below 6.00% in the coming year, which could encourage refinancing and new home purchases. Credit card interest rates have slightly decreased but remain historically high, though any reduction offers potential savings for debtors and may help stabilize delinquency trends. Auto loan rates are not expected to decline soon, despite the Fed's cut, and borrowers are increasingly falling behind on payments due to high vehicle costs and loan rates. For job seekers, the rate cut is positive news as cheaper borrowing for businesses could incentivize investment in additional employees. While the impact on the job market may take time, the Fed's action signals a commitment to supporting labor market growth. The current economic environment continues to present affordability challenges for consumers.
