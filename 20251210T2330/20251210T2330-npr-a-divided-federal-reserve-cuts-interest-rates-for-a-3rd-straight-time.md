## Article summary
The Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut on Wednesday, marking the third consecutive reduction aimed at bolstering a weakening job market. However, persistent inflation and delayed economic data are creating divisions within the rate-setting committee, leading to potential disagreements. A rate cut could make borrowing more affordable for consumers and businesses. This follows two previous rate reductions, which were also met with internal debate due to conflicting economic pressures. Inflation remains above the Fed's target, suggesting higher rates, while rising unemployment typically calls for lower rates. The recent government shutdown has further complicated matters by delaying crucial economic data from October and November. Policymakers are currently relying on September's figures, which showed inflation at 2.8% and unemployment at 4.4%. Investors largely expect a quarter-point cut, and the Fed will also release updated projections for future rates. White House economic adviser Stephen Miran, appointed by President Trump, has been the sole dissenter, advocating for larger rate cuts. President Trump has also sought to replace Fed Governor Lisa Cook, an effort currently blocked by the Supreme Court. Trump has been critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's approach to rate cuts, and Powell's term as chair is set to expire soon, with Trump expected to nominate a successor.
