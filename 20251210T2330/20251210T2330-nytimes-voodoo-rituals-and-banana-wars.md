## Article summary
The history of U.S. military involvement in Latin America is marked by frequent interventions, often with contradictory objectives and unintended consequences. From the Spanish-American War in 1898, which led to the U.S. acquisition of territories and prolonged involvement in Cuba, to the "Banana Wars" that saw Marines destabilizing and overthrowing governments in Central America and the Caribbean, the U.S. has consistently exerted its influence. In 1912, Marines occupied Nicaragua for 21 years to preserve U.S. interests during a revolt. Tensions with Mexico in 1914 escalated to a naval blockade and occupation of Veracruz following a dispute over arrested sailors and arms shipments. Haiti experienced a nearly 20-year Marine occupation starting in 1915 after political turmoil partly fueled by U.S. actions. The U.S. also pursued Pancho Villa in Mexico from 1915 to 1917 after turning against him, a futile hunt that turned Villa into a Mexican folk hero. In 1983, Operation Urgent Fury saw U.S. troops invade Grenada to protect American students and overthrow its government. The 1989 invasion of Panama, aimed at ousting Manuel Noriega, famously included a retraction of a claim about finding cocaine, which turned out to be tamales. Most recently, in 1994, U.S. troops intervened in Haiti to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had been democratically elected but overthrown, only for him to be ousted again years later with U.S. backing.
