## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered a return to the Times New Roman font for all diplomatic correspondence, reversing a Biden administration decision to switch to Calibri. Rubio deemed Calibri "woke," wasteful, confusing, and unprofessional, arguing it undermined the dignity of U.S. government documents. He stated that the shift to Calibri, a sans-serif font, was a result of misguided diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies implemented by his predecessor, Antony Blinken. The previous administration claimed the switch to Calibri would mitigate accessibility issues for individuals with disabilities, but Rubio asserted this goal was not achieved and cited a $145,000 cost to the department without providing evidence. Since taking office, Rubio has been dismantling DEI programs across the State Department, aligning with President Donald Trump's broader directives to federal agencies to focus on merit-based standards. This includes abolishing offices and initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion, both domestically and internationally. Rubio described the switch to Calibri as a cosmetic change that degraded the department's correspondence and clashed with the State Department's letterhead. The memo announcing the change mandates an update to all official document templates to remove Calibri, with exceptions for international treaties and presidential appointments, which will continue to use Courier New 12-point font.
