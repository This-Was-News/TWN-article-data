## Article summary
California is experiencing a surge in death cap mushroom poisonings, with 21 confirmed cases, including one fatality, and several individuals requiring intensive care or potential liver transplants. The highly poisonous death cap mushroom, which can be mistaken for edible varieties, is particularly prevalent this season due to unusually rainy weather. These mushrooms, originating from Eurasia, have spread globally and are responsible for a significant percentage of mushroom-related deaths worldwide. They typically grow near oak and other hardwood trees, often in urban and suburban areas, increasing the risk to humans and pets. The death cap contains a potent toxin, α-Amanitin, which causes severe and often irreversible damage to the liver and kidneys, with symptoms appearing delayed after ingestion. While treatments exist, including supportive care and in some cases liver transplants, a potential new antidote is under investigation. Health officials strongly advise against foraging for wild mushrooms and urge anyone experiencing symptoms to seek immediate medical attention. The death cap's ability to resemble edible mushrooms and its pleasant taste and smell make it a particularly dangerous threat.
