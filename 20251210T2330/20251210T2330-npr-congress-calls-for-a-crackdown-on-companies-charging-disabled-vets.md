## Article summary
A group of 43 members of Congress is urging federal agencies to take action against unaccredited companies that charge disabled veterans for assistance with their disability benefits claims. This call follows an NPR investigation revealing that these companies employ aggressive tactics, potentially violating federal law, to profit from veterans. Despite the VA offering free accredited services, some companies exploit a legal loophole created in 2006 when criminal penalties for such practices were removed. These firms, like Trajector Medical, have been found to use veterans' private information to access VA systems and bill them for benefit increases, even when not responsible for the increase. Lawmakers expressed serious concerns about data privacy and financial security, writing that these practices represent an "escalation in claim shark industry tactics." Two competing bills are currently in Congress: the GUARD VA Benefits Act, which would reinstate penalties, and the CHOICE for Veterans Act, which proposes a cap on fees. While Congress remains gridlocked, the VA has limited recourse beyond sending warning letters, and many of these companies continue to operate. Federal agencies have been asked to report on their actions to protect veterans and enforce the law, with former officials emphasizing the seriousness of these complaints.
