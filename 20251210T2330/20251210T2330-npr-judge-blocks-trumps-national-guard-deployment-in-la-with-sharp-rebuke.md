## Article summary
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer has blocked President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, ordering the troops returned to state control. The Trump administration had seized control of the California National Guard in June to confront protests against immigration enforcement, a move opposed by Governor Gavin Newsom. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal challenges faced by the administration regarding National Guard deployments to Democratic-led cities, aimed at combating crime and protecting federal immigration facilities. These deployments have largely become entangled in legal battles, reaching up to the Supreme Court. Initially, over 4,000 troops were sent to Los Angeles, though the number has since decreased significantly. The administration argued for extensions of federal control without review, a stance Judge Breyer sharply rebuked, calling it "shocking" and stating it could allow a president to create a "perpetual police force." Constitutional scholars have also raised concerns about the president potentially overstepping executive power and normalizing the presence of troops on city streets. Judge Breyer emphasized that the administration's argument for unchecked power over state troops would undermine federalism. The White House maintains the deployment was within the president's lawful authority and intends to appeal the ruling, which is stayed until Monday.
