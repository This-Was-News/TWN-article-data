## Article summary
President Donald Trump has launched a new 'gold card' program, which offers a pathway to U.S. citizenship for individuals and corporations that invest significant funds. Individuals can obtain legal status and eventual citizenship by paying $1 million, while corporations must pay $2 million per foreign-born employee. This program is intended to replace the existing EB-5 visa system, aiming to attract and retain top global talent while generating revenue for the U.S. government. Funds collected will be deposited into a Treasury Department account for national initiatives. The 'gold card' is essentially a green card, providing permanent legal residency with the possibility of citizenship, described by Trump as a more powerful and stronger path. Unlike the current EB-5 program, the new initiative reportedly omits specific job creation requirements for corporations and overall program caps. Trump stated the program addresses concerns from business leaders unable to recruit top graduates from U.S. universities due to their foreign status. This initiative contrasts with Trump's broader hard-line immigration policies and mass deportation efforts. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed a $15,000 vetting fee per applicant and emphasized a thorough background check process. The program aims to attract highly skilled individuals, with Trump specifically mentioning top graduates from China, India, and France as potential recipients. This 'gold card' concept is similar to investor visa programs offered by numerous other countries worldwide.
