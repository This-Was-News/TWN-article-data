## Article summary
Elon Musk, in a recent interview, stated that his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration was only "somewhat successful" and he would not repeat the experience. He expressed that he would have preferred to focus on his own companies, like Tesla and SpaceX, during that period, suggesting that his work with DOGE negatively impacted his businesses. Musk acknowledged the difficulty of rapidly reforming the federal government and the lack of popularity of the agency. Despite his reservations, he broadly defended DOGE's mission to identify and eliminate wasteful government spending, crediting it with potential annual savings of up to $200 billion through improved automated systems. However, this figure falls short of earlier, more ambitious promises of trillions in savings. The interview took place on the Katie Miller Podcast, hosted by a former DOGE spokeswoman married to a top Trump adviser. Since leaving DOGE, Musk's financial standing has improved significantly, with Tesla shareholders approving a pay package that could make him the world's first trillionaire. Miller did not delve into the controversial aspects of DOGE's operations during the conversation.
