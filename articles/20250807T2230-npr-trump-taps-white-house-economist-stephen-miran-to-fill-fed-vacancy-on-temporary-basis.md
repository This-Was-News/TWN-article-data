## Article summary
President Trump intends to nominate White House economist Stephen Moeran to temporarily fill a six-month vacancy on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, left by Adriana Kugler, who is departing early to return to teaching. Trump announced this via social media, stating he will continue searching for a nominee to fill a new 14-year term starting early next year, subject to Senate confirmation. Moeran currently chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers and previously worked in the Treasury Department during Trump's first term. Kugler's early departure provides Trump with his first opportunity to influence the seven-member governing board since returning to the White House. Trump has criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues for not aggressively cutting interest rates. Powell's term as chairman ends next May, but his board term extends to 2028, with his future plans uncertain.
