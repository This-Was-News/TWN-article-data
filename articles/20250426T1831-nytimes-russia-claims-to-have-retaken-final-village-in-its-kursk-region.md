## Article summary
Russia claims to have retaken the last village held by Ukraine in the Kursk region, according to General Valery V. Gerasimov, who reported the recapture of Gornal to President Vladimir V. Putin. However, Ukrainian officials contest this, stating their military operations in the area are ongoing and that they continue to hold their positions. The conflict intensified after Ukraine's incursion into Kursk last summer, which marked the first attack on Russian territory since World War II and led to significant clashes. While Russia asserts that Ukrainian forces have been defeated, Kyiv maintains that it could leverage the land taken for potential peace negotiations. The situation is complicated by the involvement of North Korean troops assisting Russian forces, a development that has been officially acknowledged by Russia. The U.S. has suspended military assistance to Ukraine, further complicating their defense in the region. Military analysts have debated the effectiveness of Ukraine's Kursk offensive, with some believing resources should have been focused on eastern defenses. Despite the challenges, Ukraine's leadership argues that the offensive has drawn Russian attention away from other fronts. The dynamics of the conflict continue to evolve, influencing international discussions about peace and territorial negotiations.
