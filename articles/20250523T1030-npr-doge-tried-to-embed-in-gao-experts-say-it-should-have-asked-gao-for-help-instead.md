## Article summary
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) attempted to embed its staff within the Government Accountability Office (GAO), but experts argue that it should have sought GAO's assistance instead. David Walker, a former head of GAO, emphasized that DOGE lacks the authority to review GAO's operations and that such an action would violate the separation of government branches. Both agencies aim to eliminate waste and fraud, but GAO has decades of experience and proven success, having saved billions through its recommendations. Walker likened GAO to a professional football team while describing DOGE as a smaller, less experienced group. Critics, including Linda Bilmes from Harvard, noted that DOGE missed opportunities to leverage existing government expertise, instead focusing on personnel cuts and overpromising savings. GAO is currently investigating whether the Trump administration improperly froze allocated funds, raising concerns about DOGE's potential conflict of interest. The future of GAO leadership is uncertain, as current Comptroller General Gene Dodaro's term ends in December, necessitating a new appointment that must have bipartisan support to ensure independence from the White House. Walker stresses the importance of this independence for effective oversight.
