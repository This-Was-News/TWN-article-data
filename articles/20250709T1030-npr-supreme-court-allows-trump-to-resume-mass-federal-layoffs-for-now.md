## Article summary
The Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to proceed with his plan to lay off hundreds of thousands of federal employees, lifting a lower court's block on the executive order. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the court was permitting the administration to act before the legality of the plan was determined. Trump's plan aims to reduce the federal workforce through "large-scale reductions in force" (RIFs), with agencies required to submit layoff plans. Critics argue that the plan bypasses congressional approval and could disrupt critical government services, while the administration contends the president has the authority to conduct such layoffs. The Supreme Court's decision does not address the legality of the plan, leaving the door open for further legal challenges.
