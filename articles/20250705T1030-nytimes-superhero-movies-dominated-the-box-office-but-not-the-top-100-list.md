## Article summary
Superhero movies have significantly influenced the film industry over the past 25 years, particularly after the release of Iron Man in 2008, which sparked a wave of blockbusters and cinematic universes. Despite their box office dominance, these films are notably absent from The New York Times' list of the 100 best films of the 21st century, as voted by industry professionals. While audiences may enjoy superhero films, there is a perception that they lack the prestige of top cinema, partly due to superhero fatigue from oversaturation. Two exceptions, The Dark Knight and Black Panther, made the list, praised for their serious themes and strong performances. The Dark Knight explores chaos versus control, while Black Panther addresses cultural divides within the Black community. Other acclaimed superhero films, such as Logan and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, are recognized for their unique storytelling and character depth, yet they are still often viewed as lowbrow entertainment. In contrast, a readers' list featured more superhero films, including Spider-Verse and Avengers: Endgame, which ranked at No. 100. Endgame symbolizes the culmination of a decade-long narrative, providing emotional closure for key characters. As of now, the popularity of superhero films appears to be waning, but their cultural impact during their peak remains significant.
