## Article summary
Congress has approved a significant tax change for tipped workers as part of President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, allowing individuals to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their taxable income annually. After this threshold, tips will be federally taxed, with higher earners above $150,000 facing taxation on their tipped income to prevent tax avoidance. This provision aims to benefit the majority of tipped workers in the U.S., although tax experts express concerns about potential misuse by high-income individuals. The law is set to phase out by the end of 2028 unless extended by Congress.

While the policy received bipartisan support, it faced criticism from Democrats who opposed cuts to Medicaid, predicting that over ten million Americans could lose health insurance as a result. Analysts suggest that the impact of this law on overall American wages may be minimal, as tipped work constitutes a small portion of the labor market. Middle and upper-middle-income tipped workers are expected to benefit the most, while lower-income individuals may not see significant gains. Tipped workers are advised to await further guidance from the IRS and adjust their tax withholdings accordingly. The broader implications of the bill indicate a regressive tax structure, with wealthy individuals receiving substantial tax cuts.
