## Article summary
The United States has announced the resumption of military aid and intelligence support to Ukraine following Ukraine's acceptance of a Trump administration proposal for a monthlong ceasefire. This decision comes after high-level talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, marking the first significant engagement between the U.S. and Ukraine since military aid was frozen earlier this year. Both governments described the discussions as crucial steps toward achieving lasting peace. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that the U.S. would present the ceasefire proposal to Russia, emphasizing that Ukraine is ready to cease hostilities and engage in dialogue.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the U.S. support and highlighted the need for diplomatic efforts, including stopping attacks and addressing the release of prisoners. While there was no immediate response from the Kremlin, Russian officials indicated a willingness to discuss the ceasefire. Analysts suggest that both Ukraine and Russia seek a more permanent resolution rather than a temporary halt to fighting. Ukrainian officials stress the importance of U.S. support, fearing that a perceived weakness could embolden Russia. The situation remains tense as both sides prepare for potential negotiations.
