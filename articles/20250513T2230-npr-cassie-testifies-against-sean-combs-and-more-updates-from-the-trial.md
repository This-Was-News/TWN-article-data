## Article summary
Cassie Ventura, the ex-girlfriend of Sean Combs, testified as the star witness in his federal trial, detailing a decade-long abusive relationship. She accused Combs of physical and emotional abuse, asserting he controlled nearly every aspect of her life, including her music career, while subjecting her to drug-fueled sexual marathons known as "freak-offs." Ventura described severe physical assaults, including being kicked and dragged, and alleged that Combs monitored her closely and used his employees to track her. Prosecutors allege that Combs engaged in racketeering and sex trafficking, using his empire to exploit women. In her opening statement, prosecutor Elizabeth Johnson emphasized that the case centers on coercive crimes rather than consensual relationships. Combs' defense attorney acknowledged his troubled behavior but argued that all relationships were consensual and dismissed the allegations as attempts to exploit him financially. Testimonies from other witnesses included accounts of violence against Ventura and incidents where Combs allegedly attempted to bribe security personnel. The trial is ongoing, with significant evidence and testimonies yet to be presented.
