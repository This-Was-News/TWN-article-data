## Article summary
President Trump's tariffs have been implemented, with the U.S. now having the highest tariff level since 1933, averaging 18.6%. These tariffs are expected to lead to higher prices for consumers, with companies like General Motors already absorbing some costs. Prices for clothing and textiles are projected to see significant increases, potentially rising by 39% for shoes. The average cost from tariffs for households is estimated to be $2,400 this year, contributing to rising inflation. Consumer prices rose by 2.7% in July, and further increases are expected as tariffs take effect. The job market has shown signs of slowing down, with fewer jobs added in July and a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. Economists predict slower hiring and potential job market weaknesses, which could impact consumer spending and economic growth. Despite concerns, most forecasters do not expect a recession, and stock markets have recently surged to record highs. Overall, the effects of tariffs will be felt by businesses and households alike.
