## Article summary
The recent four-day conflict between India and Pakistan was ignited by a terrorist attack in Kashmir on April 22, leading India to launch a cross-border military campaign. The clashes escalated unprecedentedly, with both nations engaging in airstrikes deeper into each other's territory than in decades. India's initial airstrikes aimed at terrorist-associated facilities resulted in a protracted dogfight, culminating in the loss of advanced Indian fighter jets. As tensions rose, India targeted sensitive Pakistani military sites, particularly air defense systems, raising concerns about further escalation.

Pakistan's response involved drone incursions and missile strikes on Indian military bases, leading to confirmed damage and casualties on both sides. The situation alarmed the United States, prompting diplomatic efforts for a cease-fire, particularly due to the risks posed by two nuclear powers engaging in such conflicts. Analysts noted that the new-generation technologies used in this conflict, like drones, could lead to more precision but also increased escalation risks. Ultimately, the four days of clashes may have shifted the nature of conflict in the region towards noncontact warfare, heightening fears of potential nuclear engagement.
