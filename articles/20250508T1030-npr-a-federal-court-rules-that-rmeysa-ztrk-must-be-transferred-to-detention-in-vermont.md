## Article summary
A federal appeals court in New York has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student, from Louisiana to Vermont for her immigration detention while her bail petition is reconsidered. Öztürk was arrested by federal immigration agents in Massachusetts and has been accused of supporting Hamas, although she has not been charged with any crime. Her attorneys argue that her detention violates her free speech and due process rights, and they emphasize that there is no evidence of her supporting terrorism. The court's ruling is seen as a significant victory for Öztürk, as fighting deportation is reportedly more difficult in Louisiana than in Vermont. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that having a visa is a privilege, not a right, and asserts its commitment to detaining individuals deemed to have no right to remain in the U.S. Legal experts highlight the challenges of appealing from Louisiana, which is under the jurisdiction of the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Öztürk's health has deteriorated in detention, exacerbating her asthma condition. A bail hearing has been scheduled for her in Vermont. The case raises broader concerns about the treatment of international students and their rights in the U.S.
