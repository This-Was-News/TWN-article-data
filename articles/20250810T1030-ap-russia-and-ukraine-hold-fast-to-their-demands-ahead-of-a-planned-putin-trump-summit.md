## Article summary
Russia and Ukraine remain firm on their demands ahead of a planned summit between Presidents Putin and Trump in Alaska. Putin seeks to negotiate a broad deal that would solidify Russia's territorial gains, prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, and keep Western troops out of Ukraine. He believes time is on his side as Ukrainian forces struggle against Russian advances. Zelenskyy, however, insists on Ukraine's right to seek NATO membership and rejects recognizing Russia's annexations. Russia has proposed a 30-day ceasefire contingent on Ukraine withdrawing from annexed regions or halting mobilization and accepting other conditions. Ukraine, meanwhile, demands an unconditional ceasefire and rejects any territorial concessions or restrictions on its armed forces. Trump's willingness to meet Putin without Zelenskyy has raised concerns in Ukraine and Europe. Putin has warned of tougher conditions for peace if Ukraine does not accept his demands. Observers suggest Putin may trade recent gains for territories still under Ukrainian control. Putin has also informed key allies about prospective agreements, indicating a possible ceasefire or peace deal. Analysts predict the peace effort may fail, with the conflict likely to continue in the foreseeable future.
