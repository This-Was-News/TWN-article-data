## Article summary
The Trump administration has proposed a budget that aims to cut approximately $163 billion in federal spending for the next fiscal year, affecting various education, health, housing, and labor programs. This budget reflects President Trump's goal to reduce government size and its involvement in citizens' lives, particularly impacting services for the poor. Key proposed reductions include $33 billion cuts to both the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Health and Human Services, alongside a $12 billion reduction for the Education Department, which would also cap Pell grants at a lower amount. The nutritional program for women, infants, and children would see significant benefit reductions, affecting millions of low-income recipients. Additionally, funding for the National Cancer Institute is set to be slashed by over $2.7 billion, raising concerns from cancer research advocates about the potential impact on medical advancements. Democrats have strongly criticized the budget as harmful to working people and economically damaging, vowing to oppose it in Congress. The White House has not provided full details on tax revenue estimates or Pentagon spending, leading to further discontent among lawmakers. Budget Director Russell T. Vought indicated that the administration may pursue additional spending rescissions and could use impoundment authority to bypass Congress on certain funds. Overall, the proposed budget represents a significant shift in federal spending priorities, emphasizing deep cuts across various domestic programs.
