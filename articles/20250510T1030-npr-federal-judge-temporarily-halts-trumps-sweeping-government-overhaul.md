## Article summary
A federal judge in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, is likely to temporarily block President Trump's extensive government overhaul, following a lawsuit from labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments. The plaintiffs argue that Trump's attempts to restructure the federal government without Congressional approval violate the Constitution. Judge Illston indicated her agreement with the plaintiffs, emphasizing that significant changes require cooperation from Congress. They are seeking a temporary restraining order to halt mass layoffs and program closures initiated by Trump's executive order. The Trump administration contends that the plaintiffs waited too long to file their motion and claims the court lacks jurisdiction over such personnel issues. Judge Illston questioned this argument, suggesting the radical nature of the overhaul warrants judicial review. The plaintiffs assert that agencies are executing the president's directives without proper transparency or independent analysis. The Trump administration defends its actions as lawful directives guiding agencies to align with presidential priorities. The case highlights ongoing legal challenges surrounding Trump's executive authority.
