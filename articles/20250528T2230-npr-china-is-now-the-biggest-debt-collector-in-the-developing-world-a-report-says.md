## Article summary
China has become the largest debt collector in the developing world, following a significant reduction in its international lending, according to a report by the Lowy Institute. This shift, which threatens poverty reduction efforts and increases instability, stems from China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has seen diminished funding since before the COVID-19 pandemic. While some analysts view China's lending as a potential debt trap, others argue it is driven by commercial interests and a learning process regarding debt restructuring. As of 2023, over a quarter of external debt in developing countries is owed to China, with these nations expected to pay at least $35 billion this year. Countries like Kenya and Zambia are struggling with debt servicing, which is diverting funds from essential services. The impact of U.S. tariffs and reduced global aid further exacerbates the financial pressure on these nations. Chinese loans, primarily in the form of debt rather than grants, are coming due after grace periods, tightening budgets and increasing instability risks. The situation has sparked political repercussions, exemplified by Kenya's recent elections influenced by anti-China sentiment. Sri Lanka's financial collapse and subsequent debt restructuring highlight the severe consequences of excessive borrowing. As the landscape evolves, the future of international debt dynamics remains uncertain, particularly for the most vulnerable economies.
