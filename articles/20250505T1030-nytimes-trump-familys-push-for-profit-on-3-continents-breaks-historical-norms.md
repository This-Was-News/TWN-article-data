## Article summary
Donald Jr. and Eric Trump are aggressively pursuing lucrative business ventures globally, leveraging their father's name and influence. Their initiatives include a luxury hotel in Dubai, real estate projects in Saudi Arabia, and cryptocurrency ventures in the U.S. This rapid expansion is unprecedented in American history, with potential revenues benefiting both the Trump sons and President Trump himself. Despite claims of no conflicts of interest, financial disclosures indicate that the president still profits from these ventures. Eric Trump emphasized that many projects were in progress before his father's re-election, while Donald Trump Jr. defended his business activities against accusations of nepotism. Recent activities included paid speaking tours in Europe and a new private club in Washington, catering to Trump supporters and influential figures. The club, Executive Branch, plans to open soon and has already attracted significant membership. Additionally, ventures like the $Trump memecoin are actively promoted by the Trump family, further intertwining their business interests with political connections. Overall, the Trump family's financial dealings raise questions about ethics and conflicts of interest during the president's term.
