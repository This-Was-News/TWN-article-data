## Article summary
A tsunami warning was issued for Northern California after a powerful earthquake off Russia's eastern coast, with initial waves reaching 4.5 feet. The warning covered a 100-mile stretch of the Northern California coastline, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon border, anticipating waves up to 5.5 feet high. Crescent City, known for its vulnerability to tsunamis due to its low elevation, recorded a 3.6-foot wave and has experienced 32 tsunamis since 1933, with five causing damage. The rest of the West Coast was under a tsunami advisory, with most areas expected to see waves of less than two feet. Authorities urged residents and beachgoers to stay inland and away from the water due to the potential danger from strong rip currents and powerful waves, even if they are relatively small.
