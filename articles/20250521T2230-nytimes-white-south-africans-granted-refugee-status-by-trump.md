## Article summary
During a White House meeting, President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with videos supporting his false claims of genocide against Afrikaners, a white ethnic minority in South Africa. Despite initial cordiality, Trump shifted the tone by dimming the lights and playing prepared footage that amplified fringe narratives, claiming that white South Africans are being targeted. Ramaphosa attempted to counter these assertions, highlighting that while there have been killings, they do not occur at a higher rate than those of other ethnic groups. The meeting also addressed the contentious issue of land ownership, as many Afrikaners feel threatened and persecuted due to government policies aimed at redressing historical inequalities. Recently, a group of Afrikaners arrived in the U.S. as refugees, claiming persecution in South Africa. Trump's administration has granted them refugee status, which critics argue is politically motivated. The U.S. plans to assist these refugees with resettlement, including housing and essential supplies. The situation reflects ongoing tensions surrounding race, land, and historical injustices in South Africa.
