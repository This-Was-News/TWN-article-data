## Article summary
The implementation of increased tariffs on imported steel and aluminum by President Trump is expected to raise the costs of food and beverage cans significantly. Currently, about 80% of the tin-plated steel used for food cans is imported, while a substantial portion of aluminum for beverage cans also comes from overseas. As a result, companies like Pacific Coast Producers anticipate a potential $40 million increase in costs, which could lead to price hikes for consumers. Despite the administration's claims that tariffs will protect domestic industries, manufacturers argue that previous tariffs have not resulted in increased U.S. production but rather a decline. The prices for steel cans and aluminum have surged considerably over the past five years, prompting some beverage companies to consider alternative packaging options. Craft brewers, who have recently shifted to aluminum cans, are also contemplating their choices in light of rising costs. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs has created chaos in the supply chain, with some companies facing challenges in sourcing materials at reasonable prices. Ultimately, the tariffs may inadvertently make it harder for domestic food manufacturers to compete with cheaper imports, raising concerns about their long-term viability.
