## Article summary
President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing U.S. drug prices by implementing a "most favored nation" pricing model, requiring drug companies to match lower prices paid in other developed countries. If drugmakers do not comply voluntarily, the administration may tie prices for government programs like Medicare to those in other countries. The order also tasks the U.S. Trade Representative and Department of Commerce with addressing policies that lower drug prices abroad, although the authority of the White House in this area remains unclear. Trump believes that this approach will not harm drug companies' profits, as it would pressure other countries to raise their prices. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) has criticized the order, arguing that it fails to address the root causes of high U.S. drug prices. This initiative follows a previous executive order from 2020 that was ultimately dropped and comes amid ongoing negotiations for Medicare drug prices under the Biden administration. The new order includes provisions for direct-to-consumer sales at lower prices, bypassing health insurance. Trump’s administration aims to provide price targets to drugmakers within 30 days. Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, supports the order, emphasizing the disparity in drug prices between the U.S. and Europe.
