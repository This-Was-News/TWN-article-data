## Article summary
A Peruvian farmer, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, lost a significant climate change lawsuit against RWE, a major German energy company, in a German court. Lliuya claimed that RWE's greenhouse gas emissions contributed to the risk of flooding from a glacial lake threatening his home in Peru. The court ruled that the likelihood of the lake overflowing was too low, at just over 1% in the next 30 years, to hold RWE liable. This decision concluded a decade-long legal battle in which Lliuya sought around $18,000 for flood protection costs, reflecting RWE's historical carbon emissions. Although RWE has transitioned towards renewable energy and aims for carbon neutrality by 2040, the case highlighted the growing trend of climate litigation against corporations. RWE contended that climate issues should be addressed by governments, not courts, fearing widespread liability for businesses. Despite the ruling, environmental group Germanwatch viewed the case as a partial victory, as it affirmed the principle that global climate change plaintiffs can pursue legal action in Germany. Experts suggest that the case may pave the way for future climate lawsuits against German companies. The ruling underscores the ongoing challenges in holding corporations accountable for climate-related damages.
