## Article summary
Steep U.S. tariffs on Indian products took effect, threatening $48.2 billion in exports. President Trump imposed a 50% combined tariff due to India's purchases of Russian oil. The Indian government warns of job losses and slower economic growth. Labor-intensive sectors like textiles, gems, and leather goods will be hardest hit. The U.S. exempted pharmaceuticals and electronics, providing some relief. Exporters fear significant losses, especially small and medium enterprises reliant on the U.S. market. Prime Minister Modi vowed not to yield to U.S. pressure, prioritizing farmers and small businesses. India plans local reforms to cushion the blow, including tax changes and financial incentives for exporters. The government is also exploring expanding exports to other regions like Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.
