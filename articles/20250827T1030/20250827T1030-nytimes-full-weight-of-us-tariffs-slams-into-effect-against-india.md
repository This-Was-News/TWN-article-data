## Article summary
President Trump has imposed a 50% tariff on nearly all goods imported from India, half of which is punishment for India's purchase of Russian oil. This tariff is expected to damage many Indian exporters and could disrupt the expanding economic relationship between the U.S. and India. The tariff also undermines the stability of billions of dollars of foreign investment in India's stock market. India is now alone with Brazil in facing a 50% tariff, higher than any other country. Trump initially threatened a 25% tariff in April, which was higher than India's competitors in Asia. The additional 25% tariff for buying Russian oil was announced on August 6, starting August 27. India had hoped to secure a better deal and had been increasing its purchases of American energy and defense equipment. The tariff will have a crushing impact on India's textiles, chemicals, machinery, gems, jewelry, and other industries. Prime Minister Modi has vowed to defend India's small-business owners, shopkeepers, and farmers, implying a potential shift in trade partnerships. Finance professionals predict the tariff will slow but not stop India's economic growth. Despite the tariff, India's economy remains resilient, having weathered previous global financial crises.
