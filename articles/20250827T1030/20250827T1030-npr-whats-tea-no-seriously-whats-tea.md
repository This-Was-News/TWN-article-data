## Article summary
The term 'tea' has evolved beyond its traditional meaning as a hot beverage. In modern slang, particularly in Black gay culture, 'tea' refers to gossip or what's happening. The phrase traces its origins to the 1970s, as noted by anthropologist William G. Hawkeswood, who linked it to gossip exchanged among friends. The traditional beverage 'tea' has English roots dating back to the 17th century, derived from the Chinese 'ch'a.' The slang term gained mainstream popularity through internet culture, notably via the 'Kermit the Frog sipping tea' meme in the 2010s. This meme, which originated on Tumblr, became a symbol for sly social commentary. The spread of 'tea' as slang was further accelerated by shows like 'RuPaul's Drag Race,' which popularized drag slang. The COVID-19 pandemic also played a role in mainstreaming the term by increasing online participation. Overall, 'tea' has transitioned from a cultural term to a widely recognized slang phrase.
