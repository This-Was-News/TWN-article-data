## Article summary
The Israeli military claimed that its strikes on a Gaza hospital targeted a Hamas surveillance camera, but the first strike killed a Reuters cameraman and others, including five journalists. The military provided no evidence to support its assertions. Witnesses and hospital officials contradicted Israel's account, stating that the second strike hit a group of people, including emergency responders, on a staircase. The Israeli military acknowledged gaps in its investigation and is conducting an ongoing inquiry. The strikes have drawn international condemnation, with calls for accountability and justice. The Israel-Hamas war has been particularly deadly for media workers, with 189 Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza. Meanwhile, protests in Israel demand the release of hostages and a ceasefire, while Palestinians in Gaza brace for an expanded Israeli offensive amid displacement, destruction, and famine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive in Gaza City to defeat Hamas and secure the release of hostages.
