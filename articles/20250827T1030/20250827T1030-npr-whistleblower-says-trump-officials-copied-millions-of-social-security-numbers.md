## Article summary
A whistleblower, Charles Borges, the chief data officer at the Social Security Administration (SSA), alleges that former senior Trump appointees from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) copied the Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays of over 300 million Americans to a private section of the SSA's cloud. This private cloud environment, accessible by other former DOGE employees, lacks adequate security measures, potentially putting sensitive data at risk. The SSA's career cybersecurity officials deemed the decision to copy the data as 'very high risk' and discussed the possibility of reissuing Social Security numbers if the cloud server was breached. The copied data had fewer security measures than the SSA's standard protocols. Andrea Meza, an attorney representing Borges, expressed serious concerns about the vulnerability of nearly every American's data. The SSA maintains that its data remains secure and that the environment is walled off from the internet. Borges' complaint is part of a broader pattern of DOGE and Trump officials being accused of disregarding privacy protections around sensitive personal information. In April, another whistleblower reported that DOGE officials took sensitive data from the National Labor Relations Board and tried to cover their tracks. The request for a copy of SSA data came shortly after a Supreme Court ruling granted DOGE team members temporary access to the SSA's most sensitive data. The NUMIDENT database, which includes extensive personal information, was copied to a private cloud with unfettered access for former DOGE officials. Despite cybersecurity officials' warnings, the data was transferred and authorized by DOGE-affiliated officials, including the SSA's chief information officer, Aram Moghaddass.
