## Article summary
Flag burning in the U.S. has a long history and is protected by the Supreme Court. President Trump has directed the Justice Department to prosecute flag burners, signing an executive order instructing the attorney general to pursue such cases. The Supreme Court has ruled multiple times that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment, with the landmark case Texas v. Johnson in 1989 affirming this right. Flag desecration dates back to the Civil War, with incidents involving soldiers and civilians. During the Vietnam War, flag burning resurged as a form of protest, leading to the Flag Protection Act of 1968. Despite Trump's order acknowledging free speech rights, legal experts argue that the administration is seeking to prosecute flag burners selectively. The executive order also threatens to deny or revoke visas for non-citizens who burn flags, which legal experts argue is unconstitutional. Overall, the order is seen as symbolic rather than a realistic attempt to address any real-world problem.
