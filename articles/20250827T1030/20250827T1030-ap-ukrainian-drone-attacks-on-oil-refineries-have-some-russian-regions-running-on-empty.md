## Article summary
Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries have caused significant fuel shortages in several regions, including the Far East and Crimea. These attacks, part of the ongoing 3 1/2-year-old war, have disrupted oil infrastructure, leading to long lines at gas stations and rationing in some areas. Wholesale gasoline prices in St. Petersburg have spiked to record highs, exacerbating the situation. The targeted refineries are crucial for supplying fuel to densely populated and agriculturally important regions. Ukraine's strategic strikes have slowed refinery activity, reducing gasoline production by 8.6% and diesel production by 10.3% in August. Additional factors like inflation and disrupted transportation networks have further strained fuel supplies. While Moscow remains largely unaffected due to its proximity to major refineries, other regions face significant challenges. Experts suggest the crisis may ease by late September as demand decreases and refinery maintenance concludes. However, the situation highlights vulnerabilities that could be exploited as drone warfare advances.
