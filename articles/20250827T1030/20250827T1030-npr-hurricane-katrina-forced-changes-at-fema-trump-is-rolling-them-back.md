## Article summary
Hurricane Katrina, which struck Louisiana 20 years ago, exposed significant failures in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s response, leading to over 1,300 deaths and widespread destruction. Post-Katrina reforms strengthened FEMA, requiring its leader to have emergency management experience and enabling faster response times. However, the Trump administration is rolling back these reforms, cutting disaster preparedness funding and slowing response efforts. Critics warn that these changes undermine FEMA's ability to handle large-scale disasters effectively, while the administration argues for reform to improve efficiency. Key post-Katrina changes, such as expert leadership and proactive disaster preparation, are now at risk under the current administration's policies.
