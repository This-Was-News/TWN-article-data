## Article summary
President Trump, who took office in 2025, initially had only two appointees on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. He elevated Jerome H. Powell to the chair position during his first term. Recently, a Biden appointee resigned, and Trump plans to remove another, potentially giving him a majority on the board. Trump has been vocal about his desire to reshape the Fed, criticizing Powell for keeping interest rates high. His first opportunity came with the resignation of Adriana D. Kugler, and he is working to remove Lisa D. Cook over mortgage fraud allegations. If successful, Trump could appoint another governor to serve until 2038. Trump's nominees must be confirmed by the Senate, which is back in session in September. Currently, two Trump appointees, Christopher J. Waller and Michelle W. Bowman, voted against the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Powell recently indicated the Fed is ready to resume rate cuts. Another reshaping opportunity arises in May when Powell's term as chair expires. The board also approves regional presidents responsible for financial regulation, whose terms expire in February, providing Trump another chance to overhaul the Fed system.
