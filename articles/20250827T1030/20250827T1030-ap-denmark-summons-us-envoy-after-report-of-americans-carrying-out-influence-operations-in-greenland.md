## Article summary
Denmark summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country for talks after reports that at least three individuals connected to President Donald Trump have been conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. The Danish national broadcaster, DR, reported that these individuals have been compiling lists of U.S.-friendly Greenlanders, gathering names of Trump opponents, and attempting to nurture contacts with politicians and businesspeople. The goal appears to be weakening relations between Denmark and Greenland. Denmark, a NATO ally, and Greenland have previously stated that the island is not for sale and condemned U.S. intelligence gathering there. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen expressed concern over foreign interference in Greenland's affairs and emphasized the importance of mutual trust between Denmark and Greenland. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) also noted that Greenland is a target for various influence campaigns aimed at creating divisions. The U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
