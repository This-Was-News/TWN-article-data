## Article summary
Some Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees who signed a public letter of dissent were placed on administrative leave. Over 180 current and former FEMA employees criticized recent cuts to staff and programs, warning of reduced disaster response capacity. Thirty-five signed their names, while 141 remained anonymous. At least two signatories received notices of indefinite paid leave, with unclear status for others. FEMA stated the action was not disciplinary. The dissent letter opposed policies like contract approval requirements and staff reassignments to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It also criticized the lack of a qualified FEMA administrator and cuts to mitigation programs. FEMA spokesperson Danel Llargues defended the Trump administration's reforms. Similar dissent has occurred at other agencies like the National Institutes of Health and Environmental Protection Agency, with some EPA staff also placed on leave.
