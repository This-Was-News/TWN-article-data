## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of mid-decade redistricting on the U.S. House of Representatives, highlighting how it may undermine the Framers' intent for the House to be closest to the people. President Trump's push for redistricting has triggered a political arms race, with Texas Republicans and California Democrats both moving to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 elections. This mid-decade redistricting could further polarize the House and reduce the number of competitive seats, potentially eroding the constitutional power of the people's House. The article also explores the practical implications for representatives like Rep. Kevin Kley, who could lose their seats due to redistricting. Analysts warn that increased partisan control over redistricting could move representation away from its intended function. The article concludes with calls for reform to ban mid-decade redistricting and the creation of nonpartisan commissions to address the issue.
