## Article summary
The article discusses the significant impact of artificial intelligence (A.I.) spending on the real economy. Investments in data centers, semiconductors, and power supply are driving economic growth, with companies projected to spend $375 billion globally on A.I. infrastructure in 2025, rising to $500 billion the following year. This spending is partly offsetting economic slowdowns in other sectors. Major tech companies and private equity firms are heavily investing in A.I. infrastructure, with Brookfield Asset Management estimating a $7 trillion investment over the next decade. The construction of data centers is outpacing traditional office buildings, and various industries, from construction to energy, are benefiting from the A.I. boom. However, there are risks, including potential overinvestment and the need for A.I. tools to become profitable. The long-term sustainability of this spending wave remains uncertain, with concerns about supply constraints and local opposition to data centers.
