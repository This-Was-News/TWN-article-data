## Article summary
The watch party for former Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on election night started quietly, with low music and muted televisions displaying results. Despite initial mingling, the atmosphere remained subdued as the night progressed. When Cuomo took the stage around 10:20 p.m., he acknowledged Assemblyman Mamdani's victory, leading to a disheartened response from some supporters who urged him not to concede. The event, held in a large space at the Carpenters Union Hall in Manhattan, featured minimal decorations, with only a few campaign signs present. Jessica Ramos, a state senator and Cuomo supporter, expressed optimism about high voter turnout despite the heat, suggesting that the election would shape the Democratic identity. However, as Cuomo congratulated Mamdani and exited the stage, many supporters left the venue in shock. The night ended without the celebration they had hoped for, marking a disappointing outcome for Cuomo and his backers.
