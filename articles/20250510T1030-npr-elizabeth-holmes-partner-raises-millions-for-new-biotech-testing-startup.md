## Article summary
Billy Evans, partner of former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, has raised millions for a new biotech startup called Haemanthus, which aims to utilize artificial intelligence for medical testing. Despite Holmes serving an 11-year prison sentence for fraud related to her previous company, she is advising Evans on the startup, although her exact role remains unclear. Haemanthus, which has a small team including former colleagues of Evans from Luminar Technologies, is currently in its early stages and focuses on light detection technology for medical diagnostics. The startup is exploring the use of Raman spectroscopy, a method that has potential applications in diagnosing conditions like ALS and certain cancers. Evans has primarily secured funding from friends and family, and Holmes is not expected to take a formal role in the company due to her SEC ban from public company leadership. Nevertheless, she has expressed intentions to return to the healthcare sector post-incarceration and has been writing patents while in prison. Haemanthus aims to make its technology commercially available and affordable, with applications for testing various biological materials. The company has plans to develop a consumer product, although specific details are still being finalized.
