## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of President Trump's tariffs on a Chinese factory owner, Maria Liao, whose toy manufacturing business is suffering due to decreased orders from American clients. The tariffs, which include a base of 20 percent on goods from China, have led to a nearly 30 percent drop in her orders this year. Liao, who runs her factory with her brother, expresses feelings of helplessness as she faces pressure from customers to reduce prices, which would undermine her profit margins. 

The tariffs are reshaping trade dynamics, challenging the long-standing reliance of Chinese businesses on American markets. Liao values the cultural exchange and insights gained from her American clients, particularly Erica Campbell, who has been a significant business partner. Both women share personal and professional challenges, highlighting their connection despite geographical differences.

As Liao navigates the uncertain landscape, she fears that continued tariff increases may prevent her from serving American customers altogether. The article emphasizes the shared struggles of small businesses in both countries amid escalating trade tensions.
