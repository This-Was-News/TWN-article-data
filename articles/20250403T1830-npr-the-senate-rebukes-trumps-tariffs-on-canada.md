## Article summary
The Senate has voted to rebuke President Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods through a bipartisan resolution, although the measure is largely symbolic as it is not expected to pass in the House. Sponsored by Senator Tim Kaine, the resolution was supported by four Republicans and aimed to end an emergency declaration used to justify the tariffs, which were claimed to combat fentanyl trafficking. Supporters argued that tariffs are detrimental to American families and that Canada is a vital ally, while opponents emphasized the need for such measures to address the fentanyl crisis. Senator Kaine highlighted the negative impact on businesses, citing potential price increases for consumers. Republican Senators who supported the resolution expressed that tariffs against Canada were unjustified, while most GOP members opposed the measure, fearing it would undermine efforts to combat drug trafficking. Trump criticized the bipartisan support for the resolution, labeling it a Democratic ploy and stating he would not sign it if it reached his desk. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and various unions endorsed the bill, arguing that tariffs are essentially taxes on Americans. The debate reflects broader tensions over trade policy and executive authority in tax matters.
