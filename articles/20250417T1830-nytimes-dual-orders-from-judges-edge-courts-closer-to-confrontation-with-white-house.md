## Article summary
The article discusses escalating tensions between the Trump administration and federal judges over the deportation of Central American immigrants. After nearly 240 immigrants were deported without due process, two federal judges expressed concerns that Trump officials acted in bad faith by not complying with court orders to rectify the situation. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III highlighted the potential breakdown of constitutional order due to the administration's actions. The conflict intensified as President Trump publicly criticized judges, including calling for the impeachment of Judge James E. Boasberg, while his advisers defended the administration's controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations. Judges from multiple courts have been vocal in their dissatisfaction, using strong language to describe the administration's disregard for legal directives. Judge Xinis initiated an investigation into the administration's compliance efforts regarding one individual, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, while Judge Boasberg threatened contempt proceedings if the government did not adhere to his orders. Recent Supreme Court rulings have reinforced the immigrants' rights to challenge their deportations, suggesting that the administration may need to take further action to ensure due process. Lawyers for the affected immigrants plan to leverage these rulings to push for their return from El Salvador. Overall, the situation signals a potential confrontation between the judicial and executive branches of government.
