## Article summary
China's exports surged in July, driven by companies rushing to ship goods to Southeast Asia, Africa, and the European Union ahead of increased U.S. tariffs. Overall exports rose by 7.2% year-over-year, with significant growth in regions often used for re-exporting to the U.S. Exports to the U.S. directly decreased by over a fifth due to tariff concerns. China's economy relies heavily on exports, partly due to a decline in domestic consumption. The U.S. trade deficit with China has narrowed due to tariffs, but China still exports three times as much to the U.S. as it imports. Chinese companies are diversifying exports to the European Union and developing countries. The U.S. has increased tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce dependence on China. A key question is whether the U.S. will further curb transshipment of goods through other countries. China has been moving production to countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Mexico to bypass U.S. tariffs. Some Southeast Asian and African countries are increasing tariffs to protect their own industries from Chinese competition.
