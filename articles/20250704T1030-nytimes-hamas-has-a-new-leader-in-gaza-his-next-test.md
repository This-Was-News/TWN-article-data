## Article summary
Hamas has appointed Izz al-Din al-Haddad as its new leader in Gaza following the death of Muhammad Sinwar. Al-Haddad, who played a key role in the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, is expected to influence the group's stance on cease-fire negotiations. He opposes Israeli efforts to remove Hamas from power and is likely to resist any demands for the release of hostages before a comprehensive peace deal. The U.S. is advocating for a 60-day pause in hostilities to facilitate talks, but Hamas is firm on seeking a lasting ceasefire. Al-Haddad has expressed intentions to either secure an honorable agreement or escalate the conflict into a liberation struggle. He has made public statements about Hamas's demands, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the lifting of restrictions on Gaza. Despite ongoing military pressure, al-Haddad remains a significant figure in Hamas, with a history of leadership in the group's military council. The war has resulted in over 50,000 deaths, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Al-Haddad's leadership marks a critical juncture for Hamas amid the ongoing conflict with Israel.
