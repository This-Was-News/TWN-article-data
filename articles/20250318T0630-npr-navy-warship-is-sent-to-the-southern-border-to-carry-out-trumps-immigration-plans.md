## Article summary
The USS Gravely, a U.S. Navy destroyer, has been deployed to the southern border as part of President Trump's immigration plans. This deployment aims to enhance border security and support U.S. Northern Command's mission to protect the nation's territorial integrity. The Gravely, which previously operated in the Middle East, is designed to intercept missiles and is capable of carrying over 300 crew members. It will operate in both domestic and international waters, although specific travel details have not been disclosed.

This move follows Trump's January executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border, which has seen the deployment of approximately 9,600 active-duty troops. The Gravely's mission will include law enforcement efforts against maritime-related crimes, illegal immigration, and other security threats. The ship will also carry members of a U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment. Overall, this deployment reflects the administration's ongoing efforts to strengthen border security amid broader immigration policy initiatives.
