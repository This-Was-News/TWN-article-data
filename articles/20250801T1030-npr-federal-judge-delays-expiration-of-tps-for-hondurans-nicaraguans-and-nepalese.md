## Article summary
A federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for individuals from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal, postponing the terminations until November. The ruling affects about 60,000 immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for over 20 years, with Judge Trina Thompson criticizing the administration's actions. TPS was initially granted to Hondurans and Nicaraguans after Hurricane Mitch in 1999 and to Nepali citizens after a devastating earthquake in 2015. The Trump administration has sought to end TPS designations for multiple countries, arguing that conditions have improved sufficiently for safe returns. However, the State Department advises against travel to Nicaragua due to arbitrary enforcement of laws and limited healthcare availability, contradicting the administration's claims of improved conditions.
