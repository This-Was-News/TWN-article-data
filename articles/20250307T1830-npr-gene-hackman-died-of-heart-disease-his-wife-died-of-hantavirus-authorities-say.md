## Article summary
Gene Hackman passed away from heart disease a week after his wife, Betsy Arakawa, died from hantavirus in their New Mexico home. Authorities confirmed both deaths were due to natural causes, with Hackman's health severely affected by advanced Alzheimer's disease. He may not have been aware of his wife's passing at the time of his death. The couple's bodies were discovered on February 26, with Hackman found in the entryway and Arakawa in a bathroom. 

Investigators ruled out foul play, and initial tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative. Arakawa's last known activities occurred on February 11, while Hackman's pacemaker indicated he likely died around February 18. The hantavirus is a rare disease typically reported in warmer months, and this was the first confirmed case in New Mexico for the year. 

The couple's dogs were also involved in the investigation, with one found dead and two surviving. Hackman, a celebrated actor known for films like "The French Connection" and "Superman," had retired to focus on painting and writing. He and Arakawa had a close relationship, having met in the mid-1980s.
