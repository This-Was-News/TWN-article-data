## Article summary
The Justice Department recently released a batch of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender, which failed to provide new revelations, disappointing many right-wing figures who had anticipated significant disclosures. Attorney General Pam Bondi had previously teased the release, claiming it would include extensive flight logs and names, but the actual documents contained mostly previously leaked information, including heavily redacted contact lists. Critics, including some attendees of a White House meeting where the files were discussed, expressed frustration over the lack of substantial content, with some labeling it a "letdown."

Additionally, a social media mishap occurred when the House Judiciary GOP account mistakenly linked to a Rick Astley music video instead of the Epstein files, which many viewed as inappropriate given the serious nature of the subject. Bondi responded to the backlash by asserting that the FBI had withheld additional documents and promised further releases. This incident has sparked criticism across the political spectrum, highlighting ongoing frustrations regarding transparency in the Epstein investigation and the handling of sensitive information.
