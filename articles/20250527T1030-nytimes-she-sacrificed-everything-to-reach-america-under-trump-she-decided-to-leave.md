## Article summary
Yessica Rojas, a Venezuelan mother, made the difficult decision to flee the United States with her two children after hearing alarming stories about other Venezuelan mothers being deported while their children remained in U.S. custody. The fear of losing her children, compounded by new immigration policies under President Trump, prompted her to leave Missouri, where she had settled after seeking asylum. Despite finding jobs and gradually adapting to life in Branson, the threat of separation drove her to seek a way out. 

In late April 2025, Rojas and her children embarked on a journey through Texas and Mexico, ultimately reaching the Darién Gap in Panama, where they faced the daunting prospect of returning to Venezuela amidst a humanitarian crisis. Along the way, they encountered other families who shared similar fears of separation and deportation. Rojas documented her journey, reflecting on the drastic changes ahead and the challenges of returning to a country plagued by shortages and high prices. 

Despite the hardships, she remained hopeful about reuniting with family and expressed gratitude for her children's safety, even as she faced the reality of starting over with little to show for her efforts. Ultimately, Rojas arrived back in Mérida, Venezuela, relieved to have her children with her despite the uncertainty of their future.
