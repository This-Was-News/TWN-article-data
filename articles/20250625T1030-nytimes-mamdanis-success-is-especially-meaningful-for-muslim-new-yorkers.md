## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani's strong performance in the Democratic mayoral primary marks a significant moment for Muslim New Yorkers, as he could become the first Muslim mayor of New York City if successful in the general election. With approximately one million Muslims in the city, representing 12 percent of the electorate in the 2021 mayoral race, Mamdani incorporated his faith into his campaign, engaging with the Muslim community while observing Ramadan. His victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo was fueled by a diverse coalition of voters, including young people and first-time voters, with Muslim support playing a crucial role. 

Mamdani's campaign highlighted a new generation of leadership, showcasing cooperation among Democrats of different backgrounds through cross-endorsements with Jewish and Black candidates. He confronted allegations of antisemitism due to his criticisms of Israel, sharing personal experiences of death threats linked to his faith. In his victory speech, he affirmed his commitment to human rights and the importance of diverse perspectives on global issues. Jewish candidate Brad Lander emphasized unity between Muslim and Jewish communities during the election night celebrations. Prominent Muslim leaders celebrated Mamdani's success as a victory for justice and called for his protection amid the threats he faced.
