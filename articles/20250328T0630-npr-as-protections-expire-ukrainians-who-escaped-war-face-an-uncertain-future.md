## Article summary
Ukrainians who fled their war-torn country through the U.S. immigration program Uniting for Ukraine are facing an uncertain future as their legal protections are set to expire. Approximately 240,000 Ukrainians entered the U.S. under this program, which provided temporary protection from deportation and work permits. However, with the recent termination of similar programs by the Trump administration, many fear they may soon lose their status and be forced to return to dangerous conditions in Ukraine. 

Individuals like Oleksii Chyrka and Viktoriia Panova express anxiety over their precarious situations, with some already unable to work legally. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has paused processing immigration benefits for those under parole programs, leaving many in limbo. Despite the challenges, communities in places like Minneapolis have rallied to support Ukrainians, helping them build new lives and integrate into American society. 

Many Ukrainians are now seeking alternative protections, such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows for legal work and safety from deportation. However, the uncertainty surrounding their status continues to loom as they await decisions from the government. The hope among these individuals is that their plight will be recognized and that the U.S. will continue to support them amid ongoing turmoil in their homeland.
