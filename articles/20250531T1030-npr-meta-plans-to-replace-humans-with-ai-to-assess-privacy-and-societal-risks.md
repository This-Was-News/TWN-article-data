## Article summary
Meta plans to automate up to 90% of its privacy and integrity reviews, traditionally conducted by human evaluators, to expedite the assessment of risks associated with updates to its platforms like Instagram and Facebook. This shift is aimed at allowing product developers to launch features more quickly, but raises concerns among current and former employees about the potential for increased real-world harm due to reduced scrutiny. Critics argue that many product teams lack expertise in privacy, which could lead to significant risks being overlooked. While Meta claims that automation will streamline decision-making and that human oversight will remain for complex issues, internal documents suggest that sensitive areas, including AI safety and youth risk, may also be automated. The company emphasizes its commitment to user privacy but faces skepticism about the effectiveness of its new processes. Additionally, the changes coincide with a broader push to enhance efficiency amid competition from other tech firms. Some employees express that the focus on speed could be self-defeating, as past scrutiny has often identified critical issues with new products. Overall, the automation of risk assessments reflects a significant shift in Meta's approach to product development and user safety.
