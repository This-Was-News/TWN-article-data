## Article summary
The U.S. State Department has announced a reduction in its diplomatic presence in Iraq due to heightened tensions in the Middle East and a potential deadlock in nuclear negotiations with Iran. This decision coincides with a warning from the United Kingdom about new threats to commercial shipping in the region. President Trump expressed concerns regarding the likelihood of reaching a deal with Iran that would curb its nuclear weapons development, following reports of an unacceptable negotiating position from Iran. 

The UK's maritime trade agency advised commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and Strait of Hormuz to exercise increased caution due to escalating tensions. Iranian Defense Minister General Aziz Nasirzadeh threatened that the U.S. would face significant losses from Iranian attacks on its bases if conflicts arise from failed nuclear talks. 

While the State Department did not disclose specifics about the number of personnel being withdrawn, reports indicate that nonessential U.S. staff will leave Baghdad, and family members of diplomats in Bahrain and Kuwait have been authorized to depart. The situation reflects growing concerns over regional stability and the implications of stalled diplomatic efforts.
