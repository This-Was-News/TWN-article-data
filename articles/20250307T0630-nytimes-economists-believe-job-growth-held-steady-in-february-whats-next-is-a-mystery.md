## Article summary
The article discusses expectations surrounding the U.S. jobs report, with economists predicting an addition of 160,000 jobs in February, up from 143,000 in January, while the unemployment rate is anticipated to remain steady at 4 percent. This report marks the first full monthly employment assessment under President Trump's administration. Analysts express concern about potential cooling in economic growth, linked to recent federal job cuts and tariff policies impacting businesses. Despite a slowdown in private-sector hiring since 2021, unemployment rates have remained low, and wage growth has outpaced inflation since mid-2023. However, rising uncertainty in the market, exacerbated by tariffs on major trading partners, has led to investor anxiety. The stock market has experienced significant declines, particularly among large technology firms, contributing to a challenging economic outlook. The upcoming jobs data is viewed as crucial for assessing economic strength amid these concerns. Overall, the mood among market traders and economists is increasingly cautious as they await further indicators of the economy's trajectory.
