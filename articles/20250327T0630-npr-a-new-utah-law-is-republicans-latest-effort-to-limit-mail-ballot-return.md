## Article summary
Utah Governor Spencer Cox has signed a new law that eliminates the grace period for mail ballots, requiring them to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. This change is part of a broader Republican effort to restrict mail voting and aligns with similar legislative actions in other states, including Kansas. Previously, voters had up to two weeks to submit their ballots if they were postmarked by the day before the election.

Proponents argue that these measures enhance election security and facilitate quicker results, which they believe will increase public confidence in the electoral process. However, voting rights advocates warn that such changes may hinder access to voting, particularly for those who rely on mail-in ballots. The law also transitions Utah away from being a universal mail-voting state, requiring voters to request ballots starting in 2029.

Critics, including Barbara Smith Warner from the National Vote At Home Institute, predict a decline in voter turnout as many voters may be unprepared for the new requirements. The law reflects a growing trend among Republican-led states to tighten mail voting regulations amidst ongoing debates about election integrity.
