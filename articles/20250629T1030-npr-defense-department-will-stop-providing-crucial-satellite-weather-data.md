## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Defense has announced it will cease providing crucial satellite weather data, impacting hurricane forecasters and sea ice monitoring as hurricane season approaches. For over 40 years, the Defense Department's satellites have supplied essential atmospheric and oceanic data, which is processed by the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center. The decision, attributed to cybersecurity concerns, leaves forecasters without vital information needed to track hurricanes and monitor their intensification in real-time. Experts emphasize that without this data, gaps in storm condition knowledge could lead to surprises during rapid intensification, posing risks to coastal populations. NOAA maintains that it can still provide accurate forecasts using other satellite data, although the loss of Defense Department data will create challenges for timely hurricane warnings. Additionally, the cessation of sea ice data sharing disrupts monitoring efforts critical for understanding climate change impacts and international shipping routes. The National Snow and Ice Data Center is scrambling to transition to alternative data sources, particularly from a Japanese satellite sensor, ahead of the June 30 deadline. This sudden change comes during a record-breaking low sea ice year, further complicating monitoring efforts. Overall, the Defense Department's decision raises significant concerns about future weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities.
