## Article summary
A U.S. District judge has ruled that Hampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel, must retain his position, deeming President Trump's attempt to remove him unlawful. Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Dellinger in a legal dispute regarding the president's authority over the independent agency. The ruling emphasizes that special counsels can only be dismissed for specific reasons, such as inefficiency or malfeasance, and not at the president's discretion. Jackson argued that allowing arbitrary removal would undermine the agency's role in protecting federal employees from illegal actions, including whistleblower retaliation.

Dellinger expressed gratitude for the court's confirmation of his job protections, which he sees as critical for safeguarding whistleblowers. The Justice Department plans to challenge this ruling in federal appeals court, with the case potentially heading back to the Supreme Court. Dellinger, who was appointed by President Biden, has been active in contesting the unlawful termination of probationary workers under the Trump administration. The judge highlighted that the independence of the special counsel is vital for the integrity of its mission, which includes investigating reprisals against whistleblowers and enforcing the Hatch Act.
