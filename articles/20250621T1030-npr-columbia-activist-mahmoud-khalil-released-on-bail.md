## Article summary
Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, has been released on bail after spending over three months in federal immigration detention. A federal judge in New Jersey ordered his release, stating that the government's attempt to detain him was "highly unusual" and likely unconstitutional. Khalil was arrested by ICE agents in March, becoming the first student targeted for deportation under the Trump administration for his pro-Palestinian activism. His detention raised concerns about the use of immigration charges as a means of punishment for free speech.

Upon his release, Khalil must surrender his Algerian passport and is restricted from traveling outside New York and a few other states. The government has not provided evidence supporting its claims that Khalil's activism threatened U.S. foreign policy and has not charged him with any crimes. Despite the Department of Homeland Security asserting that the immigration judge should decide on his detention, Judge Farbiarz emphasized the need for Khalil's release. Khalil's legal team is set to continue fighting his case in court, and he is eager to reunite with his wife and newborn son.
