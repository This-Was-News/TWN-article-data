## Article summary
Paramount Global has agreed to pay $16 million to President Trump's foundation to settle a lawsuit related to a _60 Minutes_ interview with Kamala Harris. The lawsuit, which legal experts deemed frivolous, alleged election interference due to CBS's editorial choices during the interview. As part of the settlement, Paramount will cover Trump's legal fees and commit to releasing transcripts of future candidate interviews, albeit with potential redactions. The settlement reflects a significant corporate decision that has drawn criticism from CBS News staff and legal commentators who argue it undermines journalistic integrity. 

Additionally, the settlement comes amid scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is reviewing Paramount's sale to Skydance Media and has been involved in the legal proceedings. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has supported Trump's claims by requesting CBS to provide raw footage of the interview, raising concerns about "news distortion." Critics view the settlement as "protection money," suggesting that it was motivated by the desire to avoid regulatory repercussions. Similar settlements have occurred with other media companies facing Trump-related lawsuits, highlighting a trend of corporations prioritizing financial peace over legal battles. The situation underscores the challenges faced by the press in maintaining independence in a politically charged environment.
