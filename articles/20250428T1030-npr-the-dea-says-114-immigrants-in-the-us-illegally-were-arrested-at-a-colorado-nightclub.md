## Article summary
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reported that a raid at an underground nightclub in Colorado Springs resulted in the arrest of 114 immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. This operation, conducted in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, also led to the seizure of drugs and weapons. The raid, which took place early on a Sunday morning, is noted as one of the largest single-day arrests of undocumented individuals since the Trump administration's mass deportation promises began. 

Video footage from the DEA showed agents breaking into the club while patrons were instructed to exit. Over 200 people were present at the time, and arrests began around 3:45 a.m. Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated that the nightclub had ties to gangs, specifically mentioning the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and MS-13. 

While two individuals were arrested on existing warrants, the legal status of the other detainees has not been verified. The DEA’s Special Agent in Charge highlighted the significant criminal activity occurring inside the club, which included drug trafficking and violence, noting the presence of active-duty service members among the patrons.
