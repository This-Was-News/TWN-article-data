## Article summary
The recent imposition of sweeping tariffs by President Trump has caused a significant downturn in stock markets, with the S&P 500 experiencing its worst day since the pandemic, falling nearly 5%. The tariffs, which include a base rate of 10% on most imports and higher reciprocal rates on specific countries, are expected to raise consumer prices and hinder economic growth, prompting fears of layoffs and reduced hiring. Major trading partners like China, Japan, and Germany have reacted with vows of retaliation, while economists predict a contraction in the U.S. economy due to increased costs and potential trade wars. The tariffs will particularly impact industries reliant on imports, such as technology and consumer goods, with companies like Apple and Volkswagen already adjusting prices. Additionally, the closure of the de minimis loophole will raise costs for U.S. shoppers, disproportionately affecting lower-income households. Experts warn that these tariffs could also disrupt the transition to renewable energy by increasing the costs of essential components. Overall, the administration's actions are seen as a dramatic shift in U.S. trade policy that could have long-lasting implications for both domestic and global economies.
