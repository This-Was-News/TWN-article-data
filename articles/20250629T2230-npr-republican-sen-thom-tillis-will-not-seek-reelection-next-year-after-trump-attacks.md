## Article summary
Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced he will not seek reelection next year, following criticism from President Trump over his vote against a GOP tax and spending bill. Tillis was one of the few Senate Republicans to oppose the legislation, citing concerns about its Medicaid provisions and potential costs to his state. In his statement, he expressed frustration with the lack of bipartisanship in Washington, criticizing politicians who prioritize political gain over the welfare of their constituents. He reflected on the divisive political atmosphere and chose to focus on family instead of enduring another term in office. The upcoming election for his seat is expected to be competitive, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee suggesting it could be a significant loss for Republicans. Former Rep. Wiley Nickel is currently the only Democrat running, while national Democrats hope popular former Governor Roy Cooper may enter the race. Meanwhile, GOP leaders remain optimistic about maintaining their hold on the seat, citing Trump’s popularity in the state.
