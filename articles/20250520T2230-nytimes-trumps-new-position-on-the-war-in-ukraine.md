## Article summary
President Trump has shifted his stance on the Ukraine war, indicating a willingness to step back from U.S. involvement in negotiations for a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine. Following a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump suggested that Ukraine and Russia need to resolve their issues independently, contradicting his earlier claims of being able to broker a deal. This change raises concerns about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as Trump has backed away from advocating for new sanctions against Russia. Critics argue that Trump's approach reflects a tendency to pressure Ukraine rather than the aggressor, Russia. While U.S. officials maintain that existing sanctions and military aid to Ukraine remain intact, Trump's recent comments signal a potential end to active American diplomatic efforts in the region. He expressed an eagerness to normalize relations with Russia, aiming for economic opportunities post-conflict. This has created a rift between the U.S. and its European allies, who are moving forward with their own sanctions against Russia. The situation is set to be a focal point at upcoming international summits, where the differing approaches to Ukraine may come to a head. Overall, Trump's latest position suggests a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy regarding the Ukraine conflict.
