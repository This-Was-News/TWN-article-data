## Article summary
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced his return, highlighting the government's efforts in rectifying the situation. Abrego Garcia is indicted for allegedly transporting migrants without legal status over a span of nine years, facing charges of conspiracy and unlawful transportation for financial gain. His attorney criticized the prosecution, arguing that it represents an abuse of power rather than justice, and emphasized the need for due process. 

Despite a 2019 court order against his deportation due to fears of persecution, Abrego Garcia was sent back to El Salvador and imprisoned. The case has sparked significant debate regarding the administration's deportation policies and their impact on due process rights. If convicted, Abrego Garcia could serve time in prison before being deported again. The situation reflects broader issues surrounding immigration enforcement and the legal rights of individuals facing deportation.
