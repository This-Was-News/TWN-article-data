## Article summary
Top congressional Democrats are demanding answers from Secretary of State Marco Rubio regarding a now-canceled plan to spend $400 million on armored electric vehicles from Tesla. In a letter, Representatives Gregory Meeks and Jared Moskowitz expressed concerns that the initiative represented a significant violation of federal procurement laws and could unlawfully benefit Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk. The plan, which reportedly originated during the Trump administration, raised questions about the legitimacy and oversight of the procurement process. 

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal also wrote to Rubio, seeking clarification on the Tesla deal. The State Department previously indicated that the $400 million figure was merely an estimate and that there were no current plans to proceed with the purchase. A document obtained by NPR revealed that the Biden administration intended to allocate just $483,000 for electric vehicle acquisitions in 2025, significantly less than the proposed $400 million. 

The Democrats' letter highlighted discrepancies in the documentation related to the Tesla purchase, suggesting possible alterations to mislead about the contract's origins. They are requesting information on who authorized the changes and proof that the contract has been definitively abandoned. The State Department and Musk have not commented on the matter.
