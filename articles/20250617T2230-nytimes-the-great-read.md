## Article summary
The article explores the claim made by Scott Flansburg, known as the Human Calculator, that basketball was invented in Herkimer, NY, rather than by Dr. James Naismith in Springfield, Mass. Flansburg argues that a teenager named Lambert Will conceived the game while tossing cabbages into a basket in 1890, a year before Naismith published the official rules. He has founded the Herkimer 9 Foundation to promote this narrative and create a basketball museum in his hometown. The origin story of basketball from Herkimer has been largely overlooked, but Flansburg and his collaborators have found historical references suggesting the town's significance in the sport's early development. Despite their efforts, they have not uncovered definitive documents to support their claims, leading to speculation about missing records. The article highlights the emotional connection of Will's descendants to this history and the ongoing struggle for recognition against the established narrative centered in Springfield. Flansburg's determination reflects a broader desire to preserve local heritage and pride in Herkimer's potential role in sports history.
