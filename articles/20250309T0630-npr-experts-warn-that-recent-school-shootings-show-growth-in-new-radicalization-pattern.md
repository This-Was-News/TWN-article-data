## Article summary
Experts are increasingly concerned about a new pattern of radicalization linked to recent school shootings, which they describe as "nonideological" terrorism. This trend is characterized by young individuals influenced by decentralized online networks that promote violence for its own sake. Two notable incidents, one in Madison, Wisconsin, and another in Nashville, Tennessee, exemplify this shift, as the perpetrators were reportedly inspired by past mass killers and engaged with communities that glorify such violence. 

Research indicates that these attacks reflect a merging of the True Crime Community (TCC) with darker online subcultures, leading to a concerning increase in school shooting plots connected to TCC members. The profiles of individuals involved in these violent acts are evolving, with younger and more diverse demographics becoming involved, including previously underrepresented groups. 

Additionally, the influence of online networks that exploit minors adds complexity to this issue, as these groups can encourage extreme behavior among vulnerable individuals. Experts highlight the lack of centralized data on school shooting threats, complicating efforts to identify and prevent radicalization. The growing challenge for law enforcement is to understand and address the intricate online dynamics that contribute to this new wave of violence.
