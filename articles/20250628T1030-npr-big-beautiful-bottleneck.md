## Article summary
President Trump's recent week has been marked by significant developments both domestically and internationally. A favorable Supreme Court ruling has made it harder for opponents to halt executive actions, which Trump hailed as a victory for the Constitution. His administration also celebrated U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. At the NATO summit, member states agreed to increase defense spending, aligning with Trump's long-standing advocacy for stronger commitments. However, Trump faces challenges with unfinished trade deals, as many negotiations remain unresolved ahead of a July 8 deadline. He has halted trade talks with Canada and announced a framework deal with China that is not finalized. Additionally, the fate of his "One Big Beautiful Bill," which combines his legislative agenda, hangs in the balance as it faces obstacles in the Senate. Trump is pushing for a bill signing celebration by Independence Day, emphasizing the importance of this legislation for his administration. With high stakes and pressure mounting, the coming days could significantly shape the trajectory of his presidency.
