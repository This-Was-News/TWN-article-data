## Article summary
Elon Musk publicly criticized a significant Republican bill aimed at enacting President Trump's domestic policy agenda, calling it a "disgusting abomination." He expressed his discontent on social media, urging House members who supported the bill to reconsider their actions and hinting at potential political repercussions in the 2026 midterm elections. Musk described the bill as massive and detrimental, claiming it would exacerbate the national budget deficit and harm American interests. His comments signal a growing rift between him and Trump, especially as Musk distances himself from his former governmental role. The legislation, officially titled the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, proposes tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy while reducing funding for health, education, and clean energy programs. While some Republican senators seek amendments to the bill, Musk's criticism highlights his concerns over the removal of electric vehicle subsidies that would impact his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. The White House, taken aback by Musk’s remarks, maintains support for the bill, with officials claiming it will shrink the national debt despite opposing analyses. Musk's previous political spending aimed at supporting Republicans contrasts with his current stance, which has garnered attention from Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer. Overall, Musk's criticisms reflect a significant shift in his political influence and alignment.
