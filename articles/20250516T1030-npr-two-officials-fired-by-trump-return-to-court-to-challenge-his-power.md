## Article summary
Cathy Harris and Gwynne Wilcox, officials fired by President Trump, are challenging his authority to dismiss them from their positions at independent agencies. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering whether Trump overstepped his Constitutional powers in their removal without cause. Lower court judges previously ruled in favor of Harris and Wilcox, referencing the 1935 Supreme Court decision _Humphrey's Executor_, which limited presidential removal powers. The Trump administration has appealed, arguing that these judges misinterpreted the precedent and that the president should have control over the executive branch. The case could impact the independence of other agencies, including the Federal Reserve, which Harris and Wilcox warn could also be vulnerable to similar firings. The Trump administration claims that the Federal Reserve has unique protections, but Harris's attorneys argue this reasoning lacks coherence. The dispute highlights differing interpretations of the Constitution regarding executive power and agency independence. Wilcox and Harris contend that overturning _Humphrey's Executor_ would lead to chaos, while the Trump administration asserts it is not seeking to overturn the precedent but to clarify its application. The outcome of the case could set a significant precedent for the authority of the president over independent agencies.
