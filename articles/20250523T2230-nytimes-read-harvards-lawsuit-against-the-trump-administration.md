## Article summary
Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government following the abrupt revocation of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, which has significant implications for over 7,000 international students holding F-1 and J-1 visas. The revocation, which occurred without due process, threatens the status of these students and disrupts numerous academic programs reliant on their presence. Harvard claims that the government's actions violate constitutional rights, specifically the First Amendment and procedural due process, and are retaliatory in nature, targeting Harvard for its perceived political stance.

The lawsuit details the extensive efforts Harvard has made over decades to integrate international students into its community, highlighting their contributions to academic excellence and diversity. The government, led by the Trump administration, has been accused of using the revocation as a means to coerce Harvard into compliance with its political agenda, particularly concerning issues of anti-American sentiment and antisemitism on campus.

Key points include:
- The immediate impact on Harvard's international student population and the potential loss of federal funding.
- Allegations that the government has acted unlawfully and without proper justification.
- A call for the restoration of Harvard's SEVP certification to prevent further harm to the university and its students.

The overarching message emphasizes the importance of academic freedom and the detrimental effects of government interference in educational institutions. The lawsuit seeks to challenge the government's actions and ensure due process is upheld.
