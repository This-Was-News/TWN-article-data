## Article summary
The push by DOGE to gather data is raising concerns among experts about the reliability of future U.S. statistics, particularly due to declining public trust in government and participation in surveys. The Trump administration's controversial handling of data has contributed to suspicions among the public, with many individuals expressing fears that their information could be misused. This mistrust is particularly evident among marginalized communities, which may lead to nonresponse bias in federal surveys, ultimately skewing the statistics. Experts warn that if public concern about government data access continues to grow, it could hinder the Census Bureau's ability to produce accurate and representative data. 

While the Census Bureau has legal protections to maintain confidentiality, public perception may not differentiate between various federal agencies, leading to broader distrust. Critics of DOGE's data efforts suggest that they could result in stricter laws that impede the statistical agencies' ability to use data effectively. Additionally, state officials may become hesitant to share records, complicating efforts for the upcoming 2030 census. The cumulative effect of these issues may create long-lasting challenges for federal statistical agencies in ensuring accurate representation and resource allocation. Ultimately, experts believe that rebuilding public trust will take significant time and effort.
