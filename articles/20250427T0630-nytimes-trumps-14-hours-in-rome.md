## Article summary
President Trump made a brief visit to Rome to attend Pope Francis' funeral and held a significant 15-minute meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This encounter occurred amidst ongoing tensions regarding the war between Ukraine and Russia, marking their first interaction since a contentious meeting in February. Trump described the discussion as productive, although details were sparse, while Zelensky emphasized the importance of security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression. Despite suggestions for further talks, Trump's quick departure curtailed extended discussions. The meeting's symbolism was heightened by the backdrop of the funeral, where world leaders convened, and it reflected the complexities of their relationship. Trump later criticized both previous U.S. administrations for Ukraine's situation and called for new sanctions against Russia. Zelensky, while pushing for a cease-fire, presented a counterproposal that included reparations from Russia but did not clarify territorial recovery. The meeting underscored the ongoing diplomatic challenges and the urgent need for a resolution in the conflict. As Trump returned home, he continued to assert that negotiations were close to a conclusion.
