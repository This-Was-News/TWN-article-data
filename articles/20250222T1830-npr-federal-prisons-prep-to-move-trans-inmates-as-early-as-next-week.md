## Article summary
The Bureau of Prisons plans to move transgender inmates to facilities that align with their assigned sex at birth, with transfers potentially starting as early as next week. This decision follows an executive order signed by President Trump, which has sparked significant concern among the transgender and legal communities. The impending transfers will affect transgender women in women's facilities and vice versa, regardless of whether they have undergone gender transition surgery. A lawsuit filed by a group of transgender women aims to block these moves, citing the heightened risk of assault in men's facilities.

Previously, the Bureau of Prisons conducted individual assessments for housing transgender inmates, prioritizing their safety and compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act. However, Trump's executive order has shifted this policy, leading to fears of increased violence and loss of access to hormone treatments for affected inmates. While the Bureau has not publicly announced its plans or responded to inquiries, internal preparations for the transfers are underway. Concerns about the potential risks to inmates have been acknowledged, but the Bureau intends to proceed with the transfers despite the anticipated legal challenges.
