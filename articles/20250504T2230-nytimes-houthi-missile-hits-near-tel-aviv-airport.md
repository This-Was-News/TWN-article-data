## Article summary
A ballistic missile launched by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia from Yemen struck near Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, leading to a temporary suspension of flights but no immediate fatalities. Israel's military attempted to intercept the missile, which marked a significant failure in their defense efforts. Four people were reported injured, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an urgent security cabinet meeting, threatening retaliation against both the Houthis and Iran. The missile attack was part of a recent escalation, with the Houthis increasing their assaults on Israel since the end of a cease-fire in Gaza. This incident was the fourth Houthi missile attack targeting Israel within 48 hours, with previous attempts being intercepted. The Houthis claimed responsibility and warned airlines to avoid the airport for safety. Opposition leaders in Israel criticized the government for its inability to prevent such attacks, emphasizing the threat posed by Iran. Following the strike, images showed significant damage near the airport, including missile fragments and a large crater. Israel's military operations in Gaza continue, aiming to weaken Hamas amidst ongoing conflict. The situation underscores heightened tensions in the region, particularly concerning Houthi aggression and Iranian influence.
