## Article summary
The U.S. military recently conducted airstrikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities, marking a significant escalation in the Middle East conflict. Dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," the strikes involved B-2 stealth bombers and Tomahawk missiles, targeting sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In response, Iran's Foreign Minister condemned the attacks as a violation of international law, warning of dangerous consequences and asserting Iran's right to self-defense. While Republicans in Congress largely supported the military action, many Democrats criticized it for bypassing Congressional approval and raising risks for U.S. troops. 

The extent of damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities remains unclear, with experts suggesting the program is not entirely destroyed. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed damage at the targeted sites but noted no significant radiation increases. Amidst rising tensions, the U.S. has heightened military readiness and is evacuating nonessential personnel from its embassy in Lebanon. President Trump hinted at the possibility of regime change in Iran, questioning the current regime's capability to improve the nation. The situation remains precarious, with potential for Iranian retaliation looming.
