## Article summary
An investigation into former National Security Advisor John Bolton gained momentum during the Biden administration, focusing on allegations of mishandling classified information. U.S. intelligence officials collected data from a foreign adversary's spy service, including emails with sensitive information that Bolton allegedly sent on an unclassified system. The investigation resurfaced publicly when federal agents searched Bolton's Maryland home and Washington office. The case raises questions about the extent to which former President Trump may be using the Justice Department and FBI to target perceived enemies. The emails in question reportedly contained information derived from classified documents Bolton accessed during his tenure. Bolton is reportedly consulting with high-profile criminal defense lawyer Abbe Lowell, who has represented other prominent figures under scrutiny by Trump. The investigation highlights ongoing concerns about the handling of national security secrets and the political implications of such probes.
