## Article summary
House Speaker Mike Johnson's sweeping legislation could significantly impact his rural Louisiana district, where over a third of residents rely on Medicaid. The bill risks closing health centers and leaving over 200,000 Louisianans without coverage. Constituents like James Collins and David Jackson worry about meeting new work requirements to maintain Medicaid benefits. Collins, currently homeless, depends on Medicaid for prescriptions and medical care, while Jackson fears losing access to healthcare for himself and his son, who receives speech therapy at a community health center. Johnson defends the legislation, framing it as a crackdown on waste, but critics argue it will cut nearly a trillion dollars from Medicaid, leaving 12 million people without healthcare coverage. Community health centers, which serve over half a million Louisianans, are at risk of closure due to reduced Medicaid reimbursements. Without additional funding, these centers may shut down or reduce services, further jeopardizing healthcare access in rural areas. Congress faces a deadline to reauthorize funding for these centers, but it's unclear if additional support will be provided. The legislation's impact could severely affect residents like Collins and Jackson, who are already struggling to access medical care.
