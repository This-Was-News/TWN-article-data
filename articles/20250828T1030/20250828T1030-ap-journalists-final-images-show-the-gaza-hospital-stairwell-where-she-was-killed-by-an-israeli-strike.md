## Article summary
Journalist Maram Dagga's final photos show the damaged stairwell outside Nasser Hospital in Gaza, where she was killed by an Israeli strike moments later. Dagga, a visual journalist freelancing for The Associated Press, was among 22 people, including five reporters, killed when Israeli forces struck the hospital twice in quick succession. The photos, retrieved from her camera, depict people walking up the damaged staircase and looking out the hospital windows. The Israeli military claimed they targeted what they believed was a Hamas surveillance camera, but witnesses and health officials disputed this. Dagga, 33, had been documenting the experiences of displaced Palestinians and doctors treating wounded children. Algerian ambassador Amar Bendjama read a heartbreaking letter from Dagga to her 13-year-old son, Ghath, expressing her love and wishes for his future. The letter, addressed to Ghath, who had left Gaza at the start of the war, emphasized her desire for him to remember her fondly and name his future daughter after her.
