## Article summary
A tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis left two children dead and 17 people wounded. Hundreds gathered for a vigil, where Archbishop Bernard Hebda praised the bravery of students who shielded their classmates. The shooter, 23-year-old Robin Westman, armed with multiple weapons, opened fire during Mass before taking his own life. The children who died were aged 8 and 10, while others, aged 6 to 15, were injured but expected to survive. The FBI is investigating the shooting as a potential act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. Westman's motives remain unclear, though authorities are examining his social media posts, which included violent imagery and anti-Trump messages. Police Chief Brian O'Hara noted that officers responded swiftly, providing first aid and rescuing children. The school community, described as accepting and caring, is mourning the loss and trauma. Governor Tim Walz and President Donald Trump ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff, and Pope Leo XIV sent condolences from the Vatican.
