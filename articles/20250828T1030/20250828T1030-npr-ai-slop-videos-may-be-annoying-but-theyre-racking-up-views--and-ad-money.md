## Article summary
The rise of 'AI slop' videos, characterized by rapid production, repetition, and generative AI technology, is cluttering social media and raising concerns about their impact. These videos, often bizarre or intentionally misleading, are gaining views and ad revenue, as seen with the YouTube channel FUNTASTIC YT, which features an animated kitten in nonsensical adventures. Critics argue that these videos are low-effort and spammy, designed to exploit algorithms for engagement and virality. Creator Mark Lawrence I Garlao, however, views the process as creative and fun, producing one or two clips daily. Despite criticism, these videos generate significant income, with Garlao earning $9,000 in one month. The proliferation of AI slop is overshadowing other creators and raising concerns about misinformation. Social media platforms are labeling AI-generated content but are not outright banning it. YouTube has updated its policies to include 'inauthentic' content, though the practical impact remains unclear. Meanwhile, platforms continue to invest in AI features, and creators like Garlao thrive on engagement, with his channel amassing nearly 600,000 subscribers and 500 million views.
