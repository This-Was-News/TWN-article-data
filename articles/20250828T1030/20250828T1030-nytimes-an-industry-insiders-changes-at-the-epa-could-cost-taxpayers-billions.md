## Article summary
Steven Cook, a former chemical industry lawyer, now holds a senior position at the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) and is pushing to repeal a rule that would require chemical companies to clean up pollution from PFAS, or 'forever chemicals.' This rule, which Cook previously fought against in court, could cost the industry billions in cleanup expenses. Internal E.P.A. documents reveal that after Cook met with industry groups, the agency's recommendation shifted from supporting the rule to advocating for its repeal. Critics argue this change could transfer cleanup costs from polluters to taxpayers. E.P.A. Administrator Lee Zeldin has not yet made a public decision on the rule's future. Cook's actions highlight a broader trend of former industry representatives influencing regulatory policies. The E.P.A. is also preparing to repeal numerous environmental regulations, focusing on reducing business and consumer costs. Despite some rollbacks, the Trump administration has maintained strict limits on two common types of PFAS. Cook's recusal from litigation does not prevent him from participating in policy-making, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.
