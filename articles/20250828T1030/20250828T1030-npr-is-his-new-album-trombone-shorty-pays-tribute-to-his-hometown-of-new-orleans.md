## Article summary
Trombone Shorty, whose real name is Troy Andrews, reflects on the impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans and his deep connection to the city's music scene. After evacuating during the storm, Andrews always felt drawn back to New Orleans, where he cherishes the local culture and cuisine. Growing up in the historic Tremé neighborhood, Andrews was immersed in brass bands and parades, thanks to his late mother, who was a cultural icon. His new album, 'Second Line Sunday,' is a tribute to his mother and the rich musical heritage of New Orleans. The album, a collaboration with his cousins and nephews in the New Breed Brass Band, captures the joyous and raucous sounds of New Orleans streets. Andrews explains that even in sad moments, the music carries an undercurrent of joy and celebration. Tracks like 'Under The Bridge' highlight the collective excitement and unity found in New Orleans' musical traditions. The album celebrates the resilience and spirit of the city, which Andrews feared might be lost after Katrina. Through his music, Andrews continues to honor his roots and the vibrant culture of New Orleans.
