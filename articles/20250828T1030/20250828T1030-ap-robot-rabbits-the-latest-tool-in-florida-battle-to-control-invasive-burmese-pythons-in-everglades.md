## Article summary
Robot rabbits are being deployed in the Florida Everglades to lure and help control invasive Burmese pythons, which are decimating native species. These robotic rabbits mimic real rabbits in appearance, movement, and scent to attract the pythons. The South Florida Water Management District, in collaboration with the University of Florida, has placed 120 of these solar-powered robots in monitored pens. The robots emit heat and natural movements, triggering a signal when a python is nearby, allowing contractors to remove the snake. Each robot costs about $4,000 and is financed by the water district. Pythons, not native to Florida, have established themselves in the Everglades, with estimates suggesting tens of thousands to 300,000 snakes. Since 2000, over 23,000 pythons have been removed. The Florida Python Challenge, an annual event, offers cash prizes for capturing pythons. While the success of the robot rabbit project is still under evaluation, officials are optimistic about its potential to help control the invasive snake population.
