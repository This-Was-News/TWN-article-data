## Article summary
The White House announced late Wednesday that Susan Monarez, the newly appointed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), had been fired. This followed a tense confrontation with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who attempted to remove her from her position. Dr. Monarez, an infectious disease researcher, had clashed with Kennedy over vaccine policy, leading to the resignation of four other high-profile CDC officials in protest. Monarez, confirmed by the Senate, serves at the pleasure of the president, and Kennedy likely lacked the authority to dismiss her. The White House stated that Monarez was not aligned with President Trump's agenda of 'Making America Healthy Again.' Monarez's lawyer rejected the firing as legally deficient, arguing that the president did not announce it. The situation, along with the resignations, has thrown the CDC into further turmoil after a tumultuous month that included layoffs and a shooting at the Atlanta headquarters.
