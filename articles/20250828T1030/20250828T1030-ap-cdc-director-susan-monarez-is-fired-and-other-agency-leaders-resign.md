## Article summary
The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Susan Monarez, was fired after less than a month in office, with several top agency leaders also resigning. Monarez was terminated for not aligning with President Donald Trump's agenda and refusing to resign, according to White House spokesman Kush Desa. Her lawyers claimed she was targeted for upholding science. The CDC announced her departure on social media, but her lawyers stated she had neither resigned nor been informed of her termination. They accused the administration of systematically dismantling public health institutions and politicizing science. Four top CDC officials, including Dr. Debra Houry, Dr. Daniel Jernigan, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, and Dr. Jennifer Layden, also resigned, citing budget cuts, reorganization, and misinformation. Daskalakis criticized the appointment of vaccine skeptics to influential positions. Public health experts expressed concern over the loss of experienced leaders, calling it a disaster for public health. Monarez, the shortest-serving CDC director, faced a tumultuous tenure, including a shooting near CDC headquarters. Her firing followed controversies over vaccine policies and political interference in the agency's operations.
