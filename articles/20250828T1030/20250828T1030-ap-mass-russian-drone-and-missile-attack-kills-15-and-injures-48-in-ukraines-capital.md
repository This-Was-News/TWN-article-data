## Article summary
A massive Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv, Ukraine, killed at least 15 people, including four children, and injured 48 others. The attack, one of the largest of the war, targeted various locations across the city, damaging nearly 100 buildings, including a shopping mall and the European Union delegation building. Russian forces launched 598 drones and 31 missiles, with Ukrainian forces shooting down 563 drones and 26 missiles. The attack came as U.S.-led peace efforts have stalled, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticizing Russia's lack of commitment to negotiations. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the attack targeted military-industrial complexes, while Ukrainian officials reported widespread damage and ongoing rescue efforts. The attack also sparked condemnation from European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who called it a display of terror and barbarism. Residents and emergency responders described the scene as devastating, with bodies being pulled from the rubble and survivors trapped under debris. The attack has further complicated diplomatic efforts to end the war, with Zelenskyy demanding harsher sanctions against Russia if peace talks do not progress.
