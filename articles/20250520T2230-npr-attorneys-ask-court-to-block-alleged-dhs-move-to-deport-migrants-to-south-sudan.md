## Article summary
Attorneys are seeking to prevent the Trump administration from deporting migrants to South Sudan, arguing that such actions violate a federal judge's order requiring due process for deportations to third countries. These migrants include individuals from Myanmar and Vietnam who received deportation notices. In a court filing in Massachusetts, the attorneys requested a temporary injunction to halt the removals and the immediate return of any migrants already sent to South Sudan. Reports indicate that at least one person from Myanmar has already been deported. The administration has been negotiating with countries willing to accept deported individuals, having previously sent over 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador, citing gang affiliations as justification. Concerns have been raised about the safety of deporting individuals to South Sudan, which has a history of civil conflict and ongoing political instability. The document highlights the broader implications of such deportations, particularly regarding human rights and international law. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet commented on the situation.
