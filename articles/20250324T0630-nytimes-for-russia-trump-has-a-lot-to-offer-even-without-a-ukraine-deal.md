## Article summary
The article discusses President Vladimir Putin's strategic aims in negotiations with President Trump regarding Ukraine. While Trump is focused on achieving a cease-fire to end the conflict, Putin views these talks as a means to secure broader economic and geopolitical advantages. The Kremlin is determined to extract various concessions before agreeing to a truce, even while Russian missile attacks continue in Ukraine. Interviews with Russian officials indicate that Moscow sees the negotiations as separate tracks, prioritizing improved relations with the U.S. over immediate outcomes in Ukraine. 

Putin is leveraging Trump's desire for a peace deal to gain benefits such as reduced NATO presence in Europe and access to U.S. aviation spare parts. Russian officials express that a thaw in relations could alleviate sanctions and enhance global operations for Russian companies. However, there are doubts about whether Trump will exert pressure for a favorable deal for Ukraine, especially if negotiations become protracted. Ultimately, the Kremlin aims for a long-term framework that allows coexistence with the U.S. without interference in each other’s interests.
