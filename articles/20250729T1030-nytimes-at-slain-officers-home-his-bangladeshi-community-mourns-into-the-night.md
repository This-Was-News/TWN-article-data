## Article summary
The Bangladeshi community in New York City mourns the loss of Officer Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old immigrant and three-and-a-half-year veteran of the NYPD, who was killed in a shooting at a Park Avenue skyscraper. Officer Islam, a father of two with a third child on the way, was the first to die in the massacre, which left four others dead, including the gunman. He was remembered as a devoted family man, a pillar in his largely Bangladeshi neighborhood, and a mentor to young men in the community. Officer Islam had started his career as a security guard at a school before joining the Police Department, inspired by his love for law enforcement and his desire to leave a legacy for his family. His community gathered to pay their respects, with many recalling his kindness, dedication, and the positive impact he had on those around him.
