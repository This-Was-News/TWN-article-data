## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV, born Robert Frances Prevost in Chicago in 1955, has been elected as the 267th leader of the Roman Catholic Church, making history as the first U.S.-born pope and the first from the Augustinian order. He greeted the public from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, emphasizing a message of peace that he hopes will resonate globally. During his address, he expressed gratitude to his fellow cardinals, his former diocese in Peru, and honored his predecessor, Pope Francis. Leo XIV shares similar priorities with Francis, particularly in environmental issues and support for migrants and the impoverished. He studied at the Minor Seminary of the Augustinian Fathers and earned a degree in mathematics from Villanova University before pursuing theology at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. His ministry in Peru spanned nearly two decades, where he was appointed Bishop of Chiclayo in 2014 and became a cardinal the following year. The new pope's diverse heritage includes French, Italian, and Spanish roots, reflecting a rich cultural background. His election marks a significant moment for the Catholic Church, with a focus on outreach and social justice.
