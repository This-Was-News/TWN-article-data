## Article summary
President Trump is set to decide on potential U.S. military action against Iran within two weeks, as stated by the White House amid rising tensions following missile strikes from Iran that hit Israeli targets, including Soroka Hospital in Be’er Sheva. The White House indicated that negotiations with Iran could influence this decision. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to retaliate against Iran for the attacks, which he described as targeting civilians, while Defense Minister Katz labeled the missile strike a "war crime." The ongoing conflict has resulted in significant casualties, with reports of over 200 deaths in Iran from Israeli strikes and injuries among Israeli civilians. 

The Israeli military continues to target Iranian military infrastructure, including missile launches and airstrikes on nuclear facilities. Trump has expressed that while the U.S. has the capability to strike, he has not committed to such actions yet. Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei warned of severe consequences for any U.S. intervention, asserting Iran's determination to resist aggression. Meanwhile, European nations are advocating for restraint and a return to diplomatic negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program.
