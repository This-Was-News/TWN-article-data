## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of President Trump's announcement to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported cars and parts, which has led America's allies to adopt a defensive stance on trade. Countries like Canada, Japan, Germany, Mexico, and South Korea are particularly affected, with leaders expressing concerns over the tariffs as direct attacks on their economies and long-standing trade agreements. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney characterized the tariffs as a significant threat, while Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba indicated that all options for retaliation are being considered.

The tariffs are expected to escalate tensions and could trigger a global trade war, potentially harming both American and foreign automakers and stifling economic growth. The European Union is preparing counter-tariffs aimed at U.S. goods, particularly from regions that supported Trump in the last election. German officials are particularly concerned, as their automotive industry heavily relies on exports to the U.S., and they emphasize the need for a robust EU response.

Meanwhile, South Korea's government is convening to discuss the implications of the tariffs on its significant automotive exports to the U.S. The article highlights a growing sense of betrayal among allies who have relied on America's commitment to free trade and security, as Trump's administration appears to prioritize American gains at the expense of its partners. Overall, the situation reflects a shift in international relations, with allies feeling pressured to reconsider their economic strategies in light of U.S. actions.
