## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's proposal to significantly alter the American tax code by eliminating income taxes for earnings under $200,000 and relying on tariffs for revenue. This suggestion caught congressional Republicans off guard, as many had not heard of it and are already working on their own tax legislation. While some of Trump's previous tax proposals, like not taxing tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits, are being considered, many Republicans express concerns about the complexity and potential costs of these ideas. The proposed tax breaks are expected to be narrower than Trump’s vision, and there’s a push to target them towards middle- and low-income Americans to avoid excessive costs. The cost of implementing these proposals could lead to significant increases in the deficit, prompting debates on spending cuts in other areas. To navigate the legislative process, Republicans plan to use reconciliation, which imposes restrictions, particularly regarding Social Security. Instead of changing how Social Security benefits are taxed directly, they may offer broader tax breaks for older Americans. Overall, the Republicans are struggling to balance Trump's demands with fiscal responsibility and simplicity in tax code reform.
