## Article summary
The Trump administration has informed a federal judge that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador, is alive and currently detained. Abrego Garcia is being held at El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, according to a filing by a senior State Department official. This update follows Judge Paula Xinis' order for daily reports on efforts to return him to the U.S., after the Supreme Court upheld her ruling requiring his return. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who lived in Maryland for nearly 15 years, was granted protection from deportation in 2019 due to safety concerns in El Salvador. His deportation occurred in March when he was mistakenly placed on a flight with gang members. A Justice Department lawyer acknowledged the deportation was an "administrative error." His attorney expressed frustration over the lack of timely updates and the government's obligation to ensure his safe return. The law firm representing him criticized the delays as a violation of the rule of law. The ongoing situation highlights the complexities of immigration enforcement and the legal obligations of the federal government.
