## Article summary
China has initiated significant military exercises around Taiwan, simulating attacks and maritime blockades as a response to Taiwan's President labeling China a hostile foreign force. The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command confirmed that these joint drills involve multiple military branches, aiming to encircle Taiwan from various directions. While Chinese military activities near Taiwan are common, this marks the first large-scale coordinated exercise since October 2024. 

The exercises are described as a "resolute punishment" for perceived provocations from Taiwan, particularly from President Lai Ching-te, who advocates for Taiwan's independence. In contrast, Lai has been enhancing Taiwan's military preparedness and defense budget to counter Chinese threats. He also articulated a series of measures to resist Beijing, emphasizing Taiwan's commitment to democracy and sovereignty. 

The recent drills coincide with a visit from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, highlighting the growing military tensions in the region. Taiwan's defense ministry is closely monitoring the situation, noting an increase in Chinese military activities that challenge regional stability.
