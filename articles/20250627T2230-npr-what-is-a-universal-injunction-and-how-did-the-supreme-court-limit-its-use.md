## Article summary
The Supreme Court has limited the use of universal injunctions, which allowed individual judges to block executive actions nationwide. This decision is viewed as a victory for the Trump administration, particularly regarding an executive order that denied automatic citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. Instead of addressing the constitutionality of the order, the Court focused on the authority of federal courts to issue such nationwide injunctions. Universal injunctions, described as court orders that apply to everyone, have surged in use over the past decade alongside the rise of executive orders from multiple administrations. Critics, including Justices Thomas and Gorsuch, have labeled these injunctions as historically dubious. The ruling effectively ends the practice of using universal injunctions as a default remedy against executive actions, shifting the litigation landscape towards class action lawsuits and state-level suits. Legal experts anticipate that plaintiffs will adapt by utilizing other procedural avenues to seek broad relief despite this limitation. Overall, the decision marks a significant change in how federal courts can respond to executive orders.
