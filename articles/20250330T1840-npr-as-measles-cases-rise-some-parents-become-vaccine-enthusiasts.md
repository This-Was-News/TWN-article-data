## Article summary
As measles outbreaks rise in the U.S., particularly in Texas and New Mexico, there is a noticeable increase in vaccine enthusiasm among parents. Pediatricians are reporting a surge in inquiries about the MMR vaccine, with many parents wanting to ensure their children are vaccinated early due to rising health concerns. The demand for vaccines is particularly significant in areas where vaccination rates have declined, such as Florida, where kindergarten vaccination rates fell below the 95% threshold needed to prevent outbreaks.

Parents are increasingly worried about potential exposure to measles, especially with spring break travel approaching. Some are requesting the MMR vaccine for infants as young as 6 months, particularly if they are traveling to outbreak regions. This shift in attitude is seen as refreshing amid a backdrop of growing vaccine hesitancy in the U.S., where one in five parents are now hesitant about vaccines.

Additionally, concerns about future vaccine accessibility have emerged, particularly with new leadership in the Department of Health and Human Services. While the current interest in vaccinations is encouraging, it remains uncertain whether this trend can counteract the long-term patterns of vaccine hesitancy. The situation highlights the ongoing public health challenges related to measles and vaccination rates.
