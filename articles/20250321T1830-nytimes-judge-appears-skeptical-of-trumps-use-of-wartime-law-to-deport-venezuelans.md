## Article summary
The Trump administration is intensifying its immigration enforcement efforts, targeting not only undocumented immigrants but also legal residents and academics who express dissenting views. Recent actions include aggressive vetting practices at U.S. ports of entry and the deportation of individuals based on their political speech, raising concerns about civil rights and free speech. President Trump has denied reports of Elon Musk being briefed on U.S. military plans regarding China, while also emphasizing the need for strict immigration laws to protect national security. The administration has shut down oversight agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, further limiting scrutiny over its immigration policies. Columbia University has agreed to significant changes in response to federal pressure, including hiring new security personnel and re-evaluating its Middle Eastern studies program. Critics argue these moves threaten academic freedom and may set a dangerous precedent for other institutions. The administration is also invoking the Alien Enemies Act to expedite deportations of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliations. This law, rarely used in U.S. history, allows for the detention and expulsion of immigrants without court hearings in times of declared war or invasion threats. Overall, the administration's actions reflect a broader crackdown on dissent and a shift towards more aggressive immigration enforcement.
