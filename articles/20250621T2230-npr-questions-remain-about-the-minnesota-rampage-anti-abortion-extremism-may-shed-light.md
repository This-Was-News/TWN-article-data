## Article summary
The recent shootings in Minnesota, which resulted in the deaths of State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, are being investigated as a political assassination, with the suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, potentially linked to anti-abortion extremism. While public discourse has focused on Boelter's political affiliations, scholars suggest examining his religious beliefs, particularly his ties to the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), which often frames abortion as a "demonic enterprise." Boelter's notebooks reportedly contain targets that include abortion rights supporters, indicating a broader pattern of anti-abortion violence historically associated with conservative Evangelical movements. His rhetoric at Christian gatherings reflected a worldview shaped by his deep opposition to abortion, calling for a unification of churches against perceived enemies. The NAR's culture emphasizes "war" against social issues, fostering a belief in a divine mandate to impose Biblical law. Dehumanizing narratives about abortion as child sacrifice have permeated mainstream discourse, escalating tensions within the far right, particularly after the overturning of _Roe v. Wade_. Scholars warn that these narratives can lead individuals to take violent actions, driven by a sense of urgency to combat perceived evil. The Christ for the Nations Institute, where Boelter studied, condemned the violence, asserting it contradicts their teachings. Overall, the Minnesota rampage raises critical questions about the intersection of religious extremism and political violence in contemporary society.
