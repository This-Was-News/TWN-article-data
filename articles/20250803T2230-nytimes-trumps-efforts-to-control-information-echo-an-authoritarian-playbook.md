## Article summary
President Trump fired a Labor Department official responsible for compiling U.S. employment statistics after he disliked the latest jobs report, which showed the economy was not performing as well as he claimed. Trump accused the official of providing "phony" numbers, citing his own opinion as proof, despite the lack of factual basis for his claims. This action underscores Trump's tendency to suppress unfavorable facts and promote his own version of reality. The incident has created a chilling effect on government officials dealing with data, who now fear losing their jobs if they do not conform to the president's narrative. Career scientists, intelligence analysts, and nonpartisan statisticians, who traditionally provide neutral information, are now facing unprecedented pressure to align with the president's alternative reality.
