## Article summary
The state of Michigan's tourism campaign, Pure Michigan, has created a room and body spray called FRESH to promote the state and its summer attractions. The scent is designed to evoke the essence of a Michigan summer, featuring lavender and the freshness of the Great Lakes. Fragrance developer Tanya Thompson explains that scent impacts mood, memory, and emotion. The sprays are sold online for $32, with plans to introduce fall and winter scents later in the year. Pure Michigan aims to replicate the feeling of being on a summer beach or in the wineries. The campaign includes a $15 million marketing program with local partners and scratch-and-sniff panels in travel magazines. The fragrances are intended to position Michigan as a destination for slow, mindful travel. Beachgoers had mixed reactions to the scent, with some finding it welcoming and others skeptical about its ability to attract tourists. The campaign suggests specific travel spots, such as Belle Isle, to complement the scents.
