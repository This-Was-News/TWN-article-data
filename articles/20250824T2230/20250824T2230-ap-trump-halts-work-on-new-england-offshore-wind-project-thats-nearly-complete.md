## Article summary
The Trump administration has halted construction on the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off the Rhode Island shore, citing national security concerns. The project, developed by Danish company Orsted, is about 80% complete with 45 of 65 turbines installed. Despite clearing years of federal and state reviews, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order. President Trump has been vocal against renewable energy, calling wind and solar power a scam and vowing not to approve such projects. Scientists emphasize the importance of renewable energy to combat climate change, which is linked to extreme weather events. Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, both Democrats, criticized the decision and plan to pursue avenues to reverse it. The project, expected to power over 350,000 homes, is crucial for Rhode Island and Connecticut to meet their climate goals. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal also condemned the decision, calling it a major setback. The U.S. currently has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project. Green Oceans, a non-profit opposing offshore wind, supported the halt, citing environmental concerns. This is the second major offshore wind project the White House has halted, following a similar decision on the Empire Wind project in New York.
