## Article summary
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is rapidly expanding its workforce to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation plans. The agency, which enforces immigration laws and manages detention facilities, has received a significant budget increase to accelerate deportations. ICE is currently training new agents at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, and aims to hire an additional 10,000 deportation officers by the end of the year. The agency has streamlined training processes, including reducing Spanish-language requirements, to expedite the onboarding of new recruits. ICE is also equipping agents with gas masks and helmets and deploying security teams to protect officers during arrests, which have become increasingly violent. Special Response Teams, trained to handle high-risk situations, assist in difficult operations and accompany dangerous detainees during deportation. ICE agents are trained in immigration law, the Fourth Amendment, and the different types of warrants they can use. The agency's actions have sparked controversy, with critics arguing that ICE is too aggressive in its enforcement tactics, while ICE claims its officers are often the targets of violence.
