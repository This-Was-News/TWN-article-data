## Article summary
President Donald Trump has renovated the White House Rose Garden, replacing the grass with a stone patio inspired by his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The $1.9 million project, funded by private donations, includes new drainage systems and white grates with a Stars and Stripes motif. Trump explained that the change was necessary to prevent high-heeled shoes from sinking into the soggy grass. The renovation is part of Trump's broader mission to overhaul the White House, which includes gilding the Oval Office and plans for a new $200 million ballroom. The Rose Garden, originally designed during the Kennedy administration with the help of noted gardener Rachel Lambert Mellon, had suffered from poor drainage and lack of sunlight. First Lady Melania Trump previously oversaw a restoration project to return the garden to its original vision. Despite criticism, the garden has thrived with new roses and plantings. The Rose Garden has historically hosted significant events, including press conferences and signing ceremonies. The recent changes, including patio tables and umbrellas, have drawn comparisons to Mar-a-Lago's Beach Club. Stewart McLaurn of the White House Historical Association noted that the White House evolves over time, with different presidents and first ladies contributing their own visions.
