## Article summary
President Donald Trump has threatened to expand military deployments to more Democrat-led cities, including Baltimore, in response to Maryland Governor Wes Moore's invitation to discuss public safety. Trump has already considered deploying troops to Chicago and New York, similar to the ongoing deployments in Washington, D.C. Moore criticized Trump's use of federal power and highlighted Baltimore's recent reductions in violent crime. Trump accused Moore of having a poor record on crime and offered to send in troops if needed. Protests against Trump's military presence have occurred in Washington, D.C., with residents observing National Guard troops. Trump has targeted cities with Black mayors and majority-minority populations, leading to accusations of racism. Reverend Al Sharpton condemned the deployments as racist and a civil rights issue. Governors and mayors from Illinois and Chicago have opposed potential military deployments, vowing to protect their states and residents. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson promised to resist any military occupation and defend the interests of working people.
