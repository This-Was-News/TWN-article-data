## Article summary
Democrats have criticized President Trump's characterization of blue-state cities as crime-ridden and lawless, which the White House has used to justify deploying National Guard troops and federal law enforcement agents. Trump mentioned Chicago as a potential next target, though no timeline has been provided for such deployments. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel suggested Trump's threat is more about political animosity and immigration policies than addressing crime. Emanuel argued that Trump's actions in Washington, D.C., did not effectively tackle crime but were aimed at sanctuary cities. Violent crime in major cities like Chicago and Washington has actually decreased in recent years. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker stated there is no emergency justifying federal intervention and accused Trump of manufacturing a crisis. Trump also considered sending troops to Baltimore, which Maryland Governor Wes Moore dismissed as relying on outdated scare tactics, noting significant drops in homicides.
