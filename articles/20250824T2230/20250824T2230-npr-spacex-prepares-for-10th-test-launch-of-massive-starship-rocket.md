## Article summary
SpaceX is preparing for the 10th test launch of its massive Starship rocket, the largest ever built, scheduled to take place from a facility near Boca Chica Beach, Texas. The launch window opens at 7:30 pm ET, with a live webcast starting 30 minutes before takeoff. The test aims to evaluate the rocket's booster through a series of burns and hover maneuvers over the Gulf of Mexico, while the upper stage will attempt a suborbital flight to deploy simulated satellites. Previous test flights have faced failures, including a loss of control in May and an explosion during a pre-flight engine test in June. Despite these setbacks, SpaceX founder Elon Musk remains optimistic, emphasizing the importance of Starship for both NASA and SpaceX's future missions. NASA plans to use Starship to land astronauts on the moon by 2027, while Musk envisions using it to colonize Mars and deploy Starlink satellites. SpaceX has a history of overcoming initial test flight failures, as seen with its first rocket, the Falcon 1. Meanwhile, SpaceX continues to support NASA's missions to the International Space Station, with a recent successful launch of a robotic capsule carrying supplies.
