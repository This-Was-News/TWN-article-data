## Article summary
In Washington, D.C., President Trump's crackdown on crime has led to an increase in federal charges for low-level offenses. Lawyers and prosecutors have raised concerns about the enforcement of laws, as minor incidents are being prosecuted at the federal level. Mark Bgelow, a part-time delivery driver, was arrested for possessing an open container of alcohol and charged with assaulting a federal officer, which carries a maximum sentence of eight years. Defense lawyers argue that these cases are a result of the federal occupation of D.C. Torez Rley was arrested for possessing handguns, but prosecutors debated whether to pursue the case due to concerns about an unlawful search. U.S. Attorney Jeanne Prro has directed prosecutors to charge the most serious crimes possible. Edward Dana, accused of threatening the president's life, has a history of mental illness and erratic behavior. Judge Moxla A. Upadhyaya expressed frustration with the prosecutor's arguments, emphasizing the need for a common-sense application of the law. The crackdown has strained court resources, with the judge noting that the time and resources of the court are stretched beyond belief.
