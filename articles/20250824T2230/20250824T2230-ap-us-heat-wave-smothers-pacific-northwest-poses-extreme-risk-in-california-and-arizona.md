## Article summary
A severe heat wave is affecting the Western U.S., with extreme risks in Washington, Oregon, Southern California, Nevada, and Arizona. About 1.2 million people are under extreme heat risk, with temperatures expected to remain dangerously high without overnight relief. Tucson, Arizona, and inland Southern California are among the most affected areas. Additionally, 18.6 million people nationwide are under major heat risk, impacting workers and those without regular cooling and hydration. Portland, Oregon, recorded a preliminary record high of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 Celsius) on August 22. During a long-distance relay race, a runner collapsed from heat exhaustion and was hospitalized. Emergency visits and 911 calls spiked in Portland due to the heat. The city's highest heat risk of 2025 is being faced, with memories of a deadly 2021 heat wave that caused over 100 deaths. The majority of victims in 2021 were elderly and lived alone.
