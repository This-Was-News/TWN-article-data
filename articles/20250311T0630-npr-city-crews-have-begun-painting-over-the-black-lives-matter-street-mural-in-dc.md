## Article summary
City crews in Washington, D.C. have started painting over the "Black Lives Matter" street mural, a significant symbol from the 2020 protests following George Floyd's death. Initially painted in June 2020, the mural spans two blocks on 16th Street, near the White House. The decision to repaint comes after a Republican bill was introduced, threatening federal funding unless the mural was removed and the area renamed Liberty Plaza. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who had previously announced the mural's permanence, expressed her discontent with congressional interference, stating that the mural had inspired many during a painful period. 

Despite the removal, residents, like Adrianne Lind, emphasized that the mural's impact cannot be erased, as it was witnessed globally. The reconstruction of the plaza is expected to take six to eight weeks, with plans to incorporate new murals as part of D.C.'s America 250 project, inviting students and artists to contribute. Bowser acknowledged the mural's role in helping the city through a dark time in history and noted that the plaza will evolve, although details on future designs remain unclear.
