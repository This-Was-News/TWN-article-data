## Article summary
A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that U.S. drug overdose deaths have risen for the first time in over a year, with approximately 82,138 deaths reported for the 12-month period ending in January 2025. This marks an increase of about 1,400 deaths compared to the previous year, following a significant decline in overdose deaths in 2024. Experts express concern that this uptick could signal a reversal in the positive trend, suggesting that the factors contributing to the previous decline may no longer be effective. Fentanyl remains the leading cause of overdose deaths, but researchers warn of a dangerous mix of chemicals in street drugs. While some regions, particularly Texas, Arizona, California, and Washington, are experiencing increases, many areas are still seeing improvements. Experts caution that fluctuations in overdose deaths are common and can be influenced by various factors, including changes in the illegal drug supply and access to treatment. The report raises alarms as federal support for addiction-related programs faces potential cuts under the current administration. Advocates stress the need for continued investments in public health to address the ongoing overdose crisis. The CDC emphasizes the importance of monitoring and researching drug impacts to inform effective interventions.
