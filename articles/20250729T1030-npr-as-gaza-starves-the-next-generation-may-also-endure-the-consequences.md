## Article summary
The hunger crisis in Gaza has reached alarming levels, with a third of the population going days without food and a quarter experiencing famine-like conditions. Nearly 100,000 women and children suffer from severe acute malnutrition, and chronic hunger can have long-lasting effects on health and gene function, potentially impacting future generations. The crisis escalated after Israel blocked aid deliveries and resumed bombardments, leading to a reduction in aid distribution points and increased violence around aid sites. Children are particularly vulnerable, with malnutrition stunting physical and brain development and increasing the risk of future health conditions. While recovery is possible with early intervention and consistent care, the long-term effects of malnutrition and trauma can be profound, affecting not only survivors but also their descendants.
