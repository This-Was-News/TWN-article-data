## Article summary
Israel has launched a series of air strikes on Gaza, resulting in over 410 deaths and hundreds of injuries, marking the most intense military action since a ceasefire began in January. The Israeli government stated that the strikes were a response to Hamas's refusal to release hostages taken during the October 7 attack. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that if Hamas did not comply, severe consequences would follow. In the aftermath of the strikes, families rushed to hospitals, overwhelmed by the chaos and loss, with many reporting multiple family members killed. Hamas accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of breaking the ceasefire agreement and endangering hostages. The renewed conflict raises concerns about the potential for a full resumption of war after nearly two months of relative calm. Negotiations for a new ceasefire had been ongoing, but Israel demanded more hostages be released before any discussions could proceed. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has worsened, with Israel blocking essential supplies to pressure Hamas. Many residents expressed shock at the sudden return of violence, fearing for their lives and the safety of their families.
