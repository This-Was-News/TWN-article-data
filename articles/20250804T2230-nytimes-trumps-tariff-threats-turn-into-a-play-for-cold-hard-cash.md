## Article summary
President Trump is using a strategy reminiscent of his "Art of the Deal" approach to pressure trading partners into making significant financial investments in the U.S. to avoid high tariffs. This tactic involves demanding multibillion-dollar investment pledges from countries like South Korea, Japan, and the European Union, which have agreed to substantial investments and purchases. However, the vague nature of these commitments and the lack of clear enforcement mechanisms raise questions about their validity and enforceability. Experts worry that this approach could lead to long-term negative consequences, such as trading partners imposing more onerous terms on the U.S. Despite these concerns, Trump continues to tout these investment pledges as successes, highlighting his negotiation prowess.
