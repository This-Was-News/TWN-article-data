## Article summary
President Trump has announced plans to expand his review of U.S. museums, starting with the Smithsonian Institution, which he calls 'the last remaining segment of 'WOKE.'' The White House has begun an audit of the Smithsonian, but the scope and methods of this review for other museums remain unclear. Trump's administration is exploring options to align museums with his vision, potentially using legal and financial pressures. The American Alliance of Museums (AAM) has expressed concerns, emphasizing the independence and integrity of museums. Trump's focus seems to target representations of Black American history, which critics argue is an attempt to erase Black voices. The Smithsonian, heavily funded by federal sources, is a unique case, and experts worry about government influence on local museums. Museum leaders also fear pressure from donors to conform to political narratives. Legal experts note that while museums have First Amendment rights, funding issues complicate free speech protections. The AAM and other organizations are pushing back against what they see as growing threats of censorship, highlighting the importance of freedom of thought and expression in museums.
