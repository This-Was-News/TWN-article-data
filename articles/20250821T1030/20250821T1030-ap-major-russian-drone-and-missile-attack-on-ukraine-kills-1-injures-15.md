## Article summary
Russia launched a significant aerial attack on Ukraine, firing 574 drones and 40 ballistic and cruise missiles overnight, targeting western regions where much of Ukraine's military aid is stored. The attack resulted in at least one death and 15 injuries. This was one of Russia's largest attacks this year, occurring amid renewed U.S.-led peace efforts following Russia's 2022 invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, accusing Russia of stalling peace talks and urging stronger international pressure. Ukraine has continued its own strikes on Russian infrastructure, impacting fuel prices. Zelenskyy announced plans for intensive meetings to discuss security guarantees from allies, with potential direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the future. The talks could also involve U.S. President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign minister stated that security arrangements without Moscow's involvement are not feasible.
