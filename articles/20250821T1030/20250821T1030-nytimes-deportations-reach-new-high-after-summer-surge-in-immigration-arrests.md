## Article summary
Deportations under President Trump have surged, reaching nearly 1,500 people per day by August, a pace not seen since the Obama administration. With increased funding from a domestic policy bill, ICE is poised to expand its operations further. At least 180,000 people have been deported under Trump, with the agency on track to deport over 400,000 in his first year, though still short of the administration's goal of one million deportations annually. ICE has increased the use of charter planes for deportations and has resumed using a limited number of military planes. The expanded operations have drawn nationwide protests and legal challenges, but officials have continued with aggressive tactics. Unlike the Obama administration, which focused on deporting recent border-crossers and criminals, Trump's ICE has broadened its focus to include non-criminal immigrants. Arrests of non-criminals have increased significantly, though the summer surge in arrests has since subsided. The Trump administration has also expanded the immigrant detention system, adding new centers and holding more people, which increases the likelihood of deportation. With new funding, ICE plans to hire more agents, add detention beds, and expand partnerships with state and local governments to support its enforcement goals.
