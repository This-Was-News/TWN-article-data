## Article summary
The Texas House approved redrawn congressional maps that favor Republicans ahead of the 2026 elections, following President Donald Trump's push for a mid-decade revision. The maps, which would give Republicans five more winnable seats, need Senate approval and the governor's signature. Democrats delayed the vote by fleeing the state but were monitored upon return. Democrats plan to challenge the map in court and accuse Republicans of prioritizing political gain over addressing recent floods. Texas Republicans openly admitted the maps were drawn to benefit their party. The move has sparked a national battle, with California Democrats preparing to redraw their map to create five new Democratic-leaning districts, requiring voter approval. The Supreme Court's allowance of partisan gerrymandering limits Democrats' options to block the Texas map. Democrats argue the new map violates the Voting Rights Act, while Republicans claim it creates more majority-minority seats. The debate highlights the broader national struggle over redistricting and its impact on the 2026 midterm elections.
