## Article summary
Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has stated she will not resign despite pressure from former President Donald Trump, who called for her resignation following allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden, denied the accusations and vowed to address any legitimate questions about her financial history. The allegations, made by Trump appointee Bill Pulte, claim Cook falsely claimed two primary residences to secure better mortgage terms. Trump's push for Cook's resignation is part of a broader effort to gain control over the Federal Reserve, an institution he has repeatedly criticized for not lowering interest rates. Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, have expressed support for Cook and condemned Trump's actions. If Cook is removed, Trump would have the opportunity to appoint a loyalist, potentially shifting the Fed's policies in his favor. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve over economic policies and the independence of the central bank.
