## Article summary
President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., to combat crime marks a significant departure from historical norms. Unlike past deployments for natural disasters or civil unrest, Trump's move is a blanket response to crime, despite a drop in D.C.'s crime rate. The National Guard, distinct from other military branches, typically assists local law enforcement but is not equipped for widespread law enforcement duties. Experts argue that using the military for domestic law enforcement challenges long-standing principles and could lead to misuse of power. The National Guard's role is to support police, not replace them, and they lack the extensive training that police officers receive. Concerns arise from past incidents, such as the Kent State shootings, where military intervention led to civilian casualties. Critics suggest increasing local police presence as a more effective solution. Trump's actions have raised alarms about the normalization of military involvement in routine law enforcement.
