## Article summary
The article highlights the challenges faced by stateless individuals in the U.S., particularly under President Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown. Karna Ambartsouman-Clough, born in the former Soviet Union, has lived her entire life without citizenship from any country. Despite being married to a U.S. citizen and having lawful permanent residency, she remains stateless. The Trump administration's policies, including revoking naturalized citizens' status and challenging birthright citizenship, have increased the vulnerability of stateless individuals. Ambartsouman-Clough co-founded United Stateless to advocate for this community, which faces risks of indefinite detention and deportation to countries they have no connection to. The article also features Tanya Furlong and Danah Aracena, who share similar struggles and fears of detention. The U.S. lacks a legal framework to recognize and protect stateless individuals, leaving them in a precarious position. United Stateless is pushing for the Stateless Protection Act to provide legal solutions, but the bill has not progressed. The stories of these individuals underscore the human rights issues and the trauma associated with living stateless in the U.S.
