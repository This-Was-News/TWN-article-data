## Article summary
The Texas House passed a proposed congressional redistricting map designed to favor Republicans, with a final vote of 88 to 52. The map, authored by State Rep. Todd Hunter (R-Corpus Christi), aims to improve Republican political performance and will now proceed to the Senate. Democrats argued that the map is racially discriminatory and dilutes the votes of minorities. Protests occurred outside the chamber, with activists and lawmakers rallying against gerrymandering. Hunter defended the map, citing a Supreme Court decision that limits federal court intervention in partisan gerrymandering. Democrats proposed 12 amendments, all of which were either tabled, withdrawn, or ruled not germane. The map's creation followed a Democratic walkout that stalled the process for over two weeks, drawing national attention. The new map targets five Democratic-held congressional districts for Republican pickup. The debate highlighted tensions over racial gerrymandering and the fairness of the redistricting process.
