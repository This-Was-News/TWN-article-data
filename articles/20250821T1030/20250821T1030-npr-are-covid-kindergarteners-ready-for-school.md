## Article summary
The article discusses the readiness of 'COVID kindergarteners,' children born in 2020 during the pandemic, as they start school. Parents like Molle Sussman and El Frankel express anxiety about their child's transition to kindergarten, fearing overwhelming experiences. Research indicates that early childhood experiences significantly impact development, with pandemic-related stress and isolation potentially affecting cognitive and social skills. Studies show that infants born during the pandemic had slightly lower motor and social skills at six months but quickly caught up. Speech delays have also increased among toddlers, likely due to reduced social interaction. Experts emphasize the plasticity of children's brains and the importance of early intervention. Despite challenges, children are making progress, but efforts are needed to accelerate learning and address academic gaps, especially in disadvantaged communities.
