## Article summary
President Trump has used federal power to promote a vision of America that challenges the legitimacy of the Black experience and devalues diversity. He has criticized institutions like the Smithsonian for focusing on slavery and ordered the restoration of Confederate statues. Trump's rhetoric and policies have been seen as demeaning to people of color, while elevating a white-dominated society. Critics argue he has undermined diversity efforts and demonized immigrants. His administration has also obscured references to Black heroes and promoted extremist views through federal agencies' social media. Trump's actions have sparked protests and criticism, particularly in Washington, D.C., where he has taken aggressive measures to address crime. Residents and historians have expressed frustration and disrespect over his policies and rhetoric. Despite backlash, Trump's supporters appreciate his direct approach to addressing national issues.
