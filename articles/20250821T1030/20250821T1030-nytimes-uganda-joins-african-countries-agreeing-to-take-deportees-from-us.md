## Article summary
Uganda has agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who may not be granted asylum and have concerns about returning to their home countries, according to a statement from its foreign ministry. The country prefers to take in deportees from African nations and calls the deal a temporary arrangement without specifying the number of people. Uganda joins other African countries like Rwanda, South Sudan, and Eswatini in accepting migrants from the U.S. as the Trump administration seeks to expel tens of thousands of migrants. Rwanda recently agreed to take 250 deportees, and the U.S. Supreme Court approved the deportation of eight men to South Sudan. Eswatini has also accepted deportees but plans to repatriate them to their home countries. The foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for further details.
