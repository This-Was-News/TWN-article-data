## Article summary
Israel plans to mobilize 60,000 reservists and extend the service of others for an expanded offensive in Gaza City and other heavily populated areas, intensifying pressure on Hamas as ceasefire talks show signs of progress. This escalation is likely to bring more death and destruction to Gaza, which is already 75% destroyed and under Israeli control, and could force more people to flee, further disrupting humanitarian aid and risking famine. Israel's plans have sparked internal controversy, with families of remaining hostages fearing further military escalation and former senior security officials questioning the military gains. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis joined mass protests over the weekend, and the decision to summon reservists again could escalate tensions. An Israeli military official stated that troops would gradually move into Gaza City, including areas where Hamas still has military and governing capabilities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that operations will eventually expand to include refugee camps in central Gaza and the displacement camp of Muwasis, areas where Hamas may be holding hostages. Netanyahu has stated that civilians will be allowed to flee to designated safe zones with food, water, and medical care, but the specifics of these zones remain unclear. Israel has previously designated Muwasis as a humanitarian zone, but conditions there are dire, with little food, running water, toilets, or trash collection. Netanyahu has also proposed relocating much of Gaza's population to other countries through voluntary emigration, a plan seen by Palestinians and the international community as forced expulsion. The planned offensive could be delayed or canceled if there is a breakthrough in ceasefire talks, with Hamas accepting a new proposal from Arab mediators. Netanyahu has stated he will end the war if Hamas gives up power, lays down its arms, and releases the remaining 50 hostages. Hamas, in line with international demands, has offered to release the hostages in return for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The hostages are Hamas' only remaining bargaining chip, and it is unlikely to give them up if it believes Israel will resume the war and attempt to eradicate the group. Israel ended a previous ceasefire in March, imposing a blockade that pushed Gaza toward famine and launching daily airstrikes across the territory. Hamas has only released one hostage during this time, as a gesture to the United States. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of around 61,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, with women and children making up around half of the fatalities.
