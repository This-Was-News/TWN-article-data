## Article summary
President Trump's budget proposal for the next fiscal year includes a drastic cut of $163 billion in federal spending, targeting various domestic programs, including education, health, and housing. The proposal aims to reduce domestic spending to its lowest level in modern history, eliminating funds for programs that aid the poor, while increasing military spending and allocating significant resources to the Department of Homeland Security. Cuts include a 55.8% reduction in the National Science Foundation's budget, significant decreases in housing assistance, and the elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts. Critics, including some Republican lawmakers, have expressed concern that these cuts will harm low-income Americans and undermine military readiness. Additionally, the budget focuses on reshaping the government's role, promoting state control over housing programs, and eliminating climate-related funding. The proposal has sparked bipartisan backlash, with many lawmakers emphasizing the need for Congress to assert its authority over federal spending. Trump's budget also reflects a shift in priorities towards defense and space initiatives, potentially benefiting companies like SpaceX. Overall, the budget sets the stage for a contentious legislative battle over funding and priorities in Washington.
