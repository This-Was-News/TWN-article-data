## Article summary
Top economic officials from the U.S. and China are meeting in Geneva for crucial negotiations, the first since the trade war initiated by President Trump, which resulted in tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports and 125% on U.S. goods. While hopes for a breakthrough are low, the discussions aim to clarify each side's demands and potential paths forward. The ongoing trade conflict has adversely affected both economies, leading to significant drops in Chinese exports to the U.S. and rising prices for American consumers. Trump has signaled a willingness to lower tariffs, suggesting an 80% rate, though this remains unofficial and contingent on China's actions. Analysts express that a reduction to around 20% tariffs would represent substantial progress toward constructive negotiations. The World Trade Organization warns that ongoing trade divisions could severely impact global GDP, particularly harming poorer nations. Economists note that the urgency to de-escalate tariffs is rising as supply chain issues and inflation become more pronounced. The meeting's outcomes are closely monitored by businesses and investors, who are anxious about the implications for trade and economic stability. Both nations have vested interests in reducing trade tensions, but achieving a lasting resolution remains uncertain.
