## Article summary
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to meet President Trump at the White House to discuss key issues, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as trade tariffs. This marks Merz's first visit to Washington since his appointment as chancellor in May. Germany aims to alleviate trade tensions with the U.S., particularly as a deadline approaches for potential 50% tariffs on EU imports. Political scientist Cathryn Clüver Ashbrook notes the challenge for Merz to foster a collaborative relationship with the Trump administration while countering perceptions of Germany's contributions to global affairs.

Merz, a 69-year-old conservative, has been actively working on diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire in Ukraine and has increased military spending to address past criticisms from Trump regarding NATO defense contributions. The meeting follows previous visits by other world leaders who faced critical remarks from Trump. As Merz navigates this high-stakes diplomatic environment, he must balance his emotional responses with the need for constructive dialogue. The outcome of this meeting could significantly impact U.S.-German relations moving forward.
