## Article summary
The White House is exploring ways to assist farmers affected by recent steep tariffs imposed by China on U.S. exports, which have raised concerns in the agricultural community. Farmers like John Pihl express that these tariffs increase costs across the board and jeopardize their market relationships, particularly with Mexico, a major importer of U.S. corn. The Trump administration previously allocated $28 billion to support farmers during a similar trade conflict, and Secretary Brooke Rollins indicates that a mitigation plan is under consideration. However, the current tariffs are significantly higher than those from six years ago, leading to uncertainty about their duration.

Farmers are wary of the long-term impacts of these tariffs, as evidenced by China's pivot to Brazilian soybeans, which has diminished U.S. market share. Farmers prefer stable markets over government aid, viewing subsidies as a temporary fix rather than a sustainable solution. The timing of the tariff situation coincides with planting decisions for major crops, complicating the agricultural landscape further. While some farmers remain hopeful for negotiations to resolve the trade issues, they acknowledge the need for markets that yield profits rather than reliance on government support.
