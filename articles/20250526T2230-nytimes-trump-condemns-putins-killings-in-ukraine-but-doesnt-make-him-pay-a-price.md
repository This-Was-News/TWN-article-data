## Article summary
Former President Donald Trump expressed strong criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, labeling him as "absolutely CRAZY" following recent extensive attacks on Ukrainian cities, primarily targeting civilians. This criticism came after a weekend marked by significant bombardments, despite Trump previously describing a phone call with Putin as productive. Historically, Trump has maintained a favorable view of his relationship with Putin, often refraining from linking Russian aggression to his own decisions regarding sanctions or military support for Ukraine. Analysts suggest that Trump's approach has created a strategic void, as he oscillates between expressing concern over Russia's actions and pulling back from commitments to support Ukraine or impose economic penalties on Russia. 

Trump's recent remarks indicate a shift in tone, acknowledging the severity of Putin's actions while still suggesting a desire for normalized relations with Russia post-conflict. However, he has shown reluctance to apply pressure on Russia, even amidst calls for increased sanctions from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump's disengagement from the conflict has drawn criticism, particularly regarding the U.S. position on international efforts to hold Russia accountable for war crimes. Ultimately, Trump’s varying stances reflect a complex relationship with both Putin and the ongoing war in Ukraine, leaving many questions about his influence and intentions in the situation.
