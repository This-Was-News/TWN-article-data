## Article summary
The ongoing feud between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro centers around claims about Tesla's reliance on imported parts. Navarro accused Musk of merely assembling cars from foreign-made components, while Musk countered that Tesla vehicles are predominantly built in America. Musk asserted that Tesla has the highest percentage of American-made cars and criticized Navarro's statements as false. Despite some reliance on third-party suppliers, Tesla is noted for its high level of vertical integration, producing significant components in-house, including batteries. 

Data shows that approximately 75% of the parts for Tesla's Model 3 Long Range are sourced from the U.S. or Canada, ranking it among the top vehicles for American-made content. In contrast, Navarro's comments highlight that other automakers may assemble vehicles using foreign parts, but this does not apply to Tesla. Analysts suggest that while tariffs could impact the auto industry, Tesla is projected to be less affected than its competitors. The discussion has broader implications regarding the nature of American manufacturing in the automotive sector.
