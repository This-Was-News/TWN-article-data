## Article summary
Ukrainians fear that a peace accord between President Trump and President Vladimir Putin, to be discussed in their upcoming summit in Alaska, may be negotiated without Ukrainian involvement. This concern stems from Trump's vague mention of land swaps and lack of discussion about security guarantees or arms supplies for Ukraine. Ukrainians worry that Trump's approach mirrors historical power dynamics, such as the Yalta conference, where great powers decided the fate of smaller nations, often with negative consequences. The Ukrainian government has swiftly rejected Trump's statements, highlighting the risks for Ukraine and the political stakes for Trump. The fear is that Trump may strike a deal directly with Putin, sidelining Ukraine's voice in determining its own future. This situation underscores the tension between great power negotiations and the autonomy of smaller nations. The article is written by David E. Sanger, a journalist with extensive experience in covering national security and foreign policy.
