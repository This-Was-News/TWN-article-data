## Article summary
The Trump administration has delayed and may cancel approximately $140 million in grants for the Overdose To Action (OD2A) program, which funds fentanyl overdose response efforts across 49 states and numerous local health departments. CDC staffers, speaking anonymously, expressed concerns that the funding disruption could lead to layoffs, program shutdowns, and a reversal of progress in reducing overdose deaths. Public health officials warn that the delay could cripple addiction treatment programs and surveillance systems crucial for detecting new dangerous substances in the drug supply. The Trump administration's actions, including potential cuts to Medicaid and the dissolution of key health agencies, threaten to undermine the nation's drug treatment safety net. Experts fear that these cuts could result in a significant increase in fatal overdoses, reversing recent declines in drug-related deaths.
