## Article summary
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was established by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide nonpartisan analysis of the budgetary impacts of proposed legislation, counterbalancing the executive branch's influence. Recently, the CBO faced criticism from Republicans, including President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, after projecting that a major GOP bill would increase federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over a decade. Critics have labeled the CBO as biased, but it operates under a strict nonpartisan mandate, employing around 275 professionals who produce approximately 1,000 cost estimates annually. While some estimates are straightforward, others, like terrorism risk insurance, are complex and challenging to predict accurately. Past criticisms have emerged from both political parties, with Democrats previously contesting CBO scores during the Affordable Care Act's legislative process. Despite allegations of partisanship, experts assert that the CBO maintains its objectivity and transparency, akin to the civil service. The agency does not make policy recommendations; it simply provides lawmakers with the financial implications of their proposals. Ultimately, the CBO's work is essential for Congress to have an independent understanding of budgetary matters, though it often becomes a target for political frustration.
