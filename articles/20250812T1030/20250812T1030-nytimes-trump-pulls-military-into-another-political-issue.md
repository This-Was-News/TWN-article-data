## Article summary
President Trump has ordered at least 800 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to address crime, despite falling crime rates. These troops will not perform law enforcement tasks but may temporarily detain individuals and support federal agents. This deployment follows other uses of the military for domestic policy, including border control and protest management. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the deployment, emphasizing the troops' strength and support role. Critics argue this is a misuse of the military for partisan political purposes. Military leaders aim to keep the rules of engagement narrow to avoid policing roles. The administration's pattern of using military resources for domestic goals has drawn criticism. Congress members and experts express concerns about the military's role in day-to-day policing. The deployment could impact military morale, recruitment, and retention. The D.C. National Guard's command structure gives the president broad control over its deployment.
