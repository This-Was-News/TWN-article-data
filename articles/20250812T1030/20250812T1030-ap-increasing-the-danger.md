## Article summary
The targeted killing of an Al Jazeera correspondent in Gaza by Israel has highlighted the extreme dangers faced by journalists in the region. Since October 2023, 184 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed in the Gaza war, compared to 18 in the Russia-Ukraine war. Israel has largely barred international media from covering the conflict, relying on local journalists who risk their lives to report. Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharf, who knew he was a target, left a message to be delivered upon his death. He and seven others, including journalists, were killed in an airstrike near Gaza City's largest hospital. Israel claimed al-Sharf led a Hamas cell, a claim denied by Al Jazeera. Despite the risks, journalists continue to report on the dire conditions in Gaza, including severe hunger and destruction. Al Jazeera's news director called on other organizations to step up their coverage. Many journalists in Gaza struggle to find food for themselves and their families. The lack of international condemnation for attacks on journalists raises concerns about future conflicts. The resilience of journalists in Gaza, despite the immense challenges, is notable.
