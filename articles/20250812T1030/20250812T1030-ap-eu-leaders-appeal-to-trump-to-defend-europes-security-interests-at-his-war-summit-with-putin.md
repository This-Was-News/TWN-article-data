## Article summary
European Union leaders urged U.S. President Donald Trump to uphold Europe's security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine. Concerns arise as Trump has suggested Ukraine may need to cede territory to Russia, which European leaders fear could lead to an unfavorable peace deal without Ukraine's involvement. The Europeans emphasize that any peace agreement must respect international law and Ukraine's sovereignty. Meanwhile, Russia continues its military offensive, with recent attacks on Ukrainian facilities and advances in the Donetsk region. Trump's public remarks have unsettled Ukraine's supporters, as he has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and praised Putin. European leaders will attempt to align Trump with Ukraine's cause in virtual meetings led by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. However, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, an ally of Putin, did not endorse the European statement. The outcome of the summit, set to take place in Alaska, remains uncertain, with significant implications for the ongoing conflict and regional stability.
