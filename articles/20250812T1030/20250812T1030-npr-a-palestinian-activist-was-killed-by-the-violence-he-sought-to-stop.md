## Article summary
Awdah Al Hathaleen, a 31-year-old Palestinian activist, father, and documentary filmmaker, was killed in the West Bank village of Umm al-Khair on July 31. He was shot by Ynon Lev, a notorious settler, who was briefly detained but released without charges. Hathaleen's body was held by Israeli authorities for 10 days before his funeral, attended by family, villagers, and a few journalists. His death mirrored events in the Oscar-winning documentary 'No Other Land,' which he helped make, highlighting the struggle of Palestinian villagers against settler violence. Hathaleen was known for his peaceful activism and education work, with friends worldwide mourning his loss. European diplomats and Israeli activists have expressed concern over the increasing settler attacks and the vulnerability of Palestinian communities. Since the war in October 2023, settler attacks have surged, with over 2,000 incidents recorded between January and June 2025, resulting in numerous casualties and property damage. Activists now stay overnight in Palestinian homes to protect them and document settler violence. Hathaleen's last message warned of settlers cutting water to his community. His mother recounted the events leading to his death, describing how he was struck while standing in a fenced area. Despite hopes that the documentary might bring protection, the situation has worsened, with settlers continuing to encroach on Palestinian land and perpetrate violence.
