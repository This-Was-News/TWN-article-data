## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of President Trump's immigration policies on factories, including GE Appliances and Kraft Heinz. These policies have led to the loss of immigrant workers, causing stress for remaining employees and employers. Jaeln Carpenter, a team leader at GE Appliances, describes the sudden departure of four co-workers due to changes in their immigration status, which has increased her workload and stress. The Trump administration ended programs like CHNV, which provided temporary permission for immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to stay and work in the U.S. This has affected over half a million immigrants and has left employers scrambling to fill the gaps. While GE Appliances maintains they are adequately staffed, there are concerns about future workforce shortages. Tom Torres, a mechanic at Kraft Heinz, highlights the contributions of immigrant workers and the emotional toll of their departures. The Greater Louisville Inc. chamber of commerce advocates for more immigration to address labor shortages. The article also notes the demographic changes in Louisville, where international migration is crucial for population growth and workforce needs. Additionally, the cancellation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for various countries could lead to further workforce reductions, with potential legal challenges pending.
