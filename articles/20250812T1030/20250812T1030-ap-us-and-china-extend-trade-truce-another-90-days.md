## Article summary
The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for another 90 days, delaying a potential economic showdown. President Trump signed the extension, maintaining all other elements of the agreement, while China also extended its tariff pause. This extension prevents the U.S. from increasing taxes on Chinese imports and China from raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports. The pause provides time for both countries to negotiate their differences and potentially pave the way for a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. U.S. businesses have welcomed the extension, hoping for improved market access in China and certainty for long-term planning. China has also agreed to extend relief to American companies previously placed on export control and unreliable entities lists. The U.S. has realized it does not have the upper hand in these negotiations, with both countries having demonstrated their ability to hurt each other economically. The Trump administration's trade policies have turned the U.S. into a protectionist fortress, with average tariffs rising significantly. However, China has also shown its leverage by controlling access to rare earth minerals crucial for various industries. Despite efforts to ease tensions, major issues such as intellectual property protection and industrial policies remain unresolved, suggesting the trade war will continue for years.
