## Article summary
President Trump views Washington, D.C. as a blighted property in need of repair, describing it as unsafe, dirty, and marred by crime and homelessness. He announced a temporary federal takeover of the city's police force, citing his real estate background as qualification for addressing these issues. Despite recent declines in violent crime, Trump promised to clean up the city, comparing his envisioned makeover to his recent renovations of the White House. Critics point out his history of invoking crime to stoke racial tensions and his family's past accusations of discrimination against Black tenants. Trump's policies have been criticized for not addressing underlying causes of poverty and crime, instead focusing on safety net program cuts and tax benefits for the wealthy. The federal government holds significant influence over Washington, with Trump able to nominate judges and approve city laws and budgets. The police union supported the takeover but emphasized it should be temporary. Trump's approach aligns with the 'broken windows' theory of policing, focusing on low-level offenses to prevent serious crime. Critics argue Trump is misrepresenting a vibrant city with diverse communities and that his actions threaten civil liberties. His past attempts to assert control over Washington include deploying federal agents during racial justice protests, contrasting with his pardon of Capitol rioters. Overall, Trump's real estate perspective shapes his views on urban issues and international conflicts.
