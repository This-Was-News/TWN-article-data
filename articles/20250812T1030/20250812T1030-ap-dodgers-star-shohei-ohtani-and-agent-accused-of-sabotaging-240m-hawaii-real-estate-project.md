## Article summary
A Hawaii real estate investor and broker have sued Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, alleging they sabotaged a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's Hapuna Coast. The lawsuit, filed in Hawaii Circuit Court, claims that Ohtani and Balelo exploited their celebrity status to destabilize and ultimately dismantle the plaintiffs' role in the project for financial self-interest. The suit accuses them of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, stating that Ohtani and Balelo used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray contractual obligations. The developers, Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and Tomoko Matsumoto, spent 11 years working on the deal and signed an endorsement deal with Ohtani in 2023 to elevate demand and create buzz in the Japanese luxury vacation home market. The lawsuit alleges that Balelo became a disruptive force, threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made. Kngsbarn Realty Capital, Ohtani's business partner, allegedly capitulated to Balelo's demands, leading to the termination of Hayes and Matsumoto last month. The plaintiffs stand to lose millions in projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions. Ohtani, a five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, signed a record $700 million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series. The lawsuit aims to hold Ohtani and Balelo accountable for their actions and ensure that contract rules and accountability apply equally to all, regardless of celebrity status.
