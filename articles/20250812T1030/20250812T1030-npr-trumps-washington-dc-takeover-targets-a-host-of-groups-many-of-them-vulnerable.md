## Article summary
President Trump announced a federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s Metro police and mobilization of the National Guard, aiming to target criminals, homeless people, and young individuals. He described the capital as overtaken by violent gangs, roving mobs of wild youth, and homeless people, despite crime rates being at a 30-year low. Trump plans to enforce harsh measures, including a purge of the homeless and aggressive policing for at least 30 days. Critics argue that displacing vulnerable groups could be devastating, as many lack support networks and healthcare. Residents like Will, a homeless man, express concerns about where they are supposed to go. Trump also mentioned plans to clear out what he described as the city's slums. Skepticism abounds regarding the effectiveness of Trump's approach, with some, like Howard University student Jehu King, believing it will cause more damage than solve problems. Others, like student Lala Zachary, see Trump's actions as intentional targeting of young people of color who advocate for change.
