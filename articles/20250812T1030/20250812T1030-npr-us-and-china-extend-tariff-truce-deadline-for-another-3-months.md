## Article summary
The U.S. and China have extended their tariff truce for another 90 days, avoiding a deadline that could have led to increased tariffs and a significant blow to trade between the two largest economies. President Trump acknowledged China's efforts to address American concerns on economic and national security matters. The extension allows both countries to continue negotiations on various issues, including trade imbalances, technology restrictions, and energy purchases. This move comes as the U.S. finalizes trade agreements with other countries like South Korea and Japan while maintaining high tariffs on nations like India. Analysts believe a trade agreement is likely, with the next steps possibly involving high-level meetings between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The truce follows a series of tariff hikes and responses earlier this year, which saw U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports reach 145% and China's tariffs on U.S. exports climb to 125%. Despite initial progress in May, both sides accused each other of not fully honoring the agreement. Recent talks in Stockholm did not result in a deal, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed optimism about reaching an agreement. The U.S. aims to reduce its trade deficit with China, diversify supply chains, and ensure stable access to rare earth minerals, while China seeks stability and access to American technologies. Trade between the two countries has declined since the beginning of the year, with China's exports to the U.S. falling for the fourth consecutive month.
