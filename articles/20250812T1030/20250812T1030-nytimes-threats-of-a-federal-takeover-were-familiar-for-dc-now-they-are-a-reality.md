## Article summary
The article discusses the unprecedented federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police force by President Donald Trump, marking the first time a president has exercised this power under federal law. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged the unsettling nature of this action but noted that it was not entirely surprising given Trump's previous rhetoric about the city. The Home Rule Act of 1973 grants D.C. some self-governance, but key aspects of its criminal justice system and budget are controlled by the federal government. Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and take over the police department highlights the city's vulnerability to federal intervention. Despite improvements in crime rates, Trump has consistently criticized D.C., describing it as crime-ridden and in need of liberation. Bowser has adopted a strategic approach to dealing with Trump, emphasizing shared goals and making concessions to avoid further conflict. Some council members argue that a more pragmatic approach could have mitigated the current situation. The article also notes the historical context of federal intervention in D.C., including a financial control board established in 1995. Experts and residents express concerns about the implications of Trump's actions, viewing them as a potential harbinger of further federal encroachment on the city's autonomy.
