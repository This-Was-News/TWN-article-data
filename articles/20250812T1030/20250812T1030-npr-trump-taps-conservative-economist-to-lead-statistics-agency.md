## Article summary
President Trump plans to nominate conservative economist E.J. Anton to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following the firing of the previous commissioner after disappointing jobs reports. Anton, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, is known for his conservative views. Trump announced the nomination on social media, praising Anton's commitment to honest and accurate data. If confirmed by the Senate, Anton will oversee the BLS, which produces crucial economic reports like the monthly jobs report and tracks inflation. The previous commissioner, Erka McEntarfer, was dismissed after reporting weaker-than-expected job gains, which Trump claimed were manipulated to make him look bad, a claim widely dismissed by independent economists. The BLS role is typically nonpartisan, raising concerns about the reliability of government economic data under Anton's leadership. Trump's decision to appoint a partisan economist to the position is likely to spark further debate about the impartiality of federal statistical agencies.
