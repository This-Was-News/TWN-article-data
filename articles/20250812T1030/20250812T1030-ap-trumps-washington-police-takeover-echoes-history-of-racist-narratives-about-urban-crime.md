## Article summary
President Donald Trump has taken control of Washington D.C.'s law enforcement and deployed National Guard troops, citing public safety concerns. His rhetoric echoes historical conservative narratives that have often targeted majority non-white cities as crime-ridden and in need of external intervention. Longtime residents and activists express alarm, seeing this as a violation of local agency and a repetition of past racist narratives. Trump's actions have raised concerns about potential abuses of power and civil rights violations, reminiscent of past federal interventions. Conservative politicians have a history of using similar language to justify increased law enforcement in cities with changing demographics. Local leaders, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have criticized Trump's actions and reasoning. Civil rights advocates view Trump's rhetoric as part of a broader political strategy to undermine local governance and justify federal takeover. Other cities, particularly those with Black mayors, are bracing for potential similar actions. The administration's move has sparked widespread criticism and concern about the erosion of local control and civil rights.
