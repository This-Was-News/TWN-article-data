## Article summary
Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement for the return of four bodies of Israeli hostages and the release of over 600 Palestinian prisoners, maintaining a fragile ceasefire. This development follows a series of negotiations and delays related to the release of the Palestinian detainees, which had been stalled due to accusations from both sides. An Israeli official confirmed that the agreement aligns with Israel's demands and involves the simultaneous handover of the hostages' bodies and the Palestinian prisoners. The hostages' bodies were expected to be returned late Wednesday or Thursday. 

The funerals for a young Israeli family, taken hostage during a Hamas-led attack in October 2023, were held recently, with their bodies returned to Israel the previous week. Under the broader ceasefire deal established in January, a significant swap was planned, including 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian detainees. The ceasefire has provided a pause in ongoing hostilities that have resulted in substantial casualties on both sides. The agreement is part of efforts to extend the ceasefire as negotiations continue with international mediators.
