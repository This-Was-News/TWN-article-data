## Article summary
President Trump left the G7 summit in Canada early to address the escalating conflict in the Middle East, emphasizing the urgency of his return to Washington. The summit, initially focused on trade, shifted to discussions about the Iran-Israel strikes, with leaders signing a joint statement affirming Israel's right to defend itself and condemning Iran's role in regional instability. Despite French President Macron's suggestion that Trump was working on a ceasefire proposal, Trump denied this on social media, hinting that his reasons for leaving were more significant. He expressed disappointment that Iran did not sign a proposed deal and urged immediate evacuation from Tehran. During a dinner meeting, G7 leaders called for a resolution to the Iranian crisis, linking it to broader de-escalation efforts in the region. Trump reiterated his stance on preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and indicated that Iran had shown interest in de-escalation talks. He stressed the need for Iran to engage in negotiations before it was too late, suggesting that they were not winning the conflict. Overall, Trump's departure underscored his prioritization of the Middle East crisis over the summit's discussions.
