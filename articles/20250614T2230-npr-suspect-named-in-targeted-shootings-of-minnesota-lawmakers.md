Minnesota officials have named 57-year-old Vance Boelter as the suspect in targeted shootings that left Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband dead, while state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded. The shootings occurred at the lawmakers' homes in Brooklyn Park and Champlin, respectively. Authorities are actively searching for Boelter, who is considered armed and dangerous, and residents have been advised to call 911 if they see him. The motive remains unclear, but a list of individuals, including other lawmakers, was found in Boelter's car, suggesting potential premeditation. Governor Tim Walz condemned the violence as a targeted political attack, emphasizing the importance of peaceful discourse in democracy. Following the shootings, the Minnesota State Patrol urged the public to avoid attending planned protests for safety reasons. Law enforcement has increased its presence in the area, and the FBI is involved in the investigation. Boelter has a history of involvement with state boards but is not registered with any political party. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of lawmakers amid a politically charged climate in Minnesota.
