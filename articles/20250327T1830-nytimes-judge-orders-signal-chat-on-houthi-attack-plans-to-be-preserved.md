## Article summary
A federal judge, James E. Boasberg, has ordered several Trump administration officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, to preserve messages exchanged in a Signal group chat regarding a military operation in Yemen. This order was prompted by a lawsuit from American Oversight, which alleges violations of federal records laws due to the use of the encrypted app for official discussions. The judge emphasized that the preservation order was to prevent any loss of messages, not an indication of wrongdoing by the officials involved.

The group chat reportedly included sensitive discussions about a military strike against Houthi rebels, and it was noted that a journalist inadvertently joined the conversation. The lawsuit aims to ensure that the complete record of communications remains intact. The Justice Department confirmed that one participant had already submitted his messages, while it remains unclear whether others have complied. The incident has raised significant concerns within the national security community about the use of commercial messaging platforms for official communications.
