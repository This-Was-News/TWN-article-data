## Article summary
Elon Musk's recent email to federal workers, asking them to report on their weekly accomplishments, has sparked confusion and frustration among employees. Musk claimed that failure to respond would be treated as a resignation, contradicting guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that states responses to such mass emails are voluntary. Many federal employees expressed concerns about the tone and implications of the email, which they felt undermined their professionalism. 

OPM had previously assured that engagement with these emails would be optional, highlighting the potential for misunderstanding among employees. Following the email, various federal agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Defense, advised their staff to refrain from responding until further notice. Critics, including union leaders, questioned the legality of OPM's request, arguing it overstepped its authority and conflicted with established regulations regarding employee management. 

Overall, the situation reflects ongoing tensions regarding new policies introduced by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, with many workers feeling undervalued and intimidated by the communication.
