## Article summary
The article discusses the benefits of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for tracking blood sugar levels, particularly for individuals without diabetes. Judy Freeman, a healthy 76-year-old, used a CGM to understand her fatigue and weight loss struggles. She discovered that her blood sugar dropped significantly after meals, leading to feelings of anxiety and hunger—common symptoms for those identified as "dippers." Research indicates that many people experience these dips, which can lead to overeating and mood fluctuations. To stabilize blood sugar levels, experts recommend combining carbohydrates with protein and healthy fats, spreading carb intake throughout the day, and altering the order of food consumption during meals. These strategies can help prevent the sharp rises and falls in blood sugar that contribute to fatigue and overeating. Ultimately, individuals can monitor their own responses to food without a CGM by noting how they feel after meals.
