## Article summary
Global leaders are actively seeking to influence President Trump's tariff plans, which aim to impose significant levies on many of America's trading partners. European officials have proposed removing tariffs on U.S. cars and industrial goods in exchange for similar concessions, while countries like Vietnam and Indonesia are making offers to lower their tariffs on American imports. Despite these overtures, Trump has indicated that tariffs will remain until U.S. trade deficits are addressed, particularly with China and the European Union. The impending tariffs, which range from 10% to 40%, are expected to impact nearly 60 countries and have already caused turmoil in stock markets.

Countries such as Canada and Mexico have been exempted from these tariffs, with Mexico highlighting its close trade relationship with the U.S. In contrast, European leaders are preparing retaliatory measures, while Japan and South Korea are seeking negotiations to reduce the impact of the tariffs on their economies. Trump's administration has shown mixed signals regarding negotiations, with some officials suggesting a willingness to engage while others emphasize the need to address non-tariff barriers. The situation remains fluid, as many nations are scrambling to establish discussions with the U.S. before the tariffs take effect.
