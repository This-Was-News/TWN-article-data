## Article summary
The Republican megabill introduces significant tax cuts early while delaying painful benefit cuts until after the 2026 midterm elections, aiming to minimize political backlash. Taxpayers may see larger refunds next spring, yet looming changes to Medicaid and aid programs pose future financial threats for lower-income families. The bill, which passed the Senate, is projected to add over $3 trillion to federal debt by 2034, with some Republicans expressing concerns about its impact on constituents. Key tax changes include an increase in the standard deduction and an expansion of the SALT cap, primarily benefiting wealthier households. Starting next year, stricter rules for health insurance enrollment and Medicaid eligibility will affect millions, with the most significant changes phased in after the midterms. The bill also includes cuts to SNAP, requiring more recipients to work for benefits, and potential state funding issues could further reduce aid. Additionally, clean energy subsidies face imminent cuts, with deadlines for tax breaks on electric vehicles and solar installations approaching quickly. Overall, the legislation reflects a strategic approach to balance immediate tax benefits against longer-term spending cuts that may harm vulnerable populations.
