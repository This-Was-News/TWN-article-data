## Article summary
Investors have reacted negatively to President Trump's recent tariff policy, leading to a significant decline in stock markets, with the S&P 500 dropping 6 percent in a single day and approaching bear market territory. This decline is attributed to the unprecedented scale of new tariffs, raising concerns of a potential recession, as analysts have increased the likelihood of economic downturns. The market's response reflects extreme pessimism, with $5 trillion in market value erased in just two days. Business leaders are expressing alarm over the sudden policy shifts, with many indicating plans to slow down investments due to increased uncertainty. While Trump remains steadfast in his approach, suggesting that the markets will eventually boom, analysts warn that the damage has already affected consumer and company behavior. The new tariffs are the highest seen since the 1930s, catching many investors off guard. Overall, the sentiment has shifted dramatically from optimism following Trump's election to severe market turbulence driven by his policy decisions.
