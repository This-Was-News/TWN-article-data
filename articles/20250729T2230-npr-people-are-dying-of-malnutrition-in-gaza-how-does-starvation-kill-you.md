## Article summary
The article discusses the severe malnutrition crisis in Gaza, where thousands, including a 9-year-old boy, are suffering from "catastrophic hunger" due to Israel's blockade and military offensive. The World Health Organization reports a "worst-case scenario of famine" in the region, with 63 deaths from malnutrition in July alone. The article outlines the five phases of starvation, detailing how the body breaks down its own energy stores, leading to muscle wasting, organ failure, and death. Pregnant women and children are particularly vulnerable, with long-term consequences for fetal development, growth, and overall health. The treatment for severe malnutrition is straightforward—food and water—but the crisis in Gaza and other regions highlights the urgent need for intervention to prevent further loss of life.
