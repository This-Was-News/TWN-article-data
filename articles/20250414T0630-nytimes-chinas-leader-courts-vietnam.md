## Article summary
President Xi Jinping of China is on a weeklong tour of Southeast Asia, starting in Vietnam, as he seeks to rally support against U.S. tariffs that threaten global manufacturing and economic growth. In an essay for Vietnamese media, Xi emphasized the need for stability, free trade, and cooperation, warning that there are no winners in trade wars. His visit aims to strengthen ties with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia while countering American influence. However, Vietnam must balance its relationships with both China and the U.S., as it faces significant tariffs that jeopardize its exports and foreign investments. Vietnamese officials are negotiating with Washington for lower tariffs while also trying to maintain a positive rapport with China. During Xi's visit, numerous agreements are expected to be signed, although many may lack specificity and depth. While Xi calls for maritime cooperation, Vietnam’s leaders are cautious due to ongoing tensions in the South China Sea. Analysts note that despite Xi's efforts, China's ability to support its neighbors is limited by its own economic struggles. The ongoing U.S.-China trade war complicates the situation, leaving countries like Vietnam in a precarious position.
