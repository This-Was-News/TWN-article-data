## Article summary
The article examines the challenges facing the Democratic Party regarding immigration policy, highlighting a significant shift in public opinion against more lenient immigration stances since 2019. During a primary debate, most candidates supported decriminalizing illegal border crossings, a position that has since alienated many voters, including working-class Latinos. As public support for stricter immigration policies rises, Democrats are grappling with how to recalibrate their approach without losing their core values. Some party members advocate for embracing conservative ideas, like restricting asylum qualifications, to regain credibility. However, others argue that adopting such measures would only serve to bolster the Trump administration's narrative against immigrants. The article notes the impact of recent migrant crises, particularly in border cities, which have strained local resources and shifted public sentiment. There is a notable divide within the party on how to address immigration, with some pushing for a more humane approach while others call for stricter enforcement. Amidst internal debates, Democrats face a significant trust gap with voters on immigration issues. The article concludes that unless Democrats articulate a clear, appealing vision for immigration reform, they risk continued electoral losses.
