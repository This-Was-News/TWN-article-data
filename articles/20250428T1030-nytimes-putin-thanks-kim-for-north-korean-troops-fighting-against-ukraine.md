## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have confirmed the deployment of North Korean troops in Russia's war against Ukraine, specifically in the Kursk region. Kim praised the heroism of these troops, stating their involvement was to strengthen the military alliance between the two nations, while also ordering a monument to honor fallen soldiers. Putin expressed gratitude for the contributions of North Korean special forces, emphasizing their sacrifices alongside Russian soldiers. This acknowledgment marks Russia's first official recognition of North Korean military support, which has included the deployment of approximately 14,000 troops and the provision of artillery and missiles. Analysts suggest that this military alliance is being leveraged as a negotiating tool against Ukraine, potentially impacting peace talks. Ukraine disputes Russia's claims of complete control over Kursk, asserting that its forces maintain positions there. The collaboration is seen as mutually beneficial, with North Korea gaining diplomatic leverage while providing military support to Russia. Concerns have been raised that North Korea might receive economic aid and advanced weapon technologies from Russia in exchange for its military assistance. The situation underscores the evolving dynamics between these two countries amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.
