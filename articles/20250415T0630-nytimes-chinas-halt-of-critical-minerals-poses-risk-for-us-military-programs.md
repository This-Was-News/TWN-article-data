## Article summary
China's recent decision to restrict exports of critical minerals, particularly rare earth elements essential for U.S. military technology, poses a significant risk to American national security. These minerals are crucial for various defense systems, including fighter jets, missiles, and drones, with 90% of rare earth magnets produced in China. Experts warn that this move serves as a warning to the Pentagon, highlighting the U.S. dependence on Chinese supply chains for defense materials. The restrictions could lead to increased costs for American defense contractors, who currently rely on limited stockpiles of these minerals. Historically, the U.S. was a leader in rare earth production but has since fallen behind, with the Mountain Pass mine in California now insufficient to meet demand. Previous instances, such as China’s 2010 trade halt with Japan, have underscored the vulnerabilities tied to reliance on Chinese resources. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have sought to enhance domestic production and stockpiles, but experts caution that current reserves may not last long enough. The situation echoes past wartime experiences where the U.S. had to find alternative sources for critical materials. Overall, the document emphasizes the urgent need for the U.S. to secure its supply chain for rare earth elements to maintain its defense capabilities.
