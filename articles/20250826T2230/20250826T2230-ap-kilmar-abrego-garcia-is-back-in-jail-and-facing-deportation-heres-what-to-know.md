## Article summary
Klmar Abrego Garca, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker, is facing deportation to Uganda after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Trump administration claims he is part of the MS-13 gang, an allegation he denies. Abrego Garca entered the U.S. illegally at 16, settled in Maryland, and started a family. He was deemed eligible for deportation in 2019 but not to El Salvador due to credible threats of violence. The administration initially deported him to El Salvador in March, violating a 2019 order, but his American wife successfully sued to bring him back in June. Upon his return, he was charged with human trafficking in Tennessee, charges his lawyers call preposterous. The administration is now trying to deport him again before his trial, citing him as a danger to the community. Abrego Garca has expressed fear of persecution and torture in Uganda and prefers deportation to Costa Rica. His lawyers argue that the U.S. is punishing him for fighting his deportation to El Salvador and seeking release from jail. The case has become a test of U.S. immigration powers, with courts and advocates insisting he be allowed to plead his case. Meanwhile, opposition figures in Uganda have criticized the agreement to receive deported immigrants, questioning the lack of parliamentary approval and the benefits for Uganda. The charges against Abrego Garca stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, where he was found with cash and undocumented passengers. Prosecutors and defense attorneys had been in confidential discussions about a plea agreement, but ICE informed his attorneys of their intention to deport him to Uganda shortly after his release from jail. Abrego Garca's defense team argues that the threat of deportation to Uganda is further proof of the vindictive nature of the criminal case and reason to dismiss it. The lawsuit filed by his lawyers seeks to ensure his constitutional rights, including immigration court proceedings and appeals, are respected.
