## Article summary
DNC Chair Ken Martin criticized President Trump, calling him a 'dictator-in-chief' and accusing him of promoting 'fascism dressed in a red tie.' Martin urged Democrats to stop bringing a 'pencil to a knife fight' and to fight back against Trump's policies more aggressively. He emphasized the need to win elections rather than just policy debates, stating that winning arguments doesn't improve lives. Martin has been working behind the scenes to support state and local parties, despite the Democratic Party's unpopularity. During the DNC's summer meeting in Minneapolis, Martin and other Democrats adopted a more aggressive stance, with Martin even referring to Trump as an 'orange bastard.' Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Texas House Minority Leader Rep. Gene Wu also spoke, highlighting their efforts to resist Republican policies and support Democratic initiatives. Democrats face significant challenges in the 2026 midterm elections, with tough Senate races expected in several key states.
