## Article summary
Bill Pulte, the country's top housing regulator, has been targeting political enemies of President Donald Trump, using property records to accuse them of mortgage fraud and encouraging criminal investigations. Recently, Trump used allegations published by Pulte to attempt to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve board, as part of his effort to exert more control over the central bank. Pulte claims Cook designated two homes as her primary residence to secure better mortgage rates, leading to a potential legal battle. Pulte has also targeted Democrats like Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James but has ignored similar cases involving Republicans like Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Pulte's actions have raised questions about the use of government resources and his political motivations. Beyond mortgages, Pulte has supported Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over expensive renovations. Pulte's background includes a home-building fortune and previous online philanthropy efforts aimed at gaining Trump's attention. His political donations and the subsequent FEC investigation have raised further concerns about his appointment and potential conflicts of interest.
