## Article summary
A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Maryland's entire federal bench, calling it 'potentially calamitous.' Judge Thomas Cullen, a Trump appointee, criticized the administration's attacks on the judiciary, noting recent derogatory labels used by White House officials. The lawsuit challenged an order by the chief judge of the Maryland district court that paused the immediate deportation of immigrants seeking review of their detentions. Cullen ruled that allowing the suit to proceed would defy precedent and offend the rule of law, emphasizing the importance of respecting the judiciary's constitutional role. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, arguing that the Maryland court's order undermines the president's authority to enforce immigration laws. The lawsuit, filed in June, was seen as an unprecedented legal maneuver, reflecting growing tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary. The Maryland judges, represented by conservative lawyer Paul Clement, argued that the administration's suit sought to limit judicial review of immigration proceedings. Among the judges named in the suit was Paula Xinis, who had ruled against the administration in a high-profile deportation case. Cullen noted the unusual circumstance of the entire Maryland federal bench being named as defendants, describing the lawsuit as a 'potentially calamitous' litigation against a co-equal branch of government.
