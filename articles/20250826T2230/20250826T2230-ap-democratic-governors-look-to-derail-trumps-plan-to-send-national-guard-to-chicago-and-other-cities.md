## Article summary
Democratic governors, including Illinois' JB Pritzker, are opposing President Donald Trump's plan to send National Guard troops to cities like Chicago and Baltimore, arguing that federal intervention is neither wanted nor needed. Pritzker, joined by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, emphasized local efforts to reduce crime and criticized Trump's approach as politically motivated. Trump's strategy aims to bolster his 'law and order' image and portray Democratic leaders as ineffective, despite exaggerating crime rates. Democrats view this as an overreach and an opportunity to highlight their public safety policies, though they acknowledge the political risks. Meanwhile, Trump's focus on specific cities raises questions about his selective approach, with some Republican leaders also supporting local control over federal intervention.
