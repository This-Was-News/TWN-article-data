## Article summary
President Trump has claimed the authority to remove a member of the Federal Reserve board, Lisa D. Cook, for not complying with his demands to lower interest rates. This move is part of a broader pattern of Trump's efforts to consolidate power over American government and society, challenging the independence of the Federal Reserve, which was designed to be free from White House control. The attempt to fire Ms. Cook raises legal questions about whether the president alone can decide if there is sufficient cause for removal or if courts can intervene. Trump's actions align with his previous efforts to expand executive power, such as declaring emergencies, deploying troops, raising import taxes, and blocking congressional spending. The Federal Reserve's independence is crucial for making economic decisions based on long-term health rather than short-term political interests. While the Supreme Court has signaled reluctance to undermine the Fed's independence, Trump is proceeding with his plan, citing allegations of misconduct by Ms. Cook. Ms. Cook and her lawyer have vowed to fight the removal, arguing that Trump lacks legal authority. The case may hinge on whether courts can review the president's decision and whether they will accept Trump's justification as legitimate. Trump's letter suggests he believes his determination cannot be questioned, setting up a potential legal battle over executive power and judicial oversight.
