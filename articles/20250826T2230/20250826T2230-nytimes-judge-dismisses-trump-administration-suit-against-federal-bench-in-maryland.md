## Article summary
A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the entire federal bench in Maryland, which challenged a standing order to slow down the government's ability to deport undocumented immigrants. Judge Thomas T. Cullen, appointed by President Trump, described the suit as novel and potentially calamitous, suggesting simpler and more legal ways to contest the order. The unusual nature of the case required all district judges in Maryland to recuse themselves, with Judge Cullen presiding from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Virginia. In his ruling, Judge Cullen criticized the Trump administration for repeatedly attacking judges who ruled against the White House, labeling them with derogatory terms. He noted that while tension between branches of government is normal, the concerted effort to smear judges was unprecedented and unfortunate. The judge's 39-page ruling highlighted the extraordinary and unorthodox nature of the lawsuit, emphasizing the lack of legal precedent for such actions.
