## Article summary
The Israeli military claimed that strikes on a Gaza hospital targeted a Hamas surveillance camera, but the first strike killed a Reuters cameraman and a hospital worker. The military provided no evidence for its assertions, including that six of the dead were militants. Witnesses and hospital officials contradicted the military's account, stating that the second strike hit a group of people, including medical workers and journalists, on a staircase. The Israeli military is conducting an ongoing investigation into the strikes, which have drawn international condemnation. The strikes occurred amid a surge of outrage and unanswered questions, with international leaders and rights groups condemning the attacks. The Israel-Hamas war has been particularly deadly for media workers, with 189 Palestinian journalists killed in 22 months of fighting. Meanwhile, protests in Israel demanded the release of hostages and an end to the war, while Palestinians in Gaza braced for an expanded Israeli offensive. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the offensive in Gaza City, stating that it was necessary to defeat Hamas and secure the release of hostages. The conflict has resulted in a high number of casualties, with Gaza's Health Ministry reporting 62,819 deaths, though Israel disputes these figures.
