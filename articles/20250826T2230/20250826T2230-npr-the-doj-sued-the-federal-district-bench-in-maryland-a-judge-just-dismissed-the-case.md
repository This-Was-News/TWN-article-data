## Article summary
A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland. The DOJ had argued that the Maryland court exceeded its authority by imposing a temporary 48-hour freeze on deportations, but Judge Thomas Cullen ruled that the case should not have been brought in this manner. Cullen stated that the dispute between the executive and judicial branches could not be litigated in a district court by suing all the judges. The DOJ had claimed that judges, like other government officials, sometimes violate the law, but Cullen argued that the DOJ could have appealed specific decisions or petitioned the judicial council to change local rules. The judges were represented by prominent Supreme Court advocate Paul Clement, who noted that there is no precedent for such a lawsuit against a co-equal branch of government. The judges received support from various legal organizations and retired federal judges. The case stems from the deportation of Klmar Abrego Garca, an El Salvadoran man who was deported despite a judicial order, due to what the DOJ called an administrative error. Garca has since returned to the U.S. and is now in federal custody, fighting criminal charges and another deportation.
