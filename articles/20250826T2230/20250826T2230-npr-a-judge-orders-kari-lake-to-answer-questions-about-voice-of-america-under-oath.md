## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered Kari Lake, a Trump administration official, to testify under oath regarding her efforts to dismantle Voice of America (VOA) despite congressional mandates. Judge Royce C. Lamberth criticized Lake for failing to comply with court orders and accused her of verging on contempt. Lake, who has been sued by VOA's director, journalists, and other groups, has been accused of acting hastily and violating legal safeguards. She has fired hundreds of contract workers, placed full-time employees on permanent leave, and reduced VOA's broadcasts from 49 languages to four. Lamberth has ruled that VOA must be restored to full power to comply with federal law. Lake's actions, including seeking to defund sister networks and remove VOA's director, have been challenged in court. The judge questioned the government's defense and Lake's compliance with federal law, emphasizing Congress's constitutional role. Lake's appointment as acting CEO is also under scrutiny, as she lacks the required Senate confirmation.
