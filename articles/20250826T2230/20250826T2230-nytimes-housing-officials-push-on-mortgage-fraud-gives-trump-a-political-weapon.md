## Article summary
Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has been targeting political enemies of President Trump, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Recently, Pulte accused Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, leading to her firing by President Trump. Pulte alleged that Cook falsified records to obtain favorable mortgage terms, a claim Cook denies. Cook plans to challenge her dismissal in court. Trump has been critical of the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates and has appointed loyalists to the board. Mortgage fraud, though relatively rare, can result in lower interest rates and better loan terms. Pulte, with a significant social media following, has used his position to investigate and attack Trump's political opponents. He has also taken steps to reduce fraud in mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which he now chairs. Pulte's actions have transformed the typically low-profile housing agency into a tool for Trump's political agenda.
