## Article summary
The United States has imposed a 25 percent tariff on imported auto parts, which is expected to significantly increase prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repair costs and insurance premiums. This move, part of President Trump's strategy to promote domestic manufacturing, follows previous tariffs on imported cars. The tariffs aim to protect national security and reduce reliance on foreign automobile imports, although they will not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico under certain trade agreement conditions. While some automakers may receive temporary relief from certain duties, overall car prices are projected to rise, contributing to inflation. The tariffs are anticipated to strain the auto industry, potentially leading to parts shortages and financial stress for suppliers. Companies like General Motors, which relies more on imported parts, may be hit harder than others like Tesla and Ford, which manufacture a larger percentage of their vehicles domestically. The uncertainty surrounding these tariffs is complicating financial forecasts for automakers, with General Motors estimating a potential $5 billion loss this year due to the tariffs. Despite current inventories mitigating immediate price hikes, car manufacturers are unlikely to absorb increased costs indefinitely.
