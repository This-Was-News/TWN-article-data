## Article summary
Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old U.S. college student from Virginia, went missing in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, while on spring break with friends. Surveillance footage captured her entering a beach area near a Riu hotel in the early hours of March 10, shortly before her disappearance. Joshua Riibe, a 22-year-old from Iowa, has been named a person of interest, as he may have been the last person to see her, although he is not considered a suspect. Inconsistencies in interviews with her travel companions have raised concerns for investigators. 

The U.S. Embassy notified Dominican authorities of her disappearance, prompting a comprehensive search effort involving land, air, and water resources, including drones and canines. The investigation is a collaboration between the U.S. State Department, FBI, and Dominican police, with Riu Hotels also assisting. Konanki's family has expressed their hope for a thorough investigation, and the Loudoun County sheriff's office has requested an Interpol yellow notice to aid in locating her. Public speculation surrounding her case has been cautioned against by authorities, emphasizing the need for careful investigation before reaching conclusions.
