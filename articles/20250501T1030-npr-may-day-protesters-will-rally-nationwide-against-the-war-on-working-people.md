## Article summary
May Day protests are set to take place nationwide against the Trump administration, with tens of thousands expected to participate. Activists are rallying on May 1, traditionally recognized as International Labor Day, to voice their opposition to policies perceived as harmful to the working class, particularly targeting labor rights and immigrant safety. The initiative, called May Day Strong, emphasizes the threats posed by the administration and its wealthy supporters, highlighting issues like defunding public services and attacking unions. Despite the U.S. not officially recognizing May Day, grassroots efforts have continued since the 19th century, rooted in historical labor strikes. The protests are seen as a response to past and ongoing injustices, including immigration policies and job cuts. This year’s events are anticipated to be the largest in history, with over 1,000 planned across various cities. Labor history experts suggest this movement reflects a broader coalition of participants compared to previous years. The protests aim to reclaim power from corporate elites and challenge the narrative surrounding working-class unity.
