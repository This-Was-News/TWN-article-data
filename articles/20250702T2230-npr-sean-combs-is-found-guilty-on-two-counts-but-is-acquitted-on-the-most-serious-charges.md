## Article summary
Sean Combs, the hip-hop mogul known as Diddy, was found guilty by a federal jury in Manhattan on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, while being acquitted of more serious charges including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The jury's decision followed 13 hours of deliberation after a trial that began on May 5. Prosecutors failed to convince the jury that Combs' ex-girlfriends participated non-consensually in the events described as "freak offs" or "wild king nights." Combs did not testify, and his defense highlighted texts indicating the women's initial enthusiasm for these encounters, despite their later claims of feeling pressured. The prosecution could not establish that Combs operated a criminal conspiracy, which would have warranted harsher penalties. A racketeering conviction could have led to life imprisonment, while the transportation charges carry a maximum of 10 years each. Outside of the criminal trial, Combs faces numerous civil lawsuits, including a recent $20 million settlement with Ventura, who did not require him to admit wrongdoing. Combs, a three-time Grammy winner, was influential in popularizing hip-hop through his label, Bad Boy Records, and other business ventures.
