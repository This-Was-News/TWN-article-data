## Article summary
China has vowed to retaliate vigorously against President Trump's latest tariff threats, which include imposing a 50% tariff on Chinese imports unless Beijing retracts a 34% retaliatory tariff it announced. In a statement, China's commerce ministry declared that the country will take resolute countermeasures to protect its rights and interests, emphasizing that it will not accept what it perceives as U.S. blackmail. As tensions escalate in the ongoing trade war, the U.S. has already applied tariffs totaling 104% on Chinese goods this year, following Trump's initial tariffs of 20% and an additional 34%. 

Despite the aggressive stance from the U.S., other nations, including Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, have refrained from retaliatory tariffs, opting instead for negotiation. Vietnam, facing high tariffs, has sent a special envoy to the U.S. seeking a delay in tariff implementation while discussions are underway. Meanwhile, the European Commission is considering countermeasures but also advocates for a negotiated resolution to avoid further escalation. Analysts suggest that China is prepared for a prolonged economic confrontation, believing it has built resilience against U.S. pressures over the years. Overall, the situation reflects a significant intensification of economic hostilities between the two largest economies in the world.
