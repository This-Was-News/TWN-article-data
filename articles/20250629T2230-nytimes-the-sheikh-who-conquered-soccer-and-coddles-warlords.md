## Article summary
Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the UAE is a wealthy and influential figure known for his ownership of Manchester City and his role in regional politics. In early 2023, he hosted Sudanese commander Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, who has been implicated in a brutal civil war and numerous atrocities. Following the outbreak of conflict in Sudan, Sheikh Mansour allegedly aided Hamdan's forces by facilitating arms smuggling under the guise of humanitarian efforts. Despite the UAE's denial of involvement, U.S. intelligence has linked Mansour to communications with Hamdan, suggesting a significant role in escalating the conflict. Sheikh Mansour, often overshadowed by his more prominent siblings, has been described as a key player in the UAE's strategy to expand influence in Africa and the Middle East, often forging ties with autocrats and warlords. His public persona remains low-key, yet he has been central to the Emirati government's aggressive foreign policy. The ongoing war in Sudan has led to increased scrutiny of the UAE's actions, including calls from U.S. lawmakers to halt weapons sales to the Emirates. Additionally, Manchester City faces serious allegations of financial misconduct, which could jeopardize its success and bring further attention to Sheikh Mansour's dealings. Overall, Sheikh Mansour's dual role in sports and international relations highlights the complexities of Emirati ambitions on the global stage.
