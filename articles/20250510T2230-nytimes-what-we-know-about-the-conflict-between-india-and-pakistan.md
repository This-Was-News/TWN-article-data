## Article summary
India and Pakistan announced a cease-fire following intense fighting, marked by missile, drone, and artillery strikes, after a terrorist attack in Kashmir left 26 dead. Despite the cease-fire, reports of ongoing violence emerged, with both nations accusing each other of violations. The conflict was exacerbated by accusations from India against Pakistan regarding the attack, which was claimed by a group linked to a Pakistani terrorist organization. President Trump announced the cease-fire, asserting U.S. mediation, though India disputed this claim.

As tensions persisted, officials from both countries exchanged accusations of breaking the truce, while international players like Saudi Arabia and the U.S. urged restraint. The Kashmir dispute dates back to the 1947 partition of British India, leading to unresolved territorial claims and military confrontations. Over the decades, Pakistan has been accused of supporting militant groups in Kashmir, contributing to an ongoing insurgency. The region remains heavily militarized, with previous escalations bringing both nations to the brink of war.
