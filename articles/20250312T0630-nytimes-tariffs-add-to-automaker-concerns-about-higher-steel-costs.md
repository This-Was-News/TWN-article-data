## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on the U.S. auto industry. Automakers are concerned that these tariffs will increase production costs, particularly as they were already facing rising steel prices due to other policies. A key issue for the industry is Trump's opposition to the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel, which automakers believed would enhance competition and lower prices. Currently, U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs are the only significant American producers of high-finish steel, and there are fears that a merger between them could lead to monopolistic pricing. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation supports the Nippon Steel acquisition, arguing it would help maintain competitive pricing. Despite attempts to revive the deal, Trump has reiterated his stance against foreign control of U.S. Steel. The new tariffs are expected to raise steel prices by about 16% compared to 2024, further squeezing automaker profits amidst challenges like competition from Chinese firms and technological transitions. Overall, the tariffs add to the pressures faced by an already struggling auto industry.
