## Article summary
President Trump's recent executive order aims to "restore truth and sanity to American history" by directing the Department of the Interior to address the status of monuments, statues, and memorials that have been removed or altered since 2020. The order seeks to eliminate "divisive race-centered ideology" from the Smithsonian's institutions and to ensure that historical representations do not disparage Americans, focusing instead on their achievements. It mandates the restoration of any memorials deemed to have been unjustly removed or modified, although the exact impact and number of affected sites remain unclear.

The order comes in the context of a national reckoning on race that intensified after George Floyd's murder, leading to the removal of numerous Confederate symbols across the country. Critics, including experts from the Southern Poverty Law Center, express concern that the order may minimize the significance of slavery in American history and threaten the recognition of contributions from racial minorities. Additionally, the National Park Service has begun revising its websites in line with the administration's directives, including the removal of references to transgender individuals.

The National Parks Conservation Association has voiced apprehension regarding the implications of the executive order on the narrative of American history within national parks. Experts argue that controlling monuments cannot dictate historical memory, as many alternative narratives exist outside of physical representations. Overall, the executive order reflects a contentious debate over how American history is portrayed and remembered.
