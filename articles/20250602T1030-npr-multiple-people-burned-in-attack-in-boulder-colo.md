## Article summary
On June 1, 2025, an antisemitic attack occurred at Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, where a man, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, threw incendiary devices at participants of a vigil for Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Eight individuals, aged 52 to 88, were injured, with two requiring airlift to a burn unit. The attack unfolded during a peaceful event organized by Run For Their Lives, which has been held weekly since the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas. Witnesses described the attacker using a makeshift flamethrower, and the area was subsequently cordoned off by police for investigation. Local officials condemned the violence, labeling it a hate crime, and expressed concerns about rising antisemitism. Boulder City Councilwoman Tara Winer noted the close-knit nature of the Jewish community, many of whom were affected by the attack. Political leaders, including Colorado Governor Jared Polis and Rep. Joe Neguse, emphasized the need to combat hatred and violence against the Jewish community. The incident has drawn national attention, highlighting a disturbing trend of antisemitism in the country.
