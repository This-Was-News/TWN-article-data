## Article summary
Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, has announced bipartisan support for a bill aimed at limiting President Trump's authority to impose tariffs, which she describes as an "economic nightmare." The proposed legislation, co-authored with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, would require the president to notify Congress of any impending tariffs within 48 hours and seek approval within 60 days. This response comes as concerns grow over the economic impact of Trump's tariffs on consumers and markets. Cantwell emphasizes that constituents are expressing frustration over rising prices due to these tariffs, which she argues are misused presidential powers.

Currently, seven Republican senators support the bill, indicating a growing bipartisan effort. However, Trump has threatened to veto the legislation, raising questions about its future. Cantwell believes that there is a viable path for the bill to pass, as many are recognizing the negative effects of the tariffs. She advocates for a more collaborative approach to trade, suggesting that the U.S. should work with allies to address issues like the trade deficit, rather than alienating them. Overall, the proposed legislation reflects a significant push within Congress to reassert control over trade policy amidst ongoing economic challenges.
