## Article summary
The Justice Department's civil rights division is experiencing a significant exodus of staff, with hundreds of lawyers and employees leaving due to changes in mission under the Trump administration. The administration's new focus is on pursuing cases against Ivy League schools, liberal cities, and police departments, shifting away from traditional civil rights protections for marginalized communities. Over 100 attorneys are expected to take advantage of a deferred resignation program, leaving the division with potentially only about 140 lawyers. Harmeet K. Dhillon, the new head of the division, has expressed approval of the turnover, stating that the division should not be focused on "woke ideology." The changes signal a broader transformation, with critics arguing that the division is being weaponized against the communities it was meant to protect. Current and former staff members are alarmed by new mission statements that alter the division's core functions. The administration is also pushing investigations into antisemitism related to campus protests and reassigning lawyers to focus on issues aligned with its agenda, such as preventing transgender students from participating in women’s sports. This shift has raised concerns about the ability of the division to uphold existing civil rights laws. Experts warn that the changes could lead to increased discrimination and constitutional violations across various sectors.
