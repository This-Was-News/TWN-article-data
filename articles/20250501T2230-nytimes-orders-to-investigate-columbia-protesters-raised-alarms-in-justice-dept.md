## Article summary
The Justice Department's aggressive investigation into Columbia University student protesters, ordered by a Trump appointee, has raised significant concerns among career prosecutors who view it as politically motivated and lacking legal basis. The inquiry was initiated following protests against Israel's actions in Gaza, leading to fears of First Amendment violations. A federal magistrate judge expressed skepticism about the investigation's legitimacy, particularly regarding demands for a membership list from a student group and the application for a search warrant related to their social media. Internal tensions within the Justice Department have escalated, with many lawyers resisting actions they deemed improper or unjustified. The investigation appears to have stalled, but its implications have deepened distrust between political appointees and career attorneys within the department. Critics, including legal experts, have condemned the approach as a misuse of prosecutorial power aimed at intimidating student activists. The Trump administration's broader agenda includes cracking down on campus protests perceived as antisemitic. Despite the investigation's decline, the potential for its revival remains, highlighting ongoing conflicts within the Justice Department.
