## Article summary
The Trump administration has intensified checks on unaccompanied migrant children, with Homeland Security agents conducting unannounced visits across the U.S. to ensure these children are safe and enrolled in school. Critics argue that these visits, framed as wellness checks, are actually a guise for immigration enforcement, leading to fears among immigrant communities and educators. Many of these children live safely with family, but some face risks of exploitation. The involvement of the Office of Refugee Resettlement in these checks has raised concerns, as this agency traditionally focused on child welfare, not immigration enforcement. The administration has also hired detention specialists, indicating a shift in policy. Advocates worry that the checks could lead to family separations, recalling past instances where children were taken from their parents. Legal representation for minors has been threatened due to funding cuts, exacerbating their vulnerability in immigration proceedings. Proposed legislation could impose financial burdens on sponsors of unaccompanied minors, making reunification difficult. Overall, these developments threaten the safety and well-being of vulnerable children seeking refuge in the U.S.
