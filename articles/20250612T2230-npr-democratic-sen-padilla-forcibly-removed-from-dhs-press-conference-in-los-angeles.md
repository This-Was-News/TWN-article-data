## Article summary
Democratic Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press conference led by Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. The press conference focused on immigration enforcement and related protests. Padilla attempted to ask a question but was subdued by federal agents, handcuffed, and later released without arrest. Noem's statement accused Padilla of "disrespectful political theatre" and claimed he failed to comply with requests to back away, although Padilla asserted he had identified himself. He explained he was present for a scheduled briefing and sought more information about Noem's conference after struggling to meet with DHS officials. Video footage of the incident circulated widely, prompting reactions from prominent Democrats, including California Governor Gavin Newsom. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed outrage over Padilla's treatment, demanding answers regarding the incident. The occurrence fueled further condemnation of the Trump administration's immigration actions from Senate Democrats, with Senator Adam Schiff questioning the implications for democracy. The situation has sparked significant political discourse and concern over the treatment of lawmakers.
