## Article summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is set to fully fund the Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program ahead of a key budget deadline, according to a senior CDC leader. Previously withheld funds for other CDC programs, including rape and domestic violence prevention, are also being released. The delays were part of broader funding issues at the CDC, which had been receiving minimal funds for months. Health departments across the country faced challenges as deadlines for CDC funding for various programs, including HIV prevention, cancer registries, and overdose prevention, approached or passed. While the release of funds is seen as a relief, concerns remain about the impact of the delays and the lack of a clear strategy from the Trump administration and the Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, several dozen specific CDC programs have had their budget lines frozen, including those addressing tobacco use, nutrition, physical activity, and injury prevention.
