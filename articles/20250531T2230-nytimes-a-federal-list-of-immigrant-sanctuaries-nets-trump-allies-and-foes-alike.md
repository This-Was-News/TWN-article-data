## Article summary
The federal government recently released a list of over 600 cities, counties, and states labeled as sanctuary jurisdictions, claiming they obstruct federal immigration enforcement. This inclusion surprised many local officials, such as Huntington Beach's mayor, who emphasized their non-sanctuary status. The list was mandated by an executive order and threatens jurisdictions with the loss of federal contracts. While some places on the list had self-identified as sanctuaries, others, like Kit Carson County, were perplexed by their designation despite supporting immigration enforcement. Many officials speculated that confusion over local resolutions, such as those related to gun rights or abortion, may have contributed to their inclusion. Additionally, some jurisdictions believed their past interactions with federal immigration authorities might have led to their listing. Meanwhile, certain cities, like Santa Ana, were relieved to find themselves absent from the list despite having enacted sanctuary policies. The lack of a universal definition for sanctuary cities complicates the situation further, as different jurisdictions operate under varying policies. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the list would be regularly updated and reviewed, leaving many local governments uncertain about compliance.
