## Article summary
President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming it's deserved due to the institution's perceived shortcomings. Harvard responded by asserting that there is no legal basis for such a move and warned that losing this status would severely impact its financial aid, research programs, and overall educational mission. The university has not committed to a legal challenge but emphasized the potential grave consequences for higher education. The IRS, which would be responsible for any revocation, has not indicated that it is taking action, as federal law prohibits direct presidential influence over tax investigations. Harvard's tax-exempt status allows it to avoid most taxes and enables donors to receive tax deductions, with philanthropy making up a significant portion of its revenue. The ongoing conflict is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration against elite universities, which have been labeled as centers of antisemitism and discrimination. Harvard has resisted several demands from the government and previously sued over the freezing of federal funds in retaliation for its noncompliance. Critics warn against politicizing the IRS, highlighting the importance of uniform and neutral tax policies. Democratic senators have called for an investigation into Trump's targeting of Harvard, asserting it may be illegal and unconstitutional. Despite the tensions, experts believe that a court would likely side with Harvard if the IRS pursued revocation of its tax status.
