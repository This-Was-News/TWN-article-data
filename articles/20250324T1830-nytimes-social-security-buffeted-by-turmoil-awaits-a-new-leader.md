## Article summary
The article discusses the current turmoil surrounding the Social Security Administration (SSA) as it awaits a new leader, Frank Bisignano, appointed by President Trump. Bisignano, a Wall Street veteran, will face Congress amidst concerns over the agency's management and its ability to provide benefits to 73 million Americans. Elon Musk has raised alarms about potential fraud within the SSA, a claim experts dispute, leading to increased scrutiny and internal changes that have caused anxiety among beneficiaries. The acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, has made controversial decisions, including threatening to shut down critical systems and reversing policies that previously eased access to benefits. Many Democratic lawmakers fear the administration is setting the SSA up for failure, urging Bisignano to commit to not privatizing the agency. Employees report heightened stress and confusion among the public, with many worried about the impact of changes on their access to benefits. Bisignano aims to apply technological solutions to identify fraud, waste, and abuse without affecting benefits. The administration's aggressive approach to the SSA poses significant political risks, especially given its importance to older Americans, a key voting demographic. As the agency faces staffing cuts and operational challenges, employees express concerns about their ability to serve the public effectively. Overall, the SSA's future remains uncertain amid these significant upheavals.
