## Article summary
President Trump announced that his administration is nearing a peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, two nations with a long-standing conflict. This statement was made during an Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Trump credited Massad Boulos, a senior adviser for Africa, with facilitating the peace process, noting that both countries had submitted draft agreements which have been combined into a final proposal. The conflict has persisted for three decades, with recent violence stemming from the Rwanda-backed M23 militia's invasion of Congo in late 2021. 

In February, Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi expressed willingness to share his country's mineral resources with the U.S. and Europe, seeking assistance in compelling Rwanda to withdraw its forces. Following Boulos' visit to Congo, both nations signed a commitment to pursue peace and enhance cooperation with U.S. investors, particularly in mining and infrastructure. Despite ongoing fighting in eastern Congo, Ramaphosa highlighted international efforts for a cease-fire, mentioning South Africa's troop withdrawal to support peace initiatives. Overall, the document underscores the complex geopolitical dynamics and the involvement of international actors in the Congo-Rwanda conflict.
