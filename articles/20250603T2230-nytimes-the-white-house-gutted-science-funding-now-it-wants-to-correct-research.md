## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's executive order aimed at establishing a so-called "gold standard" for science across federal agencies, which has raised significant concerns among the scientific community. Critics, including over 6,000 scientists, argue that the order undermines scientific independence by placing political appointees in charge of vetting and correcting scientific research, potentially leading to censorship. The administration has already cut funding for the National Science Foundation and removed staff from key environmental agencies, prompting fears about the erosion of scientific capacity. The order's emphasis on reproducibility and unbiased peer review is seen as a misappropriation of open science principles to impose political control over scientific inquiry. Notably, the order targets climate change research and criticizes studies that present worst-case scenarios, which scientists argue are essential for comprehensive risk assessment. Additionally, it undermines diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations in research funding. The article highlights a historical precedent of state manipulation of science, warning against the dangers of politicizing scientific truths. Overall, the executive order is perceived as a threat to scientific integrity and autonomy, reflecting a broader distrust of government among the public.
