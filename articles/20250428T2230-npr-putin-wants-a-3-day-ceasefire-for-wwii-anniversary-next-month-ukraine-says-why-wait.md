## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine starting May 8 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. This ceasefire is intended for "humanitarian reasons," but Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has called for an immediate, longer truce of 30 days instead. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of valuing human lives over ceremonial observances. 

The Kremlin has warned that Russian forces will remain on alert during the ceasefire and will respond if Ukraine violates it. Previous ceasefire attempts, such as the Easter truce, have failed to hold. Ukraine shifted its observance of Victory Day to May 8, aligning with most European nations, following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Amid these developments, U.S. President Trump has expressed frustration with both Russia and Ukraine, urging for a permanent ceasefire and questioning Putin's commitment to ending the war. The situation remains tense, with ongoing military activity despite calls for peace.
