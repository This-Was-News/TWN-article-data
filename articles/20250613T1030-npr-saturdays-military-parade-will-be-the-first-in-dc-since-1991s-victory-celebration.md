## Article summary
The upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday marks the first such event since the National Victory Celebration in 1991, which honored returning veterans of the Persian Gulf War. Scheduled for June 14, the parade coincides with the 79th birthday of President Trump and celebrates the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The last military parade was held 34 years ago, following a swift and decisive operation that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. President George H.W. Bush led the celebration, which featured M1 Abrams tanks and thousands of troops, reminiscent of post-World War II victory parades. The 1991 event was not without controversy, facing criticism for its militaristic tone and expense, alongside protests from anti-war activists. Despite some dissent, public sentiment largely supported the Gulf War, contrasting sharply with the reception of veterans from earlier conflicts like Vietnam. The parade served as a moment of pride and recognition for those who served, although it also highlighted the mixed feelings surrounding military engagements in U.S. history. In the aftermath of the parade, Bush's political fortunes waned due to economic challenges and rising competition for the presidency. The upcoming parade aims to evoke similar patriotic sentiments and honor military service in a contemporary context.
