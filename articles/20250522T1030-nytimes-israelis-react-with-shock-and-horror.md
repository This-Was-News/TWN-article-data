## Article summary
Israelis expressed shock and horror following the murder of two staffers at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned as an antisemitic act. The victims, identified as Sarah Lynn Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, were shot after attending an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. A suspect was arrested, reportedly shouting "Free, free Palestine" upon his capture. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar linked the attack to rising antisemitism fueled by accusations against Israel since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict in October 2023. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties on both sides, with over 1,200 Israelis and more than 53,000 Palestinians reportedly killed. Concerns about the safety of Israelis abroad have increased, prompting warnings against displaying Israeli symbols. Domestic political tensions have also escalated, with politicians blaming each other for the attack. Left-wing leader Yair Golan criticized Netanyahu's government for inciting hatred, while far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir accused leftists of encouraging violence through their rhetoric. Historical context highlights that Israeli diplomatic missions have long been targets for attacks. The situation underscores the ongoing risks faced by Jews globally amid escalating political and social tensions.
