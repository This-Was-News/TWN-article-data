## Article summary
The article "The Populist vs. the Billionaire: Bannon, Musk and the Battle Within MAGA" explores the growing tensions between Stephen Bannon and Elon Musk within Donald Trump's MAGA movement. Bannon, a staunch populist, criticizes Musk as an opportunist and has expressed concerns that Musk's influence may undermine the movement's core values. Despite Trump's attempts to mediate between the two, Bannon's vocal disdain for Musk continues to resonate with key MAGA supporters. The article highlights Bannon's longstanding commitment to populism and his skepticism of wealthy figures like Musk, who he believes lack ideological commitment to the cause.

Musk, who was initially a Trump critic, has become a significant benefactor and supporter, but he remains largely indifferent to the MAGA movement's future. Both figures have substantial followings within conservative circles, with Bannon known for his media presence and Musk for his influence on social media platforms. The article notes that while Musk has made efforts to align himself with the movement, Bannon sees fundamental ideological differences between them, particularly regarding immigration policies. The dynamics between Bannon and Musk underscore the conflicting interests within the MAGA movement, which continues to evolve under Trump's leadership.
