## Article summary
The Trump administration is making significant changes across various sectors, including media access, immigration policy, and federal housing programs. Recently, the White House altered press pool arrangements, limiting The Associated Press's access to White House events despite a judge's order to include them. President Trump extended a hiring freeze for federal employees and signed executive orders that opened marine sanctuaries to commercial fishing, reversing protections established by the previous administration. In foreign relations, Ukraine signed a memorandum with the U.S. for economic partnership, with discussions ongoing about a deal on rare earth minerals. Senator Lisa Murkowski expressed concerns about political retribution under Trump's leadership, highlighting the anxiety among public officials. Additionally, a federal appeals court criticized the Trump administration for its handling of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation to El Salvador, emphasizing the need for due process. Amid these developments, the administration is considering deep cuts to federal housing programs, including potential changes to Section 8 vouchers, which could severely impact low-income families. The proposed changes reflect a broader agenda to reduce government influence in citizens' lives. Overall, the administration's actions indicate a push toward deregulation and a tightening of immigration policies, amidst ongoing legal and political challenges.
