## Article summary
Chinese companies are increasingly relocating their manufacturing operations to Vietnam to avoid high tariffs imposed by President Trump, which have reached 145 percent. This shift has led to a surge in exports from China to Southeast Asia, as businesses scramble to find new trade routes. E-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein are facilitating this transition by helping Chinese factories identify alternative manufacturing partners in Vietnam. However, challenges remain, such as increased production costs in Vietnam and logistical hurdles related to sourcing materials. 

Some factories, like QIS Sport Goods and Dongguan Box, are already ramping up operations in Vietnam to meet American demand. Despite the advantages of cheaper labor, the cost of manufacturing certain products, such as gift boxes, can be higher in Vietnam due to shipping raw materials. Social media has also seen a rise in agents offering advice on circumventing trade rules, highlighting the desperation within the Chinese supply chain. 

While some companies have successfully made the move, others are hesitant due to logistical concerns. Nonetheless, the trend indicates a long-term shift as many Chinese businesses view Vietnam as both a temporary fix and a potential long-term solution for manufacturing.
