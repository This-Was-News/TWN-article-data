## Article summary
A former Jan. 6 defendant, Jared Wse, is now a senior advisor at the Department of Justice. Bodycam footage shows Wse berating police officers during the Capitol riot, calling them 'Nazis' and 'Gestapo,' and yelling 'kill 'em' as rioters attacked law enforcement. Wse, a former FBI agent, was not convicted of any crimes related to Jan. 6 due to President Trump's order to end all Capitol riot prosecutions. The Department of Justice defended Wse's hiring, stating he is a valued team member. Wse's trial, led by Greg Rosen, was dismissed after Trump took office and ordered the case dropped. Wse testified that his actions were driven by anger and a perceived response to police brutality. The Trump administration has pardoned over 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants and closed ongoing investigations into assaults on police. The administration has also appointed conservative activists, including Ed Martn, who has suggested that violence against police on Jan. 6 may have been justified due to conspiracy theories. The hiring of former Jan. 6 defendants and the administration's actions have been criticized as hypocritical, particularly given their portrayal as firm advocates of law enforcement.
