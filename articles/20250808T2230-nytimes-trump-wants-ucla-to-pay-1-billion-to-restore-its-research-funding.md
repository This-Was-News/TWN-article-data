## Article summary
The Trump administration is demanding over $1 billion from the University of California, Los Angeles (U.C.L.A.) to restore halted federal research funding. The proposed settlement includes a $1 billion payment to the U.S. government and a $172 million contribution to a claims fund for civil rights violations. This would be the largest payout by any university settling with the White House, surpassing agreements by Columbia and Brown universities. U.C.L.A.'s president, James B. Millken, criticized the demand, stating it would devastate the university and harm students. The administration has targeted elite private universities recently, but its focus on U.C.L.A. has intensified following a lawsuit settlement related to campus protests. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, vowed to fight the administration's demands, calling them wrong. U.C.L.A. has shown willingness to engage in dialogue with the federal government, but its president criticized the administration's actions. The proposed settlement also includes non-financial conditions, such as appointing a monitor and abolishing race-based scholarships. The administration is negotiating with other universities, including Harvard, which has sued over the government's actions. U.C.L.A. has not yet decided whether to take legal action. The administration's demands fit a broader pattern of targeting California, where Governor Newsom is a political foe of President Trump.
