## Article summary
The S&P 500 reached a record high, marking a significant recovery after fears of trade tariffs under President Trump had previously caused market turmoil. The index rebounded following Trump's decision to delay steep tariffs, resulting in a 23 percent rise since April 9. Despite ongoing challenges, such as inflation and geopolitical tensions, the market's rally has been supported by positive economic data and easing tensions in the Middle East. However, analysts caution that underlying concerns, including U.S. policy uncertainty and declining business profits, may emerge later in the year.

The rally has been largely driven by a few large technology companies, known as the "Magnificent 7," whose gains overshadow the more modest increases of other stocks in the index. While many investors remain cautious, some are positioning themselves for a potential market downturn. Trump's tariff decisions have been pivotal in the market's resurgence, with significant gains often occurring following announcements related to tariffs. Additionally, hopes for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could further influence stock prices. Despite the current positive momentum, analysts expect a reality check as corporate profit warnings may disrupt the market's upward trajectory.
