## Article summary
Canada and China have swiftly retaliated against the United States following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs, raising concerns about a potential global trade war. The new U.S. tariffs include a 25% levy on most imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy exports and an increase of Chinese tariffs from 10% to 20%. In response, China announced additional tariffs of 10-15% on various U.S. agricultural products, while Canada plans to impose immediate 25% tariffs on over $20 billion worth of U.S. imports, with more tariffs on an additional $86 billion set to follow in three weeks. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that these tariffs would remain until the U.S. revokes its trade actions.

Trump defended the tariffs as a necessary measure against Canada and Mexico, citing concerns over drug trafficking, while also suggesting that the tariffs would encourage businesses to relocate to the U.S. The announcement of the tariffs has already led to significant declines in international markets, with Asian stocks falling sharply. U.S. markets also experienced a downturn, with major indices closing lower ahead of the tariff deadline. Trump has indicated that there is no room for negotiation regarding the tariffs, asserting that they would take effect as planned.
