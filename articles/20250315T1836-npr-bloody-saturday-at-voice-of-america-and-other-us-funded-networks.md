## Article summary
The article titled "Bloody Saturday" at Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks discusses a significant upheaval at the Voice of America (VOA) and related organizations, where federal officials placed 1,300 employees on indefinite paid leave following an order from President Trump. This directive mandated the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to eliminate all non-essential activities, resulting in the termination of contracts with various international broadcasters, including Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The actions have been described as "Bloody Saturday" by former officials, who lament the potential loss of vital news services that reach millions in authoritarian regimes.

Critics argue that these cuts will empower adversaries of the U.S., such as the Iranian and Chinese governments, by diminishing access to independent journalism. The article highlights the longstanding bipartisan support for these networks, which serve as a form of soft diplomacy and provide crucial news coverage in regions with restricted press freedoms. The turmoil has raised concerns about the future of these broadcasters and their ability to fulfill their missions under increased political control.

The article also mentions that the networks have faced scrutiny for their editorial choices, particularly from Trump allies who have called for their shutdown. Despite these challenges, many officials continue to recognize the importance of USAGM networks in countering propaganda and providing accurate information globally.
