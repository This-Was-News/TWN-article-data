## Article summary
The leaders of Britain, France, and Germany are strengthening their defense and diplomatic ties in response to shifting U.S. policies under President Trump. Recent agreements include a mutual defense treaty between Britain and Germany, coordination of nuclear arsenals between Britain and France, and plans for a Europe-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine. These efforts aim to supplement, not replace, existing alliances like NATO, as Europe seeks a more nimble and independent approach to security. The leaders are also working to rebuild diplomatic and economic bridges damaged by Brexit and to address concerns over potential U.S. withdrawal from European security commitments. While they maintain close relationships with the Trump administration, they are preparing for a future where Europe takes greater responsibility for its own defense.
