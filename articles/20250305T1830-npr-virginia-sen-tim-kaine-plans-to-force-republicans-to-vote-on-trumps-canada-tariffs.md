## Article summary
Virginia Senator Tim Kaine plans to challenge President Trump's recently imposed tariffs on Canada, which he argues will raise prices for consumers and businesses. Kaine believes that many Republicans in Congress are anxious about the economic impact of these tariffs, which are set at 25% and affect key goods like cars and groceries. He intends to force a Senate vote on this issue by the end of March, asserting that the justification for the tariffs—stemming from a declared emergency related to fentanyl—lacks validity. Kaine highlights that most fentanyl entering the U.S. does not come from Canada, and he argues that the tariffs are a pretext for a trade war that could harm Virginia's economy. He previously led a failed vote against another emergency declaration by Trump regarding energy. Kaine's legislation aims to challenge the tariffs based on their questionable premise, and he expresses confidence that the upcoming vote will reveal Republican concerns about the tariffs' effects on their constituents. Overall, he emphasizes the need for bipartisan support to address the economic repercussions of these tariffs.
