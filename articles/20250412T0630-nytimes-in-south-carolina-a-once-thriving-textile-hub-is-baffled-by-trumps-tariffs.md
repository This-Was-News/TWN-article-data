## Article summary
In South Carolina, once a textile powerhouse, the region is grappling with the implications of President Trump's tariffs aimed at reviving American manufacturing. Former mill worker Adolphus Jones reflects on the industry's decline, noting that the textile jobs of the past offered little upward mobility and were often associated with poor working conditions. The local economy has shifted towards foreign investments, with companies like BMW and Michelin now driving growth in Spartanburg and Greenville. Despite Trump's push for tariffs, local leaders express concern that such measures could threaten these successful businesses and the jobs they provide. Governor Henry McMaster acknowledges the benefits of foreign companies while supporting the goal of American self-sufficiency. While some residents hope for a modern textile revival, experts suggest that the industry's evolution may not align with traditional manufacturing. The remnants of the former textile era are evident in abandoned mills, but towns like Union have begun attracting new industries. Overall, the community remains skeptical about returning to the past, with many preferring the current economic landscape over the bygone textile days.
