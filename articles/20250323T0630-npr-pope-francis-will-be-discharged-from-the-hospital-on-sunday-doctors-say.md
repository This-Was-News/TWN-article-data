## Article summary
Pope Francis is set to leave the hospital on Sunday following a five-week treatment for a life-threatening respiratory illness that developed into bilateral pneumonia. His medical team announced that the pope's condition has improved significantly, allowing him to return to the Vatican, where he will require two months of rest and ongoing care. The 88-year-old pontiff was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital on February 14 and faced two critical episodes during his hospitalization. He underwent two bronchoscopies to clear mucus from his lungs but did not need intubation. Despite the severity of his illness, he remained alert throughout his treatment. Surgeon Sergio Alfieri confirmed that the pneumonia has been successfully treated, but emphasized the importance of rest for complete recovery. In his first public appearance since being hospitalized, Francis will bless a crowd outside the hospital on Sunday. He has expressed gratitude to pilgrims for their prayers and support during his illness.
