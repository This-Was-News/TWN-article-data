## Article summary
The Trump administration plans to deport migrants without legal status to Libya, a country facing ongoing armed conflict, although Libyan officials have denied any discussions with the U.S. on this matter. This initiative follows reports indicating that Trump is considering other African nations, such as Benin, Angola, and Eswatini, for similar deportations. Immigration lawyers have filed an emergency motion to block these removals, citing concerns for their clients from Laos, Vietnam, and the Philippines, who could potentially be deported within hours. While deportations to Libya are expected to be executed by the U.S. military, specific flight details remain unconfirmed. President Trump referred inquiries about the plan to Homeland Security. Libya, divided between rival factions since a civil war in 2011, has a notorious reputation for mistreating migrants. The Trump administration has been actively seeking to deport migrants to third countries, with several Latin American nations already accepting deportees. Recent agreements with El Salvador and Colombia have been established to facilitate the sharing of biometric and criminal information for deportations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the administration's intent to send "despicable human beings" far from the U.S. to prevent their return.
