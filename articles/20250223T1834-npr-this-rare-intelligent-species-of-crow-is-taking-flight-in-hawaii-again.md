## Article summary
The endangered Hawaiian crow, known as the ʻalalā, is making a hopeful return to the wild after being extinct in its natural habitat since 2002. A small group of five young ʻalalā has been released in a hawk-free forest on Maui, following a successful breeding program that has increased their population to over 100 in captivity. The release is part of a larger conservation effort in Hawaii, which faces significant challenges due to habitat loss, disease, and invasive species that threaten native wildlife. 

Biologists and wildlife officials are closely monitoring the released crows, who are still adjusting to their new environment and require supplemental food as they learn to forage. The crows were given a traditional Hawaiian send-off, reflecting their cultural significance. Unlike previous attempts on the Big Island, this release aims to provide a safer environment for the birds, as they adapt to life outside captivity. 

The conservationists are hopeful that this initiative will prove successful, marking a significant step forward for wildlife recovery in Hawaii. The project highlights the ongoing struggle to preserve biodiversity in a region with a high number of endangered species.
