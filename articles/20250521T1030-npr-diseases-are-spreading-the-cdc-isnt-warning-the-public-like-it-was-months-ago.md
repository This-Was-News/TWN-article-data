## Article summary
The article discusses the significant decline in communication from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since the Trump administration took office, noting that many health alerts and newsletters have ceased. This reduction in communication is seen as dangerous given the ongoing health emergencies, including outbreaks of measles, salmonella, and chronic diseases affecting millions. Former CDC employees express concerns that the agency's ability to inform the public has been severely hampered, with many communications now requiring approval from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Critical publications, such as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, faced delays, raising alarms among public health professionals. The article highlights that the CDC's communication staff has been drastically reduced due to layoffs, further complicating their outreach efforts. As a result, essential health messages have been bottlenecked, leading to missed opportunities for timely public health warnings. The article also points out that social media channels, which were vital for disseminating information, have seen a notable decrease in activity, with some accounts posting infrequently or not at all. Critics argue that the current communication strategy prioritizes political messaging over essential public health information. The article concludes by emphasizing the potential risks of inadequate communication for public health safety.
