## Article summary
President Trump is asserting greater independence in selecting judges, distancing himself from the Federalist Society, which previously influenced his nominations. Following a court ruling against his tariffs, Trump criticized the society for providing poor advice on judicial picks, particularly targeting Leonard Leo, a key figure in the conservative legal movement. His recent appointments reflect a shift towards choosing loyalists who align closely with his agenda rather than traditional conservative candidates. This change may impact judges considering retirement, especially those on the Supreme Court, as Trump seeks to fill their seats with his preferred nominees. The Justice Department has also limited the American Bar Association’s role in vetting judicial nominees, prompting further tension with traditional conservatives. While some legal experts express concern over Trump's approach, others predict he will continue to appoint bold judges. Trump's recent picks, including Emil Bove III, indicate a preference for candidates who are politically aligned rather than strictly adhering to conservative legal principles. This shift raises questions about the future of judicial appointments under his leadership and the potential backlash from the conservative legal establishment. Ultimately, Trump's strategy could redefine the criteria for judicial nominations in his second term.
