## Article summary
The article discusses a simulation conducted by trade experts at the Center for a New American Security to explore the dynamics of a global trade war, particularly under President Trump's aggressive tariff policies. The simulation involved teams representing major economies, including the U.S., China, and Europe, negotiating to mitigate the economic fallout from escalating tariffs. Initially, the simulation indicated severe negative impacts, with many red cubes representing increased tensions, job losses, and inflation. However, as the day progressed, participants managed to reach concessions, leading to the removal of some tariffs and a refreshing of trade agreements. Experts noted that while the U.S. remains a dominant player in global trade negotiations, the success of a tariff-first strategy depends on the U.S. pursuing bilateral agreements. Some countries, like Canada, began to seek alternatives to U.S. markets, but most waited for U.S. engagement. Concerns were raised about the potential for souring public opinion and the feasibility of negotiating with multiple countries simultaneously. Overall, the simulation revealed both challenges and potential pathways for trade negotiations amid rising tensions.
