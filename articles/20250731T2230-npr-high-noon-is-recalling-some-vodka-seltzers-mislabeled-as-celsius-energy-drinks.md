## Article summary
High Noon is recalling certain 12-packs of its vodka seltzers due to mislabeled cans that contain the company's alcohol instead of Celsius energy drinks. The issue stems from a shared packaging supplier, leading to some cans being incorrectly labeled as Celsius's Sparkling Blue Razz energy drink. The recall affects beach variety packs sent to retailers in Florida, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin between July 21 and July 23. Celsius and High Noon are collaborating on an investigation, and no illnesses or adverse reactions have been reported. Consumers are advised to check lot numbers and lid colors on affected cans and contact High Noon for refunds if they have purchased the mislabeled products.
