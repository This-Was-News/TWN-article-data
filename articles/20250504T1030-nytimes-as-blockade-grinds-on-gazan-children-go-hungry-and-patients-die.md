## Article summary
Israel's total blockade of Gaza has led to catastrophic humanitarian conditions, with over 60 days of halted aid resulting in severe shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. The health ministry in Gaza reports that patients with treatable conditions are dying due to lack of medical supplies, while humanitarian groups accuse Israel of using aid as a political tool. The blockade has exacerbated the struggles of nearly two million residents, with 91% facing food insecurity, and many relying on charity kitchens for sustenance. Prices for basic food items have skyrocketed, making it nearly impossible for the impoverished population to afford necessities. Malnutrition is rampant, affecting the medical system and limiting treatment options for patients, particularly those requiring dialysis. Additionally, access to clean water has drastically decreased due to damaged infrastructure and electricity shortages. The U.N. and aid organizations warn that conditions may soon be classified as famine, while Israeli authorities claim that supplies are adequate and blame Hamas for hoarding. As the humanitarian crisis deepens, medical professionals express despair over the situation and the increasing likelihood of losing more patients without urgent intervention.
