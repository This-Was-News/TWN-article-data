## Article summary
Troops have been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border to assist with enforcement, despite a decline in migrant crossings. The U.S. Army states that these soldiers will not be arresting individuals suspected of illegal entry but will provide logistical support to Border Patrol agents. Local residents express concerns about the militarization of their community, noting that the area already has a significant law enforcement presence. The deployment includes approximately 500 active-duty soldiers in the Big Bend region, which has seen low border arrest numbers compared to other areas. Officials, including Judge Joe Portillo, welcome the military's presence, citing the need for additional support in monitoring the border. The Army's role will focus on detection and monitoring, enhancing the capabilities of Border Patrol. The deployment marks a shift in the government's border security strategy, featuring the use of Stryker vehicles for deterrence. Historical deployments have occurred in the past, with mixed community reactions. Overall, the military's involvement aims to bolster border security during a time of decreased migrant encounters.
