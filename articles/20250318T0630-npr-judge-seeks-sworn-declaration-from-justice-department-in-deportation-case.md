## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Justice Department to provide a sworn declaration regarding the deportation of alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which occurred despite the judge's prior order to halt the flights. The case arose after over 250 individuals were deported following President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The judge's emergency order was issued on a Saturday, but the Justice Department claimed it was too late to prevent the deportations, as planes were already in flight. 

During the hearing, the timing and nature of the judge's orders were debated, particularly whether an oral order issued before the written order had the same legal weight. Civil rights groups argued that the government may have violated the court's command, as some deportees remained in U.S. custody until their planes landed in El Salvador. The plaintiffs highlighted that at least two planes carrying deportees were still airborne when the written order was released, while a third took off afterward. 

The White House acknowledged uncertainties regarding the legal standing of verbal versus written orders and stated that their lawyers would address these questions in court. The situation has raised significant concerns about the government's compliance with judicial directives in deportation cases.
