## Article summary
U.S. and Chinese officials are set to meet in Geneva, signaling a potential easing of tensions in their ongoing trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will engage with Beijing's lead economic representative, He Lifeng. Bessent emphasized the unsustainability of current tariffs, equating them to an embargo, while expressing a desire for fair trade rather than economic decoupling. The trade war has resulted in significant tariffs on both sides, with Chinese goods facing tariffs of 145% in the U.S. and U.S. goods facing 125% in China. Analysts are hopeful for a resolution, as the trade war poses risks of a global recession. Political commentator Ming Jinwei urged the U.S. to adopt a more respectful approach towards China's economic position. Predictions suggest that a trade deal may be reached soon, likely involving the U.S. reducing tariffs but maintaining some duties on Chinese goods. China remains open to negotiations but insists on upholding its principles. Overall, the upcoming talks represent the first tangible sign of a possible thaw in relations between the two superpowers.
