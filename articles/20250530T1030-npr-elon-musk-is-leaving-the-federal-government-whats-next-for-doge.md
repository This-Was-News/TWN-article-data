## Article summary
Elon Musk is leaving his role in the federal government, specifically from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), after a tumultuous 130-day tenure marked by legal challenges and conflicts with Cabinet members. His departure comes amid criticisms of DOGE's claims about saving money and improving efficiency, which have been deemed overstated and inaccurate. Musk's initial ambitious goal of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget was significantly scaled back to a target of $150 billion. However, his efforts have faced setbacks, including lawsuits questioning DOGE's authority and the impact of his policies on government efficiency.

Despite Musk's public assertions that DOGE would continue to thrive, his exit allows him to refocus on his businesses, particularly Tesla, which has experienced financial difficulties during his government involvement. Musk has indicated a desire to reduce his political spending following significant contributions to Trump's re-election efforts. As he transitions back to his companies, he has also shifted his social media focus to promote Tesla and other ventures. Overall, while Musk's departure may signal a change in direction for DOGE, the future of its initiatives remains uncertain.
