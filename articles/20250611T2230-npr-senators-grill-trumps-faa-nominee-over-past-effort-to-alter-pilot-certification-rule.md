## Article summary
Bryan Bedford, President Trump's nominee to lead the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), faced intense questioning from the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee regarding his past efforts to modify the "1,500-hour rule" for pilot certification. This rule, implemented in 2013 following a deadly plane crash, mandates that pilots must log 1,500 flight hours before obtaining commercial certification. Bedford, CEO of Republic Airways, expressed his support for modernizing the air traffic control system but did not directly commit to upholding the 1,500-hour requirement when pressed by Senator Tammy Duckworth. Critics, including families of Colgan Air crash victims and pilot associations, voiced concerns about Bedford's nomination, fearing potential safety compromises. While Bedford argued that safety is not static, he did not provide a clear stance on future changes to the rule. His nomination comes at a time when the FAA is addressing significant safety concerns and staffing shortages. Bedford has received support from various aviation industry groups, despite opposition from some safety advocates. If confirmed, Bedford would have significant influence over pilot certification regulations. The hearing highlighted the tension between aviation safety and industry pressures related to pilot shortages.
