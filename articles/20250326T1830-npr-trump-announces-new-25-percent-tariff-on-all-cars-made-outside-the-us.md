## Article summary
President Trump has announced a new 25% tariff on all cars made outside the U.S., emphasizing his administration's focus on boosting American manufacturing. This decision continues his tariff-centric economic agenda, which has already included tariffs on goods from major trading partners like China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as on steel and aluminum imports. Trump expressed optimism that these tariffs would revitalize the U.S. automobile industry, stating, "I think our automobile business will flourish like it's never flourished before."

The tariffs are set to take effect on April 3, with Trump also planning to introduce "reciprocal tariffs" against countries that impose tariffs on U.S. goods. While the administration argues these measures will enhance manufacturing, they have led to increased uncertainty among businesses and consumers, contributing to stock market declines. Critics point out that U.S. businesses and consumers primarily bear the cost of these tariffs, despite assurances from officials that foreign companies would absorb some of the costs.

The chaotic nature of Trump's tariff policies has raised concerns, as he has frequently shifted his stance on various goods. As tensions with trading partners escalate, the broader implications of these tariffs on the economy remain to be seen.
