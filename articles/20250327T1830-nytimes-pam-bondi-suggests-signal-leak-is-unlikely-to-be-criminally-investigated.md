## Article summary
Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated that a criminal investigation into the sharing of military operation details in an unsecured Signal group chat is unlikely. During a news conference, she emphasized that the specifics shared, such as timing for fighter jet departures and bomb drops, were sensitive but not classified. This discussion arose following Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's disclosure of an upcoming military strike in Yemen to senior officials, which accidentally included a magazine editor. Bondi praised the successful military operation, redirecting focus away from the leak and critiquing Democrats for previous mishandling of classified information. 

She referenced past investigations into Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, but did not mention the abandoned prosecution of Donald Trump related to classified documents. While the FBI and Justice Department could investigate, they typically do not pursue cases involving unclassified information. National security experts criticized the argument that the shared information was not classified, highlighting the risks of leaking military plans. Democratic lawmakers expressed skepticism about the claims made by Trump administration officials regarding the classification of the information shared. Overall, Bondi's statements suggest a dismissal of the need for further inquiry into the incident.
