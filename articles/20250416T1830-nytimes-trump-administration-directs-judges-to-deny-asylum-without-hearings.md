## Article summary
The Trump administration has implemented a new policy directing immigration judges to swiftly deny asylum applications deemed unlikely to succeed, bypassing the normal hearing process. This guidance, effective from April 11, allows judges to dismiss cases without hearings, preventing asylum seekers from presenting their claims. The policy aims to manage the overwhelming backlog of nearly four million cases in immigration courts, as noted by Sirce Owen, acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. Critics argue it undermines due process and the complexities of asylum law, as judges are expected to exercise independent judgment in allowing applicants to present their cases. 

To qualify for asylum, applicants must demonstrate a credible fear of persecution based on specific criteria. The memo suggests merit hearings should only occur when factual disputes exist, potentially leading to deportations before full hearings. The backlog has worsened with increasing border crossings, and many asylum seekers lack legal representation, which complicates their ability to file comprehensive applications. Advocates warn that navigating the legal system without counsel can hinder applicants, impacting their chances of success significantly. The policy raises concerns about the fairness and thoroughness of the asylum process, which can have life-altering consequences for individuals seeking refuge.
