## Article summary
India launched strikes on Pakistan two weeks after a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed over two dozen civilians. The Indian government claimed to have targeted nine sites in Pakistan, including areas in Punjab, marking an escalation in their military actions. Pakistani officials confirmed that five locations were hit and warned of a measured response. The U.S. expressed concern over the escalating tensions, with President Trump calling it a shame. The nature of the strikes remains unclear, but reports suggest that civilian casualties occurred, which Pakistan has claimed. Indian forces named their operation Sindoor, reflecting the tragic nature of the earlier attack. The conflict over Kashmir has a long history, with both nations claiming the region while engaging in military confrontations. The situation has intensified since the April 22 attack, which India attributes to Pakistan-based militants, a claim Pakistan denies. The ongoing violence has led to significant military presence and operations in Kashmir, a region marked by historical disputes since the partition of India in 1947.
