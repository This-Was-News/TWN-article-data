## Article summary
President Trump has threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal over an article that claims he contributed a lewd birthday letter to a compilation given to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. The article alleges that a book of birthday letters from 2003, including one with Trump's signature and a naked woman outline, was part of an Epstein investigation. Trump called the story "false, malicious, and defamatory" and warned the Journal and Rupert Murdoch of legal action. He also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to release some files from Epstein's criminal case. The controversy follows a Justice Department and FBI review that found no evidence to support conspiracy theories about Epstein's life and death.
