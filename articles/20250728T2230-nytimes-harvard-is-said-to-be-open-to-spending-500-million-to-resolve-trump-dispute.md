## Article summary
Harvard University is reportedly open to spending up to $500 million to resolve a dispute with the Trump administration, which has accused the school of civil rights violations. The university is reluctant to directly pay the government but is discussing financial terms. Harvard is skeptical of Columbia University's agreement to allow an outside monitor, viewing it as a potential infringement on academic freedom. The Trump administration has shifted its strategy to focus on financial terms in settlements with universities. Harvard is weighing its options, considering both a legal battle and a settlement, while insisting on its independence from government oversight.
