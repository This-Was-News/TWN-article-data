## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of President Trump's proposed tariffs on automobiles imported to the United States, which would impose a 25 percent levy on foreign-made cars. This move is anticipated to significantly affect European automakers, particularly in Germany, the largest economy in Europe. The European Union is reportedly preparing to retaliate with its own tariffs on American goods, which could further escalate the trade tensions. The U.S. is the largest export market for European cars, accounting for nearly a quarter of all exports, with German manufacturers like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz being heavily reliant on this market.

The tariffs come at a time when the European auto industry is already struggling, having seen a decline in exports to the U.S. in 2024. Analysts warn that these tariffs could worsen the economic outlook for Europe, potentially leading to stagnation. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed regret over the U.S. decision and emphasized the need for a negotiated solution to safeguard economic interests. The article highlights concerns from industry leaders, including BMW's prediction of a $1 billion loss due to rising trade conflicts. The upcoming reciprocal tariffs from the U.S. are expected to be significant, potentially reaching double-digit percentages. Overall, the situation reflects a growing trade war that poses risks for both sides of the Atlantic.
