## Article summary
The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has escalated, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu citing both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missiles as existential threats. Since Friday, Iran has launched approximately 200 missiles at Israel, resulting in at least seven civilian deaths and over 200 injuries. The Israeli military's air defenses, although highly regarded, have struggled to intercept all incoming missiles, with 17 impact sites reported, including areas near Tel Aviv and Haifa. Iran's missile strikes appear to target civilian areas, and while the exact number of missiles remaining in Iran's arsenal is unclear, estimates suggest they could have up to 2,000 left. Each missile reportedly carries between 300 and 700 kilograms of explosives, with some capable of causing significant damage. Israel has been actively targeting Iranian missile stocks to reduce their capabilities. The recent barrage of missiles is notable for its volume and the targeting of densely populated areas, which has intensified the damage caused. Additionally, Iran has introduced a new missile type, the Shahed Haj Qassem, which boasts a range of nearly 1,000 miles and can be launched quickly from underground. This situation continues to evolve as both sides engage in military actions.
