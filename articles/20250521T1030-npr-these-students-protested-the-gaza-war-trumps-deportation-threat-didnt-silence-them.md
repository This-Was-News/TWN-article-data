## Article summary
The article discusses the experiences of international students at Columbia University who continue to protest against the Gaza war despite facing threats of deportation from the Trump administration. One student, identified as T, shares her fears after witnessing a classmate's arrest by immigration agents, prompting her to grapple with the risks of speaking out for Palestinian rights. T has actively documented protests to counter negative narratives about the movement, but the government's aggressive actions have made her feel paranoid and unsafe. She ultimately decided to return to her home country after graduation, seeking a safer environment to advocate for Palestinian rights. Another student, referred to as F, expresses her shock at the swift enforcement of deportation threats and acknowledges the emotional toll of ongoing violence in Gaza. Despite her initial belief that she was at low risk, F now takes precautions at protests to protect her identity. Both students reflect on the heavy burden of guilt and the urgency to continue their activism, even at the risk of losing their visas or facing detention. Their stories highlight the high stakes for international student activists in the current political climate.
