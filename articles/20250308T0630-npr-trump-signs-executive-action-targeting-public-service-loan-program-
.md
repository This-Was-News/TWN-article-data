## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed an executive action that alters the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which forgives federal student loans for borrowers working in public service after ten years of payments. The new directive specifies that individuals employed by organizations engaged in activities deemed to have a substantial illegal purpose will no longer qualify for forgiveness. This includes organizations involved in terrorism, child abuse, illegal discrimination, and violations of immigration and state laws. Critics argue that this move infringes on the free speech rights of borrowers and targets organizations opposing the administration's policies. 

The PSLF program, created in 2007, has faced challenges, including a high denial rate for forgiveness applications. Advocates believe that changing eligibility requirements through executive action may lead to legal challenges, as the president cannot redefine the law unilaterally. The Biden administration previously expanded PSLF rules, resulting in significant increases in loan forgiveness approvals. The recent executive action raises concerns about its impact on public service workers, particularly those serving vulnerable communities.
