## Article summary
A federal judge has approved a $2.7 billion settlement in the _House v. NCAA_ case, marking a significant shift in college sports by allowing NCAA Division I schools to directly pay athletes for the first time. Beginning this fall, each school can pay players up to a salary cap of $20.5 million, with over $2 billion allocated to compensate former college athletes who were prohibited from earning money while in school. This settlement arises from lawsuits advocating for the compensation of collegiate athletes, challenging the NCAA's long-standing amateurism rules. 

The settlement includes two components: retrospective payments to former athletes and a new framework for future compensation. Former athletes, particularly in football and basketball, will receive payments based on their participation before 2021, when NIL rights were first allowed. Going forward, schools will have the discretion to determine player payments, focusing on revenue-generating sports. 

The settlement also introduces roster limits, replacing traditional scholarship limits, and anticipates that approximately half of the NCAA's 365 Division I schools will adopt this new compensation model. Additionally, a third-party clearinghouse will be established to review NIL agreements for fair market value, although this aspect may face legal scrutiny. Overall, this settlement represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of college sports, moving towards financial equity for athletes.
