## Article summary
President Trump has removed Billy Long as the head of the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.) less than two months after his confirmation. Long, a former Republican congressman and Trump ally, is expected to be nominated for an ambassadorship. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting commissioner until a permanent replacement is found. Long and Bessent had occasional clashes, with Long feeling restricted by Bessent's oversight. Long prematurely announced a delay in the I.R.S.'s filing season, which the agency later corrected. The I.R.S. has experienced significant turnover under Trump, with over 25,000 staff members leaving. Previous acting commissioners have quit amid administration pressure to share taxpayer data. Long's tenure was marked by unusual choices, including promoting a fraudulent tax credit and supporting legislation to abolish the I.R.S. He traveled extensively to meet staff and placed two top officials on administrative leave. Long also allowed employees to leave early on Fridays, citing his upcoming birthday.
