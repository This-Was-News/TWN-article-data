## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, has made an extensive request for election data from Colorado, demanding "all records" related to the 2024 federal elections and any remaining records from the 2020 election. This unusual request has raised concerns among election officials, who suspect it may be tied to the prosecution of former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a Trump ally. Critics argue that the DOJ's demand appears to be a "fishing expedition" rather than a focused investigation, as it could encompass a vast amount of information, including voter registration materials and ballots. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold expressed worries that the data could be used to promote disinformation about election security.

The DOJ's request follows a broader trend of increased scrutiny of state voting practices, with similar demands made to other states. The request's vague nature and the involvement of Harmeet Dhillon, a former legal advisor to Trump, have raised ethical concerns about potential overlaps between private and government actions. Additionally, the letter contained errors, indicating a lack of careful oversight within the DOJ. As states respond to these requests, officials are apprehensive about the implications for election integrity and the potential for relitigating past election controversies.
