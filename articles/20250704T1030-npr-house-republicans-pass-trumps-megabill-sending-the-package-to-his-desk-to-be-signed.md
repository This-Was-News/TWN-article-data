## Article summary
House Republicans successfully passed President Trump's extensive tax and spending bill, sending it to his desk for signature after a narrow vote of 218 to 214. The legislation, which faced significant opposition from Democrats, represents a major shift in federal policy, reallocating funds from social programs to support tax cuts, immigration enforcement, and national defense. Trump actively campaigned for the bill, urging lawmakers to finalize it before the July 4 deadline, while also making promises to maintain Medicaid benefits, which the bill ultimately undermines. 

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a historic speech against the bill, highlighting its potential negative impact on vulnerable populations. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could increase the deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade and lead to nearly 12 million people losing health coverage. Republican leaders had to negotiate throughout the night to secure enough votes, addressing concerns from both conservative factions and those worried about changes to Medicaid. 

Despite the challenges, the bill's passage fulfills key campaign promises made by Trump, including making previous tax cuts permanent. House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated plans for additional reconciliation packages in the future to address unresolved issues. The pressure from Trump and the looming deadline played a significant role in the bill's final approval.
