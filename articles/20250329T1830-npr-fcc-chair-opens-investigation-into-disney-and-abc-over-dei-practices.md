## Article summary
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), led by Chair Brendan Carr, has initiated an investigation into Disney and its ABC network regarding their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. Carr expressed concerns that Disney may have engaged in discriminatory DEI practices, which could violate FCC regulations. The inquiry will assess both past and current policies, particularly following reports of Disney's leadership fully committing to controversial DEI approaches in recent years. 

This investigation arises after Disney recently scaled back its DEI initiatives, including changes to its content warnings on classic films and a shift in how it evaluates executive performance related to diversity. Carr highlighted the need for a thorough review of Disney's Reimagine Tomorrow initiative, which he claims serves to advance DEI efforts. He also referenced ABC's inclusion standards that mandate representation from underrepresented groups in its programming. 

In response, Disney stated it is reviewing the FCC's letter and is prepared to engage with the commission. The investigation reflects broader scrutiny of corporate DEI practices amid shifting political and regulatory landscapes.
