## Article summary
The Senate has passed a spending bill aimed at preventing a government shutdown, with a vote of 54 to 46 in favor. This short-term measure will fund the government through the end of September and includes a modest increase in defense spending alongside cuts to non-defense programs. The vote highlighted significant divisions within the Democratic party, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's support for the bill faced backlash from House Democrats, many of whom opposed it. Critics described the bill as a "blank check" for President Trump, allowing him to continue reducing previously approved spending without oversight.

Despite the dissent, Schumer argued that keeping the government operational was preferable to a shutdown, which would harm American citizens. Some Democratic senators expressed frustration with Schumer’s decision, suggesting it could impact his leadership in the future. The outcome reflects ongoing tensions between House and Senate Democrats regarding strategy and response to Trump's administration. Ultimately, while the immediate crisis of a shutdown was averted, the vote has left the party grappling with internal conflicts and differing approaches to governance.
