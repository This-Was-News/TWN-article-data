## Article summary
Russia and Ukraine are currently engaged in U.S.-mediated talks in Riyadh, focusing on a potential limited cease-fire amidst ongoing hostilities in the war. American envoys met with Russian officials after discussions with a Ukrainian delegation, aiming to halt attacks on energy infrastructure and ensure safety for shipping in the Black Sea. While both sides agreed last week to temporarily stop strikes on energy facilities, the specifics of implementing this partial truce remain undecided.

The talks involve technical discussions primarily among diplomats and advisers, with the U.S. delegation including key officials from the State Department and national security. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stipulated that any temporary truce requires Ukraine to cease military mobilization and foreign military aid. Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has set firm boundaries, refusing to accept Russian territorial claims or NATO restrictions.

Despite the potential for limited agreements on energy and shipping, significant challenges persist due to conflicting demands from both parties. Analysts express skepticism about the durability of any cease-fire, given the history of violations in prior truces. The diplomatic process appears fragile, with both Moscow and Kyiv prepared to continue military actions if necessary.
