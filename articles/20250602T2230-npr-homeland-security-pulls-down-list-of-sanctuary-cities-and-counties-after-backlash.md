## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) retracted a list identifying "sanctuary jurisdictions" just days after its release, following backlash from mayors and law enforcement. The list included numerous cities and counties that DHS claimed were not complying with federal immigration laws. Local leaders expressed confusion and frustration over their inclusion, asserting a lack of transparency in how the list was created. The National Sheriffs' Association criticized DHS for not providing clear criteria or a means to contest the designation. The list was part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to counter municipalities perceived as obstructing federal immigration enforcement. Sanctuary jurisdictions typically limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The DHS stated that the list would be regularly updated and based on various factors, including self-identification as a sanctuary and compliance with federal law. Local officials, including those from cities like Boise and San Diego, were surprised by their designation. President Trump had previously ordered the publication of such a list to highlight jurisdictions not adhering to federal immigration enforcement. The administration's actions have led to legal challenges from affected jurisdictions regarding funding and cooperation issues.
