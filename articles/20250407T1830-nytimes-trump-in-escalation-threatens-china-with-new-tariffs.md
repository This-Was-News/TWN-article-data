## Article summary
The article discusses the volatile impact of President Trump's tariffs on the stock market and global economy. Following a day of turbulent trading, the S&P 500 ended slightly down as Trump threatened to impose additional tariffs of 50% on China if it did not rescind its retaliatory tariffs. The situation has led to increased pessimism among investors, with the S&P 500 close to entering bear market territory, defined as a 20% decline from its peak. Various countries, including Bangladesh and Vietnam, have sought relief from the tariffs, while the European Union proposed to eliminate tariffs on American goods in exchange for similar concessions. Trump's administration has sent mixed signals about the willingness to negotiate, with some officials indicating readiness while others maintain a hardline stance. The tariffs are raising concerns over inflation and potential recession, with industry leaders warning of significant economic harm. The article highlights a false report about a potential pause in tariffs that briefly spiked market activity before being debunked. Overall, the article underscores the uncertainty and risks associated with Trump's aggressive trade policies and their global ramifications.
