## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's pattern of setting two-week deadlines for various policy decisions and actions, a tactic he has employed since his first term. Most recently, he announced he would decide on U.S. military involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict within two weeks, reflecting a longstanding trend of making similar promises regarding issues like tax legislation, healthcare, and geopolitical conflicts. Despite his repeated assurances, many of these deadlines have come and gone without substantial follow-through, leading to skepticism about their reliability. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted this tactic as one of Trump's favorites, often resulting in forgotten promises or hopes that the public would move on. Historical examples include delays in announcing a tax plan, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, and healthcare reforms, all of which extended well beyond the promised timelines. Trump's approach has also involved vague references to conspiracy theories and claims of evidence that never materialized. The article highlights that these two-week deadlines have become a notable aspect of Trump's communication style, often leaving questions unanswered and decisions unmade.
