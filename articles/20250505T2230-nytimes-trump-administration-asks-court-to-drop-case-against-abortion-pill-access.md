## Article summary
The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit aimed at restricting access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the Biden administration's stance in a case with significant implications for abortion access. This marks a notable position, as Trump and his administration have traditionally opposed abortion rights. The lawsuit, initiated by conservative attorneys general from Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, challenges regulatory changes made by the FDA since 2016 that expanded access to the medication. The Justice Department's filing argues that the case does not meet the legal standard for the federal district court where it was filed, asserting that the plaintiffs lack a connection to that jurisdiction. The lawsuit seeks to impose new restrictions on mifepristone, including banning it for individuals under 18 and targeting telemedicine prescriptions. Previously, a similar case was dismissed by the Supreme Court due to the plaintiffs' lack of standing. The current case was revived with an amended complaint filed in Texas. Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee known for his opposition to abortion access, is presiding over the case. Mifepristone is used in nearly two-thirds of abortions in the U.S., and telemedicine providers have become increasingly important, especially in states with abortion bans. As of now, 19 states have enacted stricter abortion restrictions than those established by Roe v. Wade.
