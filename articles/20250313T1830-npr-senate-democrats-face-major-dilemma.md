## Article summary
Senate Democrats are facing a critical decision as the government funding deadline approaches, leaving them to choose between supporting a Republican-backed funding bill or risking a government shutdown. The House-passed spending bill has been described by many Democrats as a blank check for President Trump, prompting internal debate within the party. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has criticized Democrats for their indecision, urging them to either support the bill or accept the consequences of a shutdown. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has emphasized that the funding process should be bipartisan, pointing out that the GOP's approach lacked Democratic input.

Some Democrats express concern about the ramifications of a shutdown, while others are adamant about opposing the bill due to its lack of negotiation. Only one Senate Democrat, John Fetterman, has publicly stated his support for the GOP plan, citing a desire to avoid chaos. Schumer has proposed a temporary four-week funding measure as an alternative to the longer-term bill. However, several key Democrats have already indicated they will vote against the GOP-backed measure, reflecting a split in the party's strategy. This "pick-your-poison" situation leaves Democrats grappling with the political implications of their choice as they navigate the complexities of government funding and party unity.
