## Article summary
Japan's major automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, anticipate minimal financial relief from the recent U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement aims to reduce U.S. tariffs on imported cars and parts to 15%, down from 27.5%, but this rate remains six times higher than earlier this year. Despite the reduction, the new tariff rates have not yet been implemented, causing confusion about their timeline. The automakers forecast minimal benefits to their profits, casting a gloomy outlook on their earnings. The automotive industry is crucial to Japan's economy, being its largest export to the U.S. and a significant employer. The trade deal's impact on profits is seen as limited, with the lower tariffs still posing challenges. The uncertainty and delayed implementation further dampen expectations. Overall, the trade deal is not expected to provide substantial financial relief to Japan's auto giants.
