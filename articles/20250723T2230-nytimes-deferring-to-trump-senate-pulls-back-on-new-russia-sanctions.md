## Article summary
The Senate has paused a bipartisan effort to impose new sanctions on Russia due to President Trump's threat to penalize Russia if it does not reach a cease-fire with Ukraine. The legislation, backed by 85 senators, aimed to impose severe sanctions on countries doing business with Moscow. Republican leaders have deferred to Trump's potential unilateral action, despite the Senate's consensus on the issue. Trump has threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Russia and its trading partners if Putin does not agree to a cease-fire within 50 days. Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed support for Trump's approach, indicating that the Senate will proceed with the legislation once Trump approves.
