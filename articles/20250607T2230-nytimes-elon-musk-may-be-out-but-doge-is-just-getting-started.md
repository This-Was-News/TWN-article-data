## Article summary
Elon Musk's initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), faces uncertainty following a fallout with President Trump, but its cost-cutting measures have become entrenched within the federal government. Key DOGE personnel have been integrated into various agencies, such as the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, where they continue efforts to streamline operations and cut spending. Despite Musk's sidelining, DOGE secured legal victories, allowing access to sensitive data and protecting its internal records from disclosure. The group initially aimed to slash the federal budget by $2 trillion but has since revised its target to $150 billion, although its claimed savings have been criticized for inaccuracies. The influence of DOGE may wane if the White House retaliates against its members in light of Musk's recent controversies. Concerns are growing among DOGE staff about job security, with some planning to leave government roles after Musk's departure. Legal challenges to DOGE's actions continue, questioning its authority and potential overreach within federal agencies. Meanwhile, the organization remains focused on eliminating waste and enhancing efficiency across government operations. Despite the challenges, some members, like Joe Gebbia, plan to stay and advance projects aimed at modernizing government processes. Overall, while DOGE's future is uncertain, its impact on federal efficiency initiatives appears to persist.
