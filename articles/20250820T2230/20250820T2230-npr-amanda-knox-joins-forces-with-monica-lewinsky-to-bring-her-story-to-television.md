## Article summary
Amanda Knox, wrongfully convicted of murder in 2007 and later exonerated, has teamed up with Monica Lewinsky to produce a Hulu series dramatizing her story. The eight-part series, 'The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox,' explores the events surrounding the murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, and its impact on Knox, her family, and others involved. Knox, who was demonized by the media, aims to reclaim her narrative and connect with viewers. She co-wrote the final episode and hopes the series will help people understand her experience. Lewinsky, who faced public scrutiny in the 1990s, worked as an executive producer and provided support to Knox. Both women share experiences of being vilified and sexually shamed. The series is based on extensive research, including court documents and police reports. Knox now advocates for the innocent and hosts true crime podcasts, while also pursuing stand-up comedy and music. She encourages others to find momentum in their traumatic experiences.
