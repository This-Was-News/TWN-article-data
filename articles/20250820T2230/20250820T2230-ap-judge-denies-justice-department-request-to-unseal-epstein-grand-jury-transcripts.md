## Article summary
A federal judge rejected the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking case, joining two other judges who declined similar requests. Judge Richard Berman, who presided over the 2019 case, ruled against releasing the transcripts, which contained mostly hearsay and lacked significant new information. The judges cited longstanding grand jury secrecy rules and noted that the Justice Department has extensive records on Epstein not covered by these rules. President Trump had called for the release of the transcripts amid criticism over his past involvement with Epstein. The Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling. Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted of sex trafficking charges, is serving a 20-year prison sentence and was recently transferred to a prison camp in Texas. The case has drawn heightened public focus, particularly after the Justice Department decided not to release additional documents from the Epstein investigation. Maxwell's lawyers indicated she would be open to an interview with the House Oversight Committee, but only if granted immunity from prosecution.
