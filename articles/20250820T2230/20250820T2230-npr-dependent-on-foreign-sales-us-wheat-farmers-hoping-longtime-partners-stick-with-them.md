## Article summary
U.S. wheat farmers, heavily reliant on foreign sales, are anxious about the impact of tariffs and potential retaliatory measures from key trading partners in Southeast Asia. Washington state, the nation's top wheat exporter, hosted a trade delegation from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, highlighting the importance of long-standing trade relationships. Farmers and trade groups are working to reassure these buyers despite political uncertainties and volatility. The Trump administration's tariffs have raised concerns about higher costs and the possibility of trading partners seeking alternatives. Farmers like Jim Moyer emphasize the need for certainty and worry about the patience of long-time trading partners. The region's extensive infrastructure, including barge systems and USDA labs, supports wheat exports, but the trade war and pandemic-related issues have increased equipment and fertilizer prices. Despite reassurances, farmers are feeling the strain of ongoing uncertainty and economic challenges. The recent trade delegation visit provided some reassurance, but the long-term impact of trade policies remains a significant concern for the agricultural community.
