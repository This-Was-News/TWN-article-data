## Article summary
Hurricane Erin is causing significant impacts along the East Coast, particularly in North Carolina's Outer Banks. The storm has already led to flooding on Highway 12, and mandatory evacuations are in effect for Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands. The National Hurricane Center describes Erin as a large and dangerous hurricane, with storm surge warnings and tropical storm warnings in place. Coastal flooding and overwash have begun, and the storm's effects are expected to peak Wednesday night into Thursday, with some areas feeling impacts through Friday. Officials warn residents to shelter in place and move to higher ground if water surrounds their homes. North Carolina Governor Josh Stein has declared a state of emergency. The storm's large size means its effects could be felt far from its center, with dangerous rip currents predicted along the East Coast, Atlantic Canada, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. Forecasters note that while hurricane frequency hasn't increased, the severity of storms has worsened due to warmer ocean temperatures fueled by climate change. North Carolina has recently experienced devastating storms, including Hurricane Helene, which caused significant fatalities and property damage.
