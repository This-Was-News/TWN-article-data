## Article summary
Israel has approved the E1 settlement project in the West Bank, which is seen as a significant obstacle to the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state. The project, delayed for over two decades, involves building around 3,400 additional housing units in a strategically sensitive area east of Jerusalem. Human rights groups and European countries argue that this development would further fragment the West Bank and make a Palestinian state less feasible. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies, has been advancing settlement construction amid international focus on the war in Gaza. The approval of E1 has drawn criticism from the international community, including traditional allies of Israel, who view it as a breach of international law and a threat to the two-state solution. The Israeli government has been accelerating settlement construction, including retroactively approving illegal outposts and facing backlash from Palestinian communities. The E1 project was revived this summer after years of dormancy due to international opposition, with the U.S. ambassador to Israel stating that the decision is up to the Israeli government. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has been a key figure in pushing for settlement expansion, framing it as a step toward eliminating the prospect of a Palestinian state.
