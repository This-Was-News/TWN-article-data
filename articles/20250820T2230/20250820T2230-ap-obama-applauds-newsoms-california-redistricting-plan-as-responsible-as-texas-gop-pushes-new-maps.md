## Article summary
Former President Barack Obama has praised California Governor Gavin Newsom's approach to redistricting, calling it 'responsible' during a fundraiser. Obama expressed that while he prefers not to engage in political gerrymandering, Democrats must respond effectively to Republican efforts, which he believes threaten inclusive democracy. The event raised $2 million for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. Meanwhile, Texas lawmakers are debating a new congressional map aimed at securing more Republican seats, prompted by President Donald Trump. Democratic governors, including Newsom, are considering redistricting strategies to strengthen their party's position. In California, a proposed map could give Democrats an additional five U.S. House seats, potentially reducing Republican representation. A hearing on this measure turned contentious, with a committee advancing the new map along party lines. Newsom and Democratic leaders plan to seek voter approval for the temporary maps, with the intention of returning map-drawing power to an independent commission after the 2030 census if Republican states do not proceed with new maps. Obama supported this temporary approach, deeming it a smart and measured response to current political challenges.
