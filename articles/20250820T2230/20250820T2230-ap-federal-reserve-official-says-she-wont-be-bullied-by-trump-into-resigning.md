## Article summary
Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has refused to resign after President Trump called for her removal following allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook stated she won't be bullied into stepping down due to questions raised on social media. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee, accused Cook of claiming two primary residences to secure better mortgage terms. Trump has been exerting pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, which Powell has resisted. If Cook is forced to leave, Trump could appoint a loyalist, increasing his influence over the Fed. Cook is gathering accurate information to address the allegations. Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, have expressed support for Cook and criticized Trump's actions. Trump's ability to replace Fed governors could shift the board's dynamics, as he aims to control the independent agency. The Fed's interest rate decisions are crucial, with Trump advocating for cuts to reduce government borrowing costs and boost the housing market. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve.
