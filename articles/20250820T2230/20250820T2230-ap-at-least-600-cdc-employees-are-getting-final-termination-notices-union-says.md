## Article summary
At least 600 employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are receiving permanent termination notices following a court decision that protected some employees but not others. The notices were sent this week, with many employees yet to receive them, according to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not provide details on the layoffs, referring to a previous statement about restructuring to improve efficiency. The cuts include about 100 people from the violence prevention division, occurring shortly after a shooting on the CDC campus. Employees expressed concern that experts trained to understand and prevent violence were among those laid off. On April 1, HHS sent layoff notices to thousands of employees as part of a major overhaul to shrink federal health agencies. A federal judge in Rhode Island issued a preliminary ruling protecting some CDC employees but not others, leading to finalized layoffs in other parts of the agency. Affected projects included efforts to prevent rape, child abuse, and teen dating violence, as well as international violence reduction initiatives. Retired senior director Tom Simon highlighted the irreplaceable loss of nationally and internationally recognized experts.
