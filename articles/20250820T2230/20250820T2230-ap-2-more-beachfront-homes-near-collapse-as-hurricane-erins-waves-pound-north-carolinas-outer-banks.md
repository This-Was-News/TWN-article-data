## Article summary
Two beachfront homes in Rodanthe, North Carolina, are on the brink of collapse due to the relentless waves from Hurricane Erin. Since 2020, 11 neighboring homes have already fallen into the Atlantic Ocean. The primary threats to these structures are beach erosion and climate change, which are gradually pushing the ocean closer to the homes' front doors. The village of Rodanthe, with about 200 residents, is particularly vulnerable as it juts further into the Atlantic than any other part of North Carolina. Jan Richards observed the deteriorating condition of the homes as high tides surged into their support beams. The ocean has claimed at least 11 houses in the past five years, according to the National Park Service. Experts note that barrier islands like the Outer Banks were never ideal for development, as they are dynamic and constantly shifting. Decades ago, buildings were smaller and easier to relocate as the shoreline changed. Even the iconic Cape Hatteras Lighthouse had to be moved inland due to erosion. The ocean erodes the sandy foundations of the homes, making them increasingly unstable. Collapsing homes can spread debris and pose environmental hazards. Potential solutions, such as beach nourishment or property buyouts, are expensive and financially challenging for small communities like Rodanthe. The issue of coastal erosion is not limited to North Carolina but is a national concern, exacerbated by rising sea levels.
