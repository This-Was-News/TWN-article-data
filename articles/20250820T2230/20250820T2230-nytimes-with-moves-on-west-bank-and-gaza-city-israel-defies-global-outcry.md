## Article summary
Israel has approved new settlements in the occupied West Bank and is advancing plans to take over Gaza City, defying international criticism and raising questions about the viability of a cease-fire proposal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions suggest he is catering to extremists in his coalition to maintain power, despite potential international isolation. The Israeli military is preparing to encircle and then assault Gaza City to prevent Hamas from regrouping, while also expanding humanitarian aid in southern Gaza. Meanwhile, the government has approved a large settlement project in the West Bank, further complicating prospects for a Palestinian state. International leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have condemned Israel's actions, with some countries planning to recognize Palestinian statehood. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties and destruction, with over 60,000 Palestinians killed and Gaza on the brink of famine. Netanyahu appears to believe he can rely on U.S. support despite widespread condemnation from Arab and European nations. The cease-fire proposal, accepted by Hamas, is uncertain as hardliners in Netanyahu's government threaten to collapse the coalition if it is pursued.
