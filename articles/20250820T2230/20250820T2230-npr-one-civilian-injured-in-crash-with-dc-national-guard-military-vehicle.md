## Article summary
A National Guard military vehicle crashed into a car in Washington, D.C., injuring the driver. The incident involved a Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle (MATV) weighing up to 16 tons, which collided with a civilian vehicle near Capitol Hill. The MATV was part of a five-vehicle convoy that stopped to assist the injured driver, who was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The deployment of the D.C. National Guard is part of President Trump's D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force, following his declaration of a 'crime emergency' in the capital. Troops from several states have been ordered to D.C. to support this initiative. Federal authorities have made 550 arrests and seized 76 firearms since August 7. The Metropolitan Police Department did not release a report on the crash as there was no criminal offense involved. Local resident Samuel Pastore criticized the presence of military vehicles in the neighborhood, expressing concern for the safety of children returning to school.
