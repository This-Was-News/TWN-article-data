## Article summary
President Trump has called for the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following allegations that she made false statements on mortgage applications. The allegations were raised by Trump ally Bill Pulte, who oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and involve Cook seeking mortgages on two properties within two weeks, each listed as her primary residence, with the Georgia condo later listed as a rental. Pulte has also raised similar claims against other Trump antagonists. Trump has been pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and has criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the central bank's headquarters renovation costs. Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, voted to hold interest rates steady last month. The Fed has been on hold since December, with inflation remaining above the target of 2%. Investors expect a rate cut in September, and Trump has nominated White House economic adviser Stephen Moore to fill a recent vacancy on the Fed's board. If Cook were to resign, it would create another opportunity for Trump to appoint a like-minded governor to the Fed's seven-member board, as her term expires in January 2038.
