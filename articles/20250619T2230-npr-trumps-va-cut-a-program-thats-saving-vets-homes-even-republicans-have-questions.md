## Article summary
The Veterans Affairs (VA) agency recently ended the VA Servicing Purchase program (VASP), which had been instrumental in helping over 33,000 veterans avoid foreclosure by offering low-interest mortgages. This abrupt cancellation has left many veterans, including those like Jon Henry and Matthew Kelly, facing dire financial situations and potential loss of their homes. The decision has drawn criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who are concerned about the lack of support for the approximately 80,000 veterans currently behind on their mortgages. VA Secretary Doug Collins defended the move, citing fears of significant costs to taxpayers and expressing hope for a new "partial claim" program to replace VASP.

However, critics argue that ending VASP without an immediate alternative leaves veterans vulnerable. Current mortgage rates make loan modifications unaffordable for many, forcing veterans to consider selling their homes or facing foreclosure. The VA's previous partial claim option was also shut down in late 2022, compounding the issue. As Congress works on a replacement, the timeline remains uncertain, raising fears that many veterans may lose their homes before any new safety net is established. Overall, the situation reflects a significant gap in support for veterans, undermining the VA's mission to protect and care for them.
