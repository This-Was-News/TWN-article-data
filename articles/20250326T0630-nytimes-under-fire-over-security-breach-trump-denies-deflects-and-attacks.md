## Article summary
President Trump downplayed a significant security breach involving a group chat where classified military plans were discussed, insisting that no classified information was shared. During a White House meeting, he defended his national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who mistakenly included journalist Jeffrey Goldberg in the chat. Trump claimed the incident was exaggerated, stating, "They've made a big deal out of this because we've had two perfect months." Critics, including former national security officials, expressed skepticism about the claim that the information was unclassified, given its sensitive nature. 

The chat included discussions about military strikes in Yemen, and while Trump and his allies criticized Goldberg, the accuracy of his report was acknowledged by intelligence officials during a Senate hearing. Democrats condemned the behavior of intelligence officials as "sloppy" and called for resignations. The use of the Signal app for such discussions raised concerns, as it is not approved for classified communications. The White House defended the use of Signal, attributing the fault to the technology rather than to Waltz. Despite the controversy, Trump appeared reluctant to make staff changes, aiming to maintain the narrative of a successful administration.
