## Article summary
Financial markets experienced turbulence on Monday, with U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar initially declining before recovering slightly by the afternoon. The S&P 500 ended the day 0.1 percent higher, while U.S. Treasury yields fluctuated, with the 10-year yield dropping to just under 4.5 percent. Concerns over a congressional bill aimed at making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent have raised fears of increased federal debt, contributing to market anxiety. Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating has further unsettled investors, as it reflects broader worries about fiscal deficits and debt costs. This downgrade also affected the ratings of major U.S. banks, indicating weakened government support for these institutions. Investors responded by pushing gold prices up by about 0.9 percent, seeking refuge amid market stress. Analysts from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have raised their forecasts for U.S. yields, anticipating that economic growth and persistent inflation will delay interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Raphael Bostic from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta noted the downgrade's potential implications for capital costs. Additionally, the dollar weakened against major currencies, signaling a possible shift in investor sentiment toward U.S. assets. The market remains on edge, reflecting concerns about the sustainability of U.S. economic policies and their impact on financial stability.
