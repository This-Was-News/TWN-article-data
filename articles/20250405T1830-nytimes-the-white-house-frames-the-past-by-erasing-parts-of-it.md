## Article summary
The article discusses the actions taken by the Trump administration to erase and modify significant content from government websites, impacting the public record and historical memory. Following the transition to the new administration, pages related to the Constitution, past presidents, and various social issues were removed or altered, raising concerns about transparency and the preservation of democracy. Experts criticized this selective deletion as an effort to reconstruct history according to Trump's narrative, likening it to authoritarian tactics seen in other countries. The head of the National Archives was dismissed, and funding for public records was threatened, leading to fears of a historical vacuum that could undermine accountability. Despite claims of increased transparency, many significant records and references, particularly regarding marginalized groups, were lost. Initiatives to preserve endangered information, such as the Internet Archive and other projects, have emerged in response to these deletions. The article highlights the unprecedented scale of this erasure and the potential long-term consequences for access to information and trust in facts. As researchers face growing limitations, the article emphasizes the importance of preserving public records and the dangers of censorship by omission.
