## Article summary
House Republicans have proposed charging migrants $1,000 to claim asylum as part of a broader effort to implement President Trump's domestic agenda and curb immigration. This legislation, introduced by the House Judiciary Committee, includes new fees aimed at immigrants seeking legal entry into the U.S. For the first time, asylum seekers would face an application fee, alongside a $100 annual fee while their claims are pending. Additionally, a $1,000 fee would apply to most immigrants paroled into the country, and sponsors of unaccompanied minors would need to pay $3,500, potentially complicating the release of these children into family care.

Asylum seekers and those under temporary protected status would also incur a $550 fee for work authorization. These fees are designed to deter illegal border crossings, which are currently at their lowest levels in years. Despite a general budget focus on cutting taxes and spending, the proposal allocates significant funding for immigration enforcement, including $45 billion for detention centers and $8 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement staffing. The House Judiciary Committee is set to review the proposal this week, amid expectations of political pushback from Democrats concerning cuts to popular federal programs like Medicaid.
