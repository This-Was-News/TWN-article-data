## Article summary
Brown University has reached a deal with the White House to restore federal research funding, following pressure from the Trump administration. The agreement requires Brown to spend $50 million on state workforce development programs and comply with the administration's policies on issues like transgender athletes and merit-based admissions. In exchange, the government will restore millions in blocked research funds and will not dictate Brown's curriculum or academic speech. The deal comes amid accusations of antisemitism at Brown due to pro-Palestinian protests and follows similar agreements with the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University. While the agreement has been criticized as capitulation, Brown's president, Christina H. Paxson, defended it as preserving academic integrity and allowing the university to move forward after a period of uncertainty.
