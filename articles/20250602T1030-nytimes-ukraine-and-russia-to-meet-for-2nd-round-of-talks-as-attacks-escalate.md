## Article summary
Ukraine and Russia are set to meet in Istanbul for a second round of peace talks amid escalating battlefield tensions. Following intense air attacks, both sides are expected to exchange their conditions for a potential deal, although expectations for progress are low. President Trump has been pressuring both nations to negotiate, but neither side appears willing to present acceptable terms. Recent military actions include a new Russian offensive and significant Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian air bases. The talks, complicated by political theatrics, aim to address a cease-fire before broader peace negotiations. Ukraine seeks an immediate cease-fire monitored by international partners, while Russia demands a resolution to the war's root causes, including NATO expansion and recognition of territorial gains. The composition of the delegations suggests the discussions may remain technical, with limited political influence. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov leads the Ukrainian delegation, while Vladimir Medinsky represents Russia. The outcome of these talks remains uncertain, with both sides previously accusing each other of provocations.
