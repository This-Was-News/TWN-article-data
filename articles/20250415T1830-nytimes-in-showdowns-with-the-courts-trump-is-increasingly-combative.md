## Article summary
The Trump administration has increasingly adopted a combative stance towards court orders, escalating from delays and semantic arguments to outright defiance. A key example is the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant deported despite a court ruling prohibiting his removal. The administration has ignored requests for information from Judge Paula Xinis, who mandated Garcia's return, and has stalled on compliance with various court orders. Legal experts express concern over the government's apparent bad faith and misinterpretations of judicial rulings, indicating a troubling trend in executive conduct. The administration has also faced scrutiny for its treatment of the press, particularly in barring The Associated Press from its press pool despite a court ruling against such actions. Overall, there is growing alarm among legal scholars regarding the administration's disregard for judicial authority, raising questions about the balance of power and compliance with the law. As the situation develops, further legal challenges are anticipated, potentially leading to renewed Supreme Court involvement. The ongoing defiance suggests a significant shift in the relationship between the executive branch and the judiciary.
