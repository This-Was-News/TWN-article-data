## Article summary
Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand military action in Gaza, including taking control of Gaza City, despite opposition from the military. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu aims to ensure Israel's security, drive Hamas from power, and facilitate the return of hostages. The plan outlines five principles, including disarming Hamas, establishing Israeli security control, and setting up an alternative civilian administration. Currently, Israel controls about 75% of Gaza, with the remaining areas densely populated by Palestinians facing dire humanitarian conditions. The military will prepare to take Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to civilians outside fighting zones. The operation could take days or weeks to mobilize and may involve the forced evacuation of tens of thousands of Palestinians. Netanyahu stated Israel does not want permanent authority over Gaza and intends to hand it over to Arab forces. Hamas has vowed resistance to any Israeli takeover. The Israeli military's chief of staff and the U.N. have expressed concerns about the plan's potential risks to hostages and civilians. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is severe, with many displaced and over 60,000 killed since the war began.
