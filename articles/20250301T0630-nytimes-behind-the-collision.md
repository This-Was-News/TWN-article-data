## Article summary
The article "Behind the Collision: Trump Jettisons Ukraine on His Way to a Larger Goal" discusses President Trump's recent shift in foreign policy regarding Ukraine, emphasizing his preference for raw power negotiations over traditional alliances. During a tense Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump criticized Ukraine's ability to deal with Russia and indicated a willingness to sacrifice Ukraine for a normalization of relations with Russia. This marked a significant departure from the U.S.'s previous support of Ukraine, with Trump and his administration signaling a diminished commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed this sentiment, advocating for a triangular relationship between the U.S., Russia, and China, while downplaying Russia's aggressive actions. The article highlights how Trump's approach seeks to dismantle the post-World War II international order, which he perceives as detrimental to American interests. Despite previously supporting Ukraine, Trump now views it as an obstacle to his broader geopolitical ambitions.

Zelensky's visit, intended to secure support, ended in disappointment as he faced open derision from Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The fallout from this meeting suggests a potential long-lasting impact on U.S.-Ukraine relations, with European allies expressing concern over the irreparable damage done. The article concludes by noting that while Trump aims to reshape global diplomacy, the feasibility of his vision remains uncertain, particularly in dealing with authoritarian regimes.
