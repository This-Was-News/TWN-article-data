## Article summary
President Trump recently addressed concerns regarding his administration's tariffs on Mexico and Canada, stating that they "could go up" and dismissing fears of economic uncertainty. In an interview with Fox News, he explained that the economy is currently in a "period of transition," and he refrained from predicting a recession during his term. Despite a recent rollback of some tariffs, Trump emphasized the importance of bringing wealth back to America and expressed confidence in the short-term relief provided to carmakers. Critics, including the head of the United Auto Workers, acknowledged that while tariffs are not a complete solution, they are crucial for addressing economic challenges. The stock market experienced a significant decline, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropping over 3% amid tariff-related uncertainties. Trump reiterated plans to implement "reciprocal" tariffs against all trading partners that impose tariffs on U.S. goods starting April 2nd. He expressed optimism that clarity would eventually return to businesses regarding tariffs. Overall, Trump remains steadfast in his economic policies despite criticism and market fluctuations.
