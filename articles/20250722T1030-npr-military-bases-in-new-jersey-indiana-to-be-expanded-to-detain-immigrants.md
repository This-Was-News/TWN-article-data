## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to use military bases in Indiana and New Jersey, as well as expand detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to detain immigrants who entered the country illegally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the use of these bases, requested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), through September 30, 2025. ICE will be responsible for the care and handling of migrants at these sites, with DHS paying for associated costs. The expansion comes as the Trump administration seeks to detain more immigrants, with DHS currently holding nearly 57,000 people in immigration detention. The plan includes space for up to 1,000 people at the Indiana and New Jersey bases and doubling the capacity at Guantanamo Bay to 400 people.
