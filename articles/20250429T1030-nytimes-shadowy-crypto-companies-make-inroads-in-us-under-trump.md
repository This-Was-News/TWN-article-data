## Article summary
The article discusses the growing presence of foreign cryptocurrency companies, particularly Tether, in the U.S. under President Trump's administration. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, recently attended a private lunch with U.S. lawmakers, signaling a shift in the regulatory landscape as crypto firms gain access to Congress. Tether, known for its stablecoin that maintains a $1 value, is pushing for favorable regulations, including influencing a Senate bill on stablecoins introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty. Despite past controversies regarding its financial practices, Tether has established significant connections in Washington, including ties to Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick. Ardoino portrays himself as an enthusiastic newcomer to U.S. politics while highlighting Tether's cooperation with law enforcement. The company has seen substantial profits and is considering launching a U.S. operation. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins, includes provisions that could benefit foreign issuers like Tether. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have raised concerns about loopholes in the legislation that may favor Tether. Overall, Tether's increasing influence reflects a broader acceptance of cryptocurrency in the U.S. market.
