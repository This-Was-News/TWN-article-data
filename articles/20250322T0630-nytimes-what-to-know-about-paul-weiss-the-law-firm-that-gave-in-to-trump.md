## Article summary
Paul Weiss, formally known as Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, is a prominent New York law firm with a history of over 150 years and more than 1,000 lawyers. Recently, the firm struck a deal with President Trump to avoid the repercussions of an executive order that threatened to suspend its security clearances and access to federal buildings. In exchange for lifting the order, Paul Weiss agreed to provide $40 million worth of pro bono work on initiatives supported by Trump, including veteran services and combating antisemitism. This decision has sparked criticism, with some accusing the firm of compromising its principles by capitulating to Trump instead of opposing him legally.

Despite its current partnership with the Trump administration, Paul Weiss has a legacy of employing prominent Democrats, including former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams and ex-Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The firm has a diverse background, having been one of the few in its early years to hire Jewish lawyers during a time of discrimination. Its principles emphasize diversity and responsibility to the community and profession. Chairman Brad Karp reassured employees that the agreement aligns with the firm's values. With over $2.6 billion in revenue last year, Paul Weiss continues to serve major corporations while also engaging in public service work.
