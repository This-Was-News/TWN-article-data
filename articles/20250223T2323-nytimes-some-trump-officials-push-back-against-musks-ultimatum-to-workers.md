## Article summary
Several Trump-appointed agency leaders have advised federal employees not to comply with Elon Musk's directive to summarize their weekly accomplishments, warning that non-compliance could be interpreted as resignation. This response challenges Musk's authority, which has been bolstered by President Trump's support for his cost-cutting initiatives. The directive, sent via email, reached various agencies including the F.B.I. and the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, prompting officials to instruct employees to refrain from responding. Concerns have arisen regarding the implications of Musk's demands on sensitive work, particularly within the intelligence community.

While Musk characterized his request as a "pulse check," officials expressed alarm over the potential for misuse of information and the perceived overreach of his influence. The response from agency leaders reflects a growing unease within the Trump administration about Musk's power and the ramifications of his public statements. Unions representing federal workers have denounced Musk's order as unlawful, urging adherence to internal guidance instead. Some officials, including members of Congress, have criticized Musk's approach as disrespectful to federal employees. The situation highlights a significant conflict between Musk's directives and the established protocols of federal agencies.
