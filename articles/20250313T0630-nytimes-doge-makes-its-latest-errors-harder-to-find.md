## Article summary
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has faced scrutiny for publishing erroneous data on its website that exaggerates its success in saving taxpayer money. Recently, the group obscured details of its claims, making it difficult for the public to verify its reported savings of $10 billion from terminating 3,489 federal grants. This shift towards less transparency contradicts Musk's earlier promises of maximum openness. The New York Times managed to uncover inaccuracies in DOGE's claims, revealing that many reported savings were inflated or incorrect, including a significant claim regarding a U.S. Agency for International Development grant that had not been terminated. Nonprofits affected by the grant terminations disputed DOGE's interpretations of potential savings, stating that the government had not promised those funds. As DOGE continues to add unverified claims, critics argue that the lack of detailed information undermines the group's credibility and accountability. The website's source code initially contained identifiers for grants that allowed for verification, but this information was later removed. Observers express concern that without accessible data, it becomes increasingly challenging to assess the group's actual impact. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between government transparency and the handling of public funds.
