## Article summary
President Trump announced a trade deal with Japan, setting "reciprocal" tariffs at 15%, which he described as a "massive Deal" that will see Japan invest $550 billion in the U.S. The agreement aims to open Japan's market to U.S. cars, trucks, rice, and other agricultural products, with the U.S. retaining 90% of the profits from Japan's investment. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged the deal, stating it would benefit both sides, despite earlier threats of a 24% tariff that he called a "national crisis." The deal follows Trump's direct involvement in tariff negotiations and comes after Japan's ruling coalition suffered a setback in recent elections. The agreement also includes Japan's commitment to buying 100 Boeing aircraft and lifting restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks, granting U.S. automakers access to the Japanese market.
