## Article summary
At the G7 summit in Canada, President Trump reignited his controversial support for Russia, suggesting that the country should have been allowed to remain in the group after its expulsion in 2014 due to its aggression in Ukraine. He blamed former President Obama and Canadian leaders for the decision, claiming that Russia's inclusion could have prevented the ongoing war in Ukraine. Trump's remarks drew parallels to his previous calls for Russia's re-admittance during the 2018 summit, which alienated American allies. As he prepared to meet with Ukraine's President Zelensky, Trump continued to express admiration for Putin, asserting that the Russian leader was insulted by his exclusion from the G7. Former national security adviser John Bolton criticized Trump for his misunderstanding of the bloc's history and purpose. While Trump acknowledged the need for sanctions against Russia, he downplayed their implementation and expressed skepticism about their effectiveness. His comments reflected a shifting stance on the Ukraine conflict, as he appeared more interested in rehabilitating Putin than supporting consensus efforts among allies. The dynamics at the summit suggested a divide, with European leaders pushing for stricter sanctions against Russia. Ultimately, Trump's approach to the summit highlighted his growing isolation from traditional allies amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.
