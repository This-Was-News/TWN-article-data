## Article summary
President Trump announced that the U.S. will resume sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine after a brief pause in shipments, as requested by the Pentagon. This decision follows a significant escalation of Russian attacks, with the Ukrainian military reporting the largest airstrikes since the invasion began in February 2022. Trump emphasized the need for Ukraine to defend itself against these attacks and expressed disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Pentagon had previously halted shipments due to concerns over low stockpiles, a move that raised questions about U.S. military capabilities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a productive conversation with Trump regarding air defense needs, which included discussions on joint drone production with western allies. The urgency for air defense is underscored by reports indicating that Russia may soon launch up to 1,000 attack drones daily. Analysts suggest that as long as the war appears to be favoring Putin, he is unlikely to seek a ceasefire. Additionally, proposed sanctions against Russia and tariffs on countries buying Russian oil are being discussed in the U.S. Congress. Overall, the situation remains critical for Ukraine as it seeks support from its allies to counter escalating threats.
