## Article summary
President Trump's recent tariff announcements have shown a distinct favoritism towards Mexico, granting it a 90-day reprieve, while imposing higher tariffs on Canada, raising them to 35% from 25%. This disparity in treatment has led many Canadians to speculate that Trump's actions are part of a strategy to force Canada's annexation as the 51st state through economic turmoil. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that his government will continue negotiations with the U.S. while focusing on strengthening Canada domestically. The sudden increase in tariffs is seen as a political setback for Carney, who was elected just over three months ago. Despite the challenges, Carney emphasizes that Canadians will remain their own best customers.
