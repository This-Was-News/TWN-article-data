## Article summary
In Kennett, Missouri, a town that had solid support for Donald Trump, the detention of Ming Li Hui, known as Carol, has sparked a community-wide debate on immigration policies. Carol, a 45-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong, was arrested by federal authorities for overstaying her tourist visa, leading to her detention and impending deportation. Many residents, who previously supported Trump's immigration stance, are now questioning how they can support both Carol and the president's policies. Carol, a beloved figure in the community, worked multiple jobs and was actively involved with her family and church. Despite her past, including a sham marriage for residency, residents rallied around her, organizing fundraisers and prayer vigils. The local response highlights a growing unease about the practical implications of strict immigration enforcement. While some residents support her deportation, many express sympathy and disbelief at her situation. Carol's story has ignited discussions about the impact of immigration policies on families and communities, showing a divide in public opinion. As her legal team works to reopen her case, Carol remains separated from her children, who miss her deeply.
