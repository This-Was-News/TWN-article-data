## Article summary
Ukraine executed a large-scale drone strike against Russian air bases on Sunday, targeting locations from eastern Siberia to the western border, resulting in several Russian aircraft being set ablaze. This attack followed a devastating Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian military training base, which killed at least 12 soldiers. The escalation in violence comes as both sides prepare for cease-fire negotiations in Istanbul, with Ukraine accusing Russia of stalling in talks. Russia's Defense Ministry reported that drones attacked airfields across five regions, with significant damage claimed by Ukrainian officials. President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the operation as a brilliant success and emphasized Ukraine's self-defense. Videos showed drones being launched from trucks near the targeted bases, although their exact origins remain unconfirmed. Russian military bloggers criticized the effectiveness of Russia's defenses in light of the attacks. Ukraine's military acknowledged the casualties from the Russian strike and emphasized accountability among its commanders. As the conflict intensifies, Ukraine's delegation is set to attend peace talks, even without receiving Russia's cease-fire terms. In response, Russia conducted its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, launching numerous drones and missiles, with some damage reported in multiple regions.
