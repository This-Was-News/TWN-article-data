## Article summary
Poland is significantly strengthening its military in response to perceived threats from Russia, particularly in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The country plans to allocate nearly 5% of its GDP to defense, the highest among NATO members, as it prepares for potential invasion scenarios. Military ceremonies are taking place, with new recruits like Dominik Milewski swearing in to protect their homeland. Poland is enhancing its border defenses with concrete anti-tank structures and land mines, learning from Ukraine's experience. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has called for military training for all Polish men to ensure readiness for war. 

Poland is also withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention, which bans land mines, to bolster its defenses. U.S. troops are conducting training exercises in Poland to support NATO's eastern front, particularly in the strategic Suwalki Gap. Security experts note that Poland is considering seeking defense support from France, given concerns about the U.S.'s commitment under President Trump's administration. Strategic deals between Poland and France may soon be established, potentially including nuclear protection, which could enhance Poland's security against Russian aggression. Overall, Poland is taking extensive measures to prepare for any threats from Russia.
