## Article summary
Chinese companies are increasingly targeting Brazil as they seek new markets amid intense domestic competition and trade tensions with the U.S. and Europe. Brazil, with its large population and growing economy, is particularly attractive for Chinese e-commerce and delivery firms aiming to export their low-cost business models. Major players like Meituan and Mixue are making significant investments, with Meituan committing $1 billion to establish operations. The deepening economic ties between China and Brazil have fostered confidence among Chinese businesses, with trade between the two countries doubling over the past decade. However, success is not guaranteed, as local regulations and market dynamics may pose challenges. Chinese firms are focusing on market dominance over immediate profits, employing aggressive tactics similar to those used in China. Despite facing increased scrutiny and competition in their home market, companies like Shein and Didi have already made notable inroads in Brazil. The evolving regulatory landscape in China and changes in U.S. trade policies further drive the urgency for these companies to expand internationally. Overall, the push into Brazil reflects a strategic shift as Chinese firms adapt to a stagnant domestic economy.
