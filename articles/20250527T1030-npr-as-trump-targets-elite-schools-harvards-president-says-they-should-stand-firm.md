## Article summary
Harvard University President Alan Garber asserts that elite institutions must remain committed to their principles amidst actions taken by the Trump administration, which has frozen over $2 billion in research funding and attempted to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Garber finds the administration's measures perplexing and argues that cutting research funding ultimately harms the nation. He emphasizes the importance of international students, who comprise a quarter of Harvard's student body, in fostering a diverse and open academic environment. The administration's actions are viewed as retaliatory and a cultural battle against universities like Harvard, which are seen as failing to address antisemitism effectively.

Garber acknowledges that while there are issues on campus, the link between funding cuts and combating antisemitism is unclear. He highlights recent achievements by Harvard faculty in scientific research that benefit public health. Garber warns that the administration's approach serves as a cautionary tale for other universities, indicating that non-compliance with federal demands could lead to similar consequences. He calls for educational institutions to reaffirm their commitment to truth and knowledge, stressing the broader societal benefits of their work. Ultimately, Garber believes that higher education plays a crucial role in serving both the nation and the world.
