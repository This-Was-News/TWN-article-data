## Article summary
Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, has come under fire for defending President Trump and Vice President JD Vance's public criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During a televised exchange, Zelensky attempted to articulate Ukraine's need for U.S. support amid the ongoing conflict with Russia, which Rubio claims disrupted peace efforts. Rubio accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and hindering Trump's attempts to broker peace. He expressed confusion over the backlash against the administration, arguing that Trump was being unfairly criticized for trying to prevent further destruction in the region. 

Rubio's comments have drawn sharp criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, with Senator Chris Van Hollen expressing regret for supporting Rubio's nomination and accusing him of abandoning American values. Rubio had previously shown strong support for Ukraine when the invasion began in 2022, emphasizing the need for U.S. backing against Russian aggression. He also warned that allowing Russia to expand its territory could set a dangerous precedent for other nations, like China. The situation reflects a significant shift in Rubio's stance and has sparked debate over U.S. foreign policy regarding Ukraine.
