## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's abrupt reversal on tariffs amid financial turmoil sparked by his own policies. Initially, Trump urged calm and expressed confidence in his approach, but rising government bond yields prompted him to pause reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. Senior advisors, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, feared a financial panic and advocated for a more structured trade strategy focused on isolating China. Despite Trump's insistence on his original tariff plan, he ultimately acknowledged the impact of jittery markets on his decision. His administration attempted to frame the pause as part of a strategic negotiation tactic, despite evidence suggesting it was a reaction to market pressures. The article highlights the confusion surrounding Trump's tariff strategy, with many officials unaware of the policy shift until the last minute. As Trump navigated these challenges, he maintained that his decisions were instinctual rather than calculated. The financial markets reacted positively to the tariff pause, raising questions about future clarity on exemptions and the overall direction of his trade policy. Ultimately, the situation underscores the tension between Trump's instincts and the economic realities faced by his administration.
