The article discusses Donald Trump's serious remarks about the possibility of seeking a third term as president, despite the Constitution's 22nd Amendment prohibiting such an action. In an interview with NBC News, Trump stated he is "not joking" about this ambition and mentioned that many people have encouraged him to pursue it. He noted that there are methods to potentially achieve a third term, such as a two-thirds vote in Congress or a constitutional convention, though he did not elaborate on specific plans.

Trump's comments come amidst ongoing political discussions and encouragement from his allies, including former adviser Steve Bannon. He emphasized that he is currently focused on his administration and has a long way to go before considering a third term.
