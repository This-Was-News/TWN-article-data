## Article summary
The article discusses Europe’s consideration of a peacekeeping role in Ukraine in response to President Trump's perceived abandonment of traditional allies and his embrace of Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron convened military chiefs from over 30 countries to explore the formation of a multinational peacekeeping force to support Ukraine, emphasizing the need for a credible and long-term commitment. The meeting highlighted a growing consensus in Europe that the defense of Ukraine is integral to the continent's security amid rising tensions with Russia. Macron and other leaders expressed concerns about the unpredictability of American support, particularly in light of Trump’s recent actions.

The proposed European force is envisioned as a deterrent, with estimates suggesting a deployment of 15,000 to 20,000 troops, though this is subject to significant challenges, including potential Russian hostility. Ukraine's President Zelensky has called for a larger security force, but logistical and political hurdles may limit European capabilities. The article also notes a shift in European sentiment towards military rearmament and self-sufficiency in defense matters, driven by frustration with U.S. foreign policy. The urgency for Europe to build a credible military presence and improve cooperation among nations is underscored, as discussions continue on how to effectively respond to the evolving security landscape.
