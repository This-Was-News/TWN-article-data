## Article summary
The Boston Public Library, one of the oldest and largest library systems in the country, is launching a project with OpenAI and Harvard Law School to make its vast collection of historically significant government documents more accessible to the public. These documents, dating back to the early 1800s, include oral histories, congressional reports, and industry surveys. Currently, public access to these documents requires an in-person visit, but the project aims to enhance metadata and enable global online access. The library plans to digitize 5,000 documents by the end of the year, with the help of Harvard University researchers who are training AI models to improve the searchability of library collections. AI companies, including Microsoft and OpenAI, fund these efforts in exchange for access to high-quality, out-of-copyright materials for training their models. The partnership aims to improve data quality and accessibility while protecting the integrity of the materials. OpenAI is helping cover costs such as scanning and project management, with no exclusive rights to the digitized data. Library professionals emphasize the benefits of broader access to information and the importance of trained professionals in curating and categorizing the data. However, they also express caution about cultural differences between public institutions and corporations, highlighting the need for careful collaboration.
