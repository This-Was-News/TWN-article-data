## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government's plan to seize control of Gaza City and the remaining parts of Gaza not already under Israeli control, despite widespread protests and international condemnation. The plan, approved by Israel's Security Cabinet, involves the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, with Netanyahu stating that around 75% of Gaza is already under Israeli military control. He claimed that the plan aims to end the war swiftly and that civilians would be moved to designated safe zones with ample food, water, and medical care, though details on how this would be executed were not provided. Israel faces international criticism for starvation in Gaza and what experts describe as an unfolding famine. Palestinians in Gaza City expressed reluctance to leave, fearing displacement and further hardship. Netanyahu also outlined Israel's long-term plan for Gaza, including the establishment of a non-Israeli civilian administration and Israel maintaining overriding security responsibility. Protests erupted across Israel, with tens of thousands demonstrating against the expanded offensive in Gaza. The U.N. Security Council met to discuss Israel's new offensive, with many world leaders condemning the plan. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. supported Israel's right to decide measures necessary for its security. Netanyahu's office reported that he spoke with President Trump, who expressed steadfast support for Israel.
