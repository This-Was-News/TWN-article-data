## Article summary
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that the Philippines would inevitably be drawn into any war over Taiwan due to its proximity and the presence of many Filipino workers there, despite China's protests. Marcos also affirmed that the Philippines would not back down in defending its territorial interests in the South China Sea, following a recent incident where Chinese coast guard vessels used dangerous blocking maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine vessels at the disputed Scarborough Shoal. Tensions in the South China Sea have escalated, with overlapping claims from China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. Relations between China and the Philippines have worsened, as Marcos' administration has been vocal against China's aggressive actions and has strengthened alliances with the U.S. and other Western and Asian countries. China protested Marcos' remarks, accusing him of interfering in its internal affairs and violating the One China policy. Marcos responded that he was merely stating facts and that the Philippines would be pulled into a Taiwan conflict despite not wanting war. Meanwhile, a Philippine coast guard vessel managed to evade a Chinese water cannon and offered assistance after a Chinese coast guard ship collided with a Chinese navy ship. Marcos reiterated that the Philippines would continue to defend its territory and sovereign rights in the South China Sea, regardless of opposition.
