## Article summary
A Ukrainian drone strike killed one person and injured two others in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod, as fighting persists ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The governor of Nizhny Novgorod reported that drones targeted two industrial zones, causing unspecified damage. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have intercepted and destroyed 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning across several regions and the annexed Crimean Peninsula. The upcoming summit in Alaska will see Putin pushing for a peace deal that secures Russian gains and prevents Ukraine from joining NATO, aiming to keep Ukraine under Moscow's influence. Putin believes he holds the advantage as Ukrainian forces struggle to halt Russian advances along the extensive front. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy firmly rejects any Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory and insists on NATO membership for his country. European leaders support Ukraine, stating that peace cannot be achieved without Kyiv's involvement. On the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers see an end to the war, anticipating only a brief respite before Moscow intensifies its attacks.
