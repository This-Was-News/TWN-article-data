## Article summary
Small businesses across the U.S. are struggling with the economic impacts of President Trump's tariffs, tax policies, and budget decisions. Large corporations and high-income households may weather these changes more easily, but small business owners like Katrina Golden of Ll Mamas Sweets & Treats face significant challenges. Golden received a notice about upcoming tariffs on her paper coffee cups but couldn't afford to lock in the current price, highlighting the lack of financial cushion for small businesses. Smaller firms also lack the bargaining power of larger retailers to negotiate lower prices and often can't afford long-term contracts to stabilize costs. Doug and Betsy Scheffel of ETM Manufacturing in Littleton, Mass., are dealing with soaring costs for aluminum and steel due to 50% tariffs, making it difficult to plan for the future. Legrand Lendor of LMI Textiles in Milton, Mass., is also grappling with increased prices and administrative burdens related to customs and taxes. Both are members of Small Business for America's Future, a group advocating against unpredictable tariff policies and advocating for policies that support small businesses. Rising costs are affecting Golden's business, with supplies and ingredients increasing by 20-25% since January. She is uncertain about hiring more staff due to policy instability. The overall average effective tariff rate has risen to 18.6% from 2.4% in January, disproportionately affecting lower-income households. Oxford Economics estimates that the bottom fifth of income earners will see their real disposable income decrease by 2.5-3%, while the top fifth will see an increase due to tax cuts. Golden is considering raising prices to cope with the financial strain, fearing that her business may not survive if conditions don't improve.
