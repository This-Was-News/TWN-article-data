## Article summary
Federal agents were deployed across Washington, D.C., on Sunday night following President Donald Trump's announcement of a swift crackdown on crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. Trump stated that homeless individuals must leave immediately and promised to target criminals, though he did not specify where the homeless would be relocated. Despite Trump's claims, crime rates in D.C. have been declining, with violent crime hitting a 30-year low in 2024. The immediate impact of Trump's actions appeared less dramatic than his social media posts suggested, with small groups of federal agents patrolling the streets. Locals and tourists observed the agents, while some homeless residents expressed fear and concern over potential displacement. Greg Evans, a homeless resident, shared his struggles with addiction and health problems, expressing hope for compassion from the federal government. George Morgan, another homeless resident, criticized Trump's rhetoric and called for better use of the nation's wealth to support those in need. Trump also mentioned plans to beautify the capital and suggested a federal takeover of policing in D.C. if the city does not address his concerns. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged Trump's concerns about homelessness but stated that the situation is improving and that she will continue to work with the president on high-priority issues.
