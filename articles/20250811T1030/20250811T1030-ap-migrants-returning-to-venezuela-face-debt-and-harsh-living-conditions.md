## Article summary
Venezuelan migrants returning home face severe challenges. Yosbeln Pérez, who attempted to migrate to the U.S. but returned, now struggles with debt and harsh living conditions. She owes $5,000 and earns little from selling aluminum cookware. Over 7.7 million Venezuelans have migrated since 2013, with many initially finding opportunities in the U.S. However, recent policy changes have led to increased deportations. Returning migrants find Venezuela's economic crisis worse, with hyperinflation and unaffordable basic necessities. Many, like Pérez, face extortion and limited job prospects. Some migrants, like David Rodríguez, faced setbacks and debt after failed migration attempts. The Venezuelan government has declared an economic emergency, but conditions remain dire. Returning migrants often rely on loans and multiple jobs to survive, highlighting the stark realities of their situation.
