## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of recent immigration policy changes under the Trump administration on manufacturing plants, particularly GE Appliances and Kraft Heinz. Workers protected under Obama-era programs, such as the CHNV program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for various countries, have lost their authorization to work. This has led to stress and uncertainty among remaining employees, who must take on additional responsibilities and train new workers. Jaeln Carpenter, a team leader at GE Appliances, describes the sudden departure of four coworkers as deeply disruptive. Tom Torres, a mechanic at Kraft Heinz, highlights the hard work and dedication of immigrant workers who are now being forced out. Employers like GE Appliances and Kraft Heinz report staffing challenges, with some positions left unfilled. The Greater Louisville Inc. chamber of commerce advocates for increased immigration to address workforce shortages. The article also notes the demographic shifts in Louisville, where international migration is crucial for population and workforce growth. With more TPS expirations looming, the situation is expected to worsen, potentially leaving significant gaps in the workforce. The human toll of these policies is evident in the stories of workers like Carpenter and Torres, who express concern and empathy for their affected colleagues.
