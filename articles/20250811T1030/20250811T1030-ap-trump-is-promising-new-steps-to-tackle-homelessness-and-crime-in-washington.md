## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced plans to address homelessness and crime in Washington, D.C., prompting concerns from Mayor Muriel Bowser about the potential use of the National Guard. Trump stated that homeless individuals would be relocated away from the capital and criminals would be jailed. He directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in the city and considered deploying the D.C. National Guard. Bowser questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard for local law enforcement and suggested funding more prosecutors instead. She noted that violent crime in D.C. has decreased since a rise in 2023, contradicting Trump's portrayal of the city as dangerous. Trump criticized the district's conditions and was influenced by a recent assault on a prominent figure in the Department of Government Efficiency. He also hinted at possible federal takeover of Washington, D.C., which would require repealing the Home Rule Act of 1973. Bowser asserted that current crime levels do not justify such federal intervention. Trump's upcoming White House news conference aims to discuss his plans to make D.C. safer and more beautiful. The White House declined to provide additional details about the announcement.
