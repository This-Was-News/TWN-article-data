## Article summary
European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Fredrich Merz, have urged for Ukraine to be included in the upcoming peace talks between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin in Alaska. They emphasized that any path to peace in Ukraine must involve Ukraine and cannot be decided without their inclusion. The leaders also stressed the need for robust security guarantees for Ukraine. This follows a meeting between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy with Ukrainian and European officials. Vance described the Trump-Putin meeting as a major breakthrough for American diplomacy, aiming for a negotiated settlement that both Ukraine and Russia can live with. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has maintained that Ukraine will not give up any land and that it is up to Putin to end the war. Zelenskyy supports Trump's efforts but has not confirmed his attendance at the Alaska meeting. The European leaders also called for active diplomacy, support for Ukraine, and pressure on Russia to end the illegal war. The summit in Alaska is set to discuss an end to the war, with Vance noting that scheduling and other logistical details are being figured out.
