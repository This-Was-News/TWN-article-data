## Article summary
Denver air traffic controllers experienced a communications outage lasting about two minutes on Monday due to multiple radio transmitter failures, affecting pilots flying into Denver International Airport. Frank McIntosh, the FAA's deputy chief operating officer, confirmed to Congress that one radio frequency was lost, prompting controllers to switch to a backup and then to an emergency frequency. The FAA reported that the outage occurred at approximately 1:50 p.m. and lasted around 90 seconds, during which aircraft remained safely separated. Despite reports from a Denver news station suggesting the outage lasted at least six minutes, McIntosh deemed this "over exaggerated." 

The incident involved as many as 20 pilots who were unable to communicate with air traffic control, raising concerns amid scrutiny of the FAA following other communication and radar outages. The FAA is currently without a permanent head, as President Trump appointed acting Administrator Chris Rocheleau after the previous head resigned on Inauguration Day. McIntosh faced questioning from lawmakers about the safety of the civil aviation industry, with Rep. Robert Garcia expressing concern over the system failures. 

The situation is compounded by previous incidents, including a midair collision that resulted in 67 fatalities, and ongoing issues at Newark Liberty International Airport. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has indicated plans to modernize the air traffic control system, which could cost at least $12.5 billion, although specific proposals have not yet been outlined.
