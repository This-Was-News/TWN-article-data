## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faces a lawsuit from several prominent medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, over his recent decision to remove COVID-19 vaccines from the recommendation list for healthy children and pregnant women. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, claims that this action was arbitrary and violated federal law governing vaccine recommendations. The plaintiffs argue that Kennedy's changes undermine public trust in vaccines and threaten the nation's vaccine infrastructure. Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, emphasized that children's health is at stake due to these changes. The lawsuit seeks to reverse Kennedy's decision and declare it unlawful. It also highlights concerns over Kennedy's removal of experts from a federal vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with his own choices. Legal experts believe the case could hinge on whether proper procedures, as outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, were followed. The lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts, where some affected plaintiffs reside, including a pregnant physician concerned about vaccine access. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services stated that Kennedy stands by his reforms.
