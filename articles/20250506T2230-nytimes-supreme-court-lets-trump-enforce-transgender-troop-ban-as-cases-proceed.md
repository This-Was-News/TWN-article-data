## Article summary
The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to enforce a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, which had previously been blocked by lower courts. This brief, unsigned ruling will remain in effect while legal challenges proceed. The ban, issued on Trump's second day in office, reverses a policy from President Biden that permitted open service for transgender troops. The Defense Department implemented the ban in February, affecting approximately 4,200 current service members. The ruling comes amid broader attacks on transgender rights by the Trump administration. 

Several plaintiffs, including Cmdr. Emily Shilling, challenged the ban, arguing it violates the Constitution's equal protection clause. Judge Benjamin H. Settle had previously issued an injunction against the policy, stating that there was no evidence it harmed military cohesion or readiness. The Supreme Court's decision has been met with disappointment from advocacy groups, who view it as detrimental to transgender service members. The administration argued that the new policy is similar to a previously allowed one, though challengers disputed this claim. Legal battles continue as courts consider related issues, including a Tennessee law banning transition care for transgender youth.
