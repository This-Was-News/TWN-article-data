## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced the revocation of approximately $11.4 billion in federal funding aimed at addiction and mental health care, citing the end of the COVID-19 pandemic as justification. Experts warn that this decision could disrupt critical services and lead to layoffs in public health departments and nonprofit organizations. The funding cuts are seen as particularly concerning given that drug overdoses still claim over 84,000 lives annually in the U.S. Despite a decline in overdose rates attributed to increased funding under the Biden administration, critics argue that these cuts could reverse progress.

State leaders from both parties have condemned the decision, highlighting the significant impact it will have on local health services, particularly in areas already facing health crises. The cuts are part of a broader restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which may include further reductions to Medicaid funding, the primary source of treatment coverage for many Americans struggling with addiction. HHS officials downplayed the risks, stating that most rescinded grants were tied to outdated pandemic-related programs. However, addiction advocates express concern that effective treatment programs could be jeopardized at a time when the need for support remains high.
