## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced significant changes to the U.S. Department of Education, stating that federal student loans and special education programs will be moved to other federal agencies. The management of the federal student loan portfolio, which holds about $1.6 trillion in loans for approximately 43 million borrowers, will be transferred to the Small Business Administration (SBA). Trump indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services would oversee special education, specifically referencing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This act guarantees students with disabilities access to appropriate education and funding for special education services. 

The announcement follows recent actions to reduce the Education Department's workforce, leading to concerns about the transition of expertise from the Office of Federal Student Aid. Trump's decision was met with surprise by many employees within the Education Department. The implications of these transfers, including potential legislative requirements for such significant changes, remain unclear. The administration has previously stated that core functions of the Education Department would continue, but specifics about funding and oversight are still being determined. This restructuring reflects Trump's ongoing efforts to dismantle the Education Department, which he believes has been ineffective in managing these responsibilities.
