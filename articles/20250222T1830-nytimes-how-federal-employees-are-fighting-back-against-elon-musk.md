## Article summary
Federal employees are actively resisting the influence of Elon Musk and his team within government agencies, employing various methods to push back against what they perceive as detrimental actions. Civil servants at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filmed Musk's aides entering their building and confronted them about their credentials. Some have resigned, filed lawsuits, and organized protests, while others have joined unions in significant numbers, indicating a collective desire to challenge the new administration's directives. The American Federation of Government Employees has seen a surge in membership, reflecting heightened discontent among federal workers.

Karen Ortiz, an administrative judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, faced retaliation after urging her colleagues to resist executive orders she deemed illegal. This included having her email access revoked after she called for the resignation of the commission's acting chair. The Trump administration has responded to this dissent with firings and attempts to limit avenues for employees to voice grievances, intensifying the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

Despite these challenges, federal workers remain determined to advocate for their rights and uphold their responsibilities, fostering a movement aimed at broader resistance against Musk's influence and the administration's policies. The situation underscores a growing tension between civil service values and the current political landscape.
