## Article summary
The article discusses the negative impact of President Trump's policies on the U.S. economy, which was initially performing well with low unemployment and rising consumer spending. Recent economic forecasts have worsened due to uncertainties stemming from federal layoffs, tariffs, and immigration policies. Business and consumer confidence have declined, and some analysts predict potential recessionary conditions, although most economists believe growth will merely slow. Trump's tariffs are expected to increase prices and hinder growth, while job cuts may lead to higher unemployment and reduced consumer spending. The uncertainty surrounding his economic strategies could delay business investments and hiring. While some aspects of Trump's agenda might support growth, the chaotic implementation of policies raises concerns about long-term economic stability. The article highlights the potential for gradual economic damage rather than an immediate crisis, particularly affecting communities reliant on federal jobs. Overall, the document illustrates how Trump's approach has shaken the previously solid economic outlook.
