## Article summary
An early intelligence assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that the recent U.S. airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear facilities only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months, contrary to President Trump's claims of total destruction. The assessment was shared with select senators, raising concerns about Iran potentially pursuing a nuclear weapon. The White House denied the assessment, asserting that significant damage was done to a key facility. Following a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, Trump maintained that Iran would not achieve nuclear capabilities. However, Iranian officials contradicted this, affirming their intention to continue uranium enrichment. The U.S. strikes, which utilized bunker-buster bombs, primarily affected three nuclear sites, including Fordo, but experts noted that critical infrastructure remained intact. Analysts emphasized that Iran's nuclear knowledge is a key factor that cannot be easily destroyed. The situation remains complex, with ongoing debates about the effectiveness of military action against Iran's nuclear ambitions.
