## Article summary
The U.S. military, in coordination with Israel, has conducted strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, marking a significant escalation in regional tensions. President Trump announced the successful attacks on the Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan sites, claiming the objective was to dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities. He expressed hope for peace but warned that further military action could follow if necessary. The strikes utilized powerful bunker-buster bombs, specifically designed to penetrate heavily fortified locations. Criticism arose from Democratic leaders, who argued that Trump's actions violated constitutional requirements for congressional approval of military action. The strikes come amid a backdrop of escalating conflict, including previous Israeli airstrikes on Iran and Iranian missile responses targeting Israel. While Israel views Iran's nuclear ambitions as an existential threat, U.S. intelligence has previously assessed that Iran suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003. Trump's rhetoric has shifted from seeking negotiations to a more aggressive stance against Iran, claiming that the U.S. maintains control over the skies. The situation now introduces a new layer of uncertainty in an already volatile region.
