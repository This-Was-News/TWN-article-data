## Article summary
Mario Guevara, a journalist known for covering immigration issues in Georgia, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after being arrested while reporting on a protest against Trump administration immigration policies. Guevara, originally from El Salvador and living in the U.S. for over 20 years, held a work permit and Social Security number but was not a legal permanent resident or citizen. His legal team plans to challenge his detention, believing he has a defendable case. Guevara gained a significant following for documenting immigration arrests and has worked for various news organizations, including Mundo Hispánico and his own MGNews.

During the protest, he was livestreaming when police approached, leading to his arrest on charges including obstruction and unlawful assembly. Eyewitness accounts suggest he was complying with police orders when he was taken into custody. The Committee to Protect Journalists has called for his release, highlighting concerns about press freedom in the U.S. Guevara's family expressed disappointment over his detention, especially as they had prepared to celebrate Father's Day with him. His daughter described the situation as very sad for the family.
