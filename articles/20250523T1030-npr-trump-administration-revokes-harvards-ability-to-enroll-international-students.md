## Article summary
The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, as stated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This decision, communicated in a letter to the university, affects currently enrolled international students. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem emphasized that the administration is holding Harvard accountable for issues like violence and antisemitism on campus. Harvard has responded by calling the action "unlawful," arguing that it threatens the university's mission and the welfare of its community. Nearly 7,000 international students, making up about 27% of Harvard's student body, are now facing uncertainty regarding their education and future work opportunities in the U.S. Students expressed concerns about feeling like outsiders and the potential impact on their internships and jobs. The situation could lead to a range of outcomes, including possible legal action from Harvard against the government. International students are vital to U.S. higher education, contributing over $43 billion to the economy last academic year. The community is now anxiously awaiting Harvard's next steps in response to this order.
