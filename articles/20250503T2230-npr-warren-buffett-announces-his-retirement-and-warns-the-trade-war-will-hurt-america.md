Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his retirement, stating he will step down at the end of the year, during the company's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha. He emphasized the detrimental effects of the ongoing trade war, asserting that "trade should not be a weapon" and advocating for open trade with the world. Buffett's comments came amid concerns over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which have created uncertainty in financial markets and raised recession alarms. He received a warm reception from the audience, highlighting his influence and popularity among investors. 

Buffett framed his opposition to tariffs as a matter of national security, suggesting that global prosperity directly contributes to American safety and economic well-being. The meeting, often referred to as "Woodstock for Capitalists," attracted nearly 20,000 attendees, showcasing a festive atmosphere filled with Berkshire-owned brand displays. Despite his retirement announcement, Buffett's legacy as a powerful figure in business and finance remains significant. Berkshire Hathaway reported a sharp decline in quarterly profits, citing the unpredictability of tariffs on its diverse operations.
