## Article summary
The investigation into the January 29 collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport revealed that multiple failures contributed to the tragedy, which resulted in the deaths of all on board the aircraft. The Black Hawk crew inadequately executed the "see and avoid" practice, crucial for avoiding nearby air traffic, which led them directly into the jet's landing path. The air traffic controller, while monitoring the situation, failed to provide clear, urgent warnings to the Black Hawk crew as the two aircraft converged. Technology issues exacerbated the situation, as radio communications were disrupted, and critical tracking technology on the Black Hawk was turned off due to mission confidentiality. The controller's attempt to manage a complex traffic situation, referred to as a "squeeze play," involved landing the jet on a less commonly used runway, which created a narrow vertical space between the helicopter and the jet. Additionally, the Black Hawk pilot did not heed her co-pilot's directive to change course, which could have averted the collision. Overall, the investigation underscores that the crash was not due to a single error but rather a series of missteps and systemic failures.
