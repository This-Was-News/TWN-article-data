## Article summary
The article "Bread Lines and Salty Drinking Water: Israeli Aid Block Sets Gaza Back Again" discusses the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza following Israel's blockade of aid shipments. After a brief surge in aid due to a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Israel halted all goods entering Gaza on March 2, 2025, seeking to pressure Hamas in truce negotiations. The blockade has led to desperate food shortages, with long lines forming at bakeries and skyrocketing prices for basic necessities. Panic buying and price gouging by traders have exacerbated the situation, forcing many residents to rely on canned food.

Despite initial improvements in nutrition for vulnerable populations during the cease-fire, health officials report increasing malnutrition risks due to the lack of fresh produce. Aid groups and the United Nations have criticized Israel's use of humanitarian relief as a bargaining tool, arguing it violates international law. The blockade has also cut off access to essential services, such as electricity and clean drinking water, further endangering the health of Gaza's residents. As supplies dwindle, aid organizations are struggling to meet immediate needs and support long-term recovery efforts. The article highlights the ongoing suffering of Gazans, who face not only the immediate challenges of survival but also the psychological toll of living in a prolonged state of crisis.
