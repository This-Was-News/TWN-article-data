## Article summary
President Donald Trump has vowed to change how elections are conducted in the U.S., but the Constitution limits his power to do so independently. Trump, relying on false information and conspiracy theories, aims to eliminate mail voting and voting machines, systems that helped him win the 2024 election and Republicans gain control of Congress. His recent social media post escalates his rhetoric and promises another executive order to ensure 'HONESTY' in the 2026 midterm elections. Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. is the only country using mail voting, when in fact, many countries, including Germany and the UK, also use it. His claims about voting machines being more expensive than watermark paper are also misleading, as watermarks cannot replace voting machines. The Constitution grants states the authority to determine the time, place, and manner of elections, not the president. Courts have blocked parts of Trump's previous executive orders on elections, affirming that Congress, not the president, sets federal election rules. Despite Republican control of Congress, changing federal election rules would be challenging due to potential Democratic filibusters. Trump's focus on election changes signals his ongoing obsession with altering election processes, raising concerns about potential meddling.
