## Article summary
A Maine police officer, Jon Luke Evans, who was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has agreed to voluntarily leave the country. Evans, a reserve officer from Jamaica, was detained on July 25 as part of ICE's increased immigration enforcement efforts. Local officials stated they were informed by federal authorities that Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S. and that the town used the E-Verify program to confirm his employment eligibility. ICE officials accused the town of relying too heavily on the E-Verify system. Evans' arrest sparked a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. A judge granted Evans voluntary departure, allowing him to leave the U.S. at his own expense to avoid deportation. Evans was initially held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island but was later transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials stated that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm. The town reaffirmed its commitment to complying with state and federal employment laws.
