## Article summary
The Justice Department has agreed to provide Congress with documents from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation, as announced by a key House lawmaker. The records will be handed over starting Friday to the House Oversight Committee, which had issued a broad subpoena earlier this month. The committee's subpoena sought all documents and communications from the case files of Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as records about communications between President Joe Biden's administration and the Justice Department regarding Epstein. It also demanded documents related to an earlier federal investigation into Epstein in Florida that resulted in a non-prosecution agreement in 2007. The move appears to avert a potential separation of powers clash, at least temporarily. Epstein, a wealthy and well-connected financier, was found dead in his New York jail cell in 2019, ruled a suicide. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The Justice Department has not yet commented on the matter.
