## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky adopted a more formal attire for his meeting with President Trump, swapping his usual military-style clothing for a black field jacket, shirt, and slacks. This change in appearance sparked speculation about potential concessions. Zelensky's previous attire, which included olive green or black shirts, pants, and combat boots, had become a symbol of his wartime leadership and solidarity with Ukrainian forces. His consistent look was a deliberate choice, even when meeting other world leaders. The new look first appeared in April at Pope Francis's funeral and was designed by Ukrainian designer Viktor Ansmov. This ensemble, described as a restrained and dignified image, was also worn during meetings with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and at the NATO summit. The change in Zelensky's attire was noted and approved by Trump, who had previously commented on Zelensky's clothing. The new look signaled a shift towards a more formal appearance, potentially indicating a strategic move in diplomatic relations.
