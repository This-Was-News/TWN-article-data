## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine met with President Trump and European leaders at the White House to discuss Ukraine's interests amid Trump's push for a quick peace agreement with Russia, which would require Ukraine to make significant concessions. The meeting, which included leaders from Germany, France, Italy, and Finland, aimed to address the war despite disagreements over the path forward. Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin during the meeting, though the details of their conversation were unclear. Zelensky, dressed in a black suit instead of his usual military attire, discussed security guarantees for Ukraine but faced the difficult choice of surrendering territory or risking Trump's anger. European leaders pressed for a cease-fire, while Trump remained non-committal on specific security measures. The meeting ended with vague promises of a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and Putin, though Russia rejected the idea of NATO troops in Ukraine. The leaders also discussed the treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war and the possibility of a prisoner exchange. Despite the discussions, the path to peace remains uncertain, with Zelensky steadfastly rejecting territorial concessions and Trump's alignment with Russia increasing pressure on Ukraine to secure a better deal.
