## Article summary
A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research reveals that providing $1,000 unconditionally to low-income households in rural Kenya significantly improved infant and child survival rates. Infants born to recipients were nearly half as likely to die compared to those in non-recipient households, with a 45% reduction in child mortality under five years old. The study, conducted by GiveDirectly, involved over 10,000 households and found that cash transfers led to a 48% drop in infant mortality and a 70% reduction in deaths during and shortly after birth. The cash enabled better access to healthcare, particularly for families living within 30 minutes of a health facility, and increased hospital deliveries by 45%. Additionally, children in cash-recipient households were 44% less likely to go to bed hungry, and pregnant women worked fewer hours, benefiting both maternal and infant health. The study underscores the importance of combining cash transfers with accessible healthcare to reduce infant mortality effectively.
