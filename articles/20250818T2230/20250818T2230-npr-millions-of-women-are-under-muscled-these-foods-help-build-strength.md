## Article summary
The web page discusses the importance of muscle strength, particularly for women, who are often 'under-muscled.' Muscle mass declines after our 30s, leading to sarcopenia, which affects over 45% of older Americans. Loss of strength increases the risk of falls, a leading cause of injury in older adults. To combat this, resistance training and adequate protein intake are crucial. Many older women in the U.S. do not consume enough protein, which is essential for building and maintaining muscle. The recommended protein intake is at least 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, but experts suggest more for those who are actively training. The article provides tips and food examples to help increase protein intake, such as Greek yogurt, eggs, fish, nuts, seeds, and plant-based proteins like lentils and tofu. It also highlights the benefits of incorporating these protein-rich foods into daily meals.
