## Article summary
The U.S. capital is in its second week of heightened security with National Guard troops and federal agents patrolling the streets, following President Trump's deployment of additional law enforcement. Trump has defended his actions, despite critics arguing that his crackdown is based on false claims about crime rates in Washington, D.C. While Trump portrays the move as a necessary measure to combat crime, experts like Rosa Brooks, a former D.C. police officer, describe it as a 'police state' tactic. Despite a significant decline in crime and homelessness in recent years, Trump's administration insists on maintaining a strong federal presence. The White House claims over 300 criminals have been arrested, but there is no clear exit strategy for the military surge. Local leaders, including D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, have challenged the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, successfully blocking attempts to replace the police chief with a federal official. Republican governors from Ohio, South Carolina, and West Virginia have pledged to send more National Guard troops, some of whom may be armed. Community leaders and activists are working to prevent escalation and maintain calm, drawing lessons from past conflicts between law enforcement and residents. Mayor Muriel Bowser has acknowledged the anxiety among D.C. residents and urged unity as the city navigates this crisis.
