## Article summary
A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration's Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from investigating Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog group. The judge ruled that the FTC's probe, ostensibly about an advertiser boycott concerning social media platforms, violates Media Matters' freedom of speech. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan expressed concern over government retaliation against organizations engaged in constitutionally protected public debate. Media Matters has also been defending itself against a lawsuit by Elon Musk following a November 2023 story about antisemitic and offensive content appearing next to advertisements on X (formerly Twitter). The injunction was granted because Media Matters is likely to succeed in its claim that the FTC is being used to retaliate against them for a critical article on a Trump supporter. Media Matters' president, Angelo Carusone, emphasized the importance of fighting back against intimidation from the Trump administration. The FTC has not yet commented on the ruling.
