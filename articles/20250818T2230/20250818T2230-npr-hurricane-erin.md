## Article summary
Hurricane Erin, a major Category 4 storm with winds near 140 mph, is moving toward the Bahamas and the U.S. East Coast, bringing life-threatening surf and rip currents. While it's not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it poses significant flood risks, particularly to North Carolina's Outer Banks. Evacuation orders have been issued for visitors and residents of Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands due to potential flooding and impassable roads. The storm is currently about 140 miles north of Grand Turk Island and is expanding, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 80 miles from its center. It has already caused heavy rain and flooding in Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands. As Erin moves north, it threatens Bermuda and Canada, and could bring dangerous waves and rip currents along the U.S. eastern coastline from Florida to Massachusetts. The storm has weakened slightly since rapidly intensifying to a Category 5 over the weekend, but is expected to grow larger and potentially more impactful as it approaches the U.S. Climate change is contributing to the increasing power of hurricanes, with warmer ocean temperatures fueling these storms and raising the risk of flooding. Erin is the first Atlantic hurricane of the season, following a relatively slow start to the 2025 season.
