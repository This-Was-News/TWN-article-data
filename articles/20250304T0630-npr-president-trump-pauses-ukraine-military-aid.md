## Article summary
President Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine following a contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The decision to halt aid comes as the Trump administration reviews its support to ensure it aligns with peace efforts. During the meeting, tensions escalated as Trump accused Zelenskyy of "gambling with World War III" and disrespecting the U.S. Zelenskyy was seeking security guarantees from the U.S. to prevent further Russian territorial gains, a commitment Trump has been hesitant to make. The pause in aid coincides with Trump’s upcoming address to Congress and ongoing European efforts to establish a coalition supporting Ukraine. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer noted that Zelenskyy agreed to collaborate on a ceasefire plan with the UK and France. The situation reflects broader geopolitical complexities as Ukraine continues to navigate its conflict with Russia. European leaders, except Hungary, largely backed Zelenskyy after the meeting. This development adds another layer to the ongoing saga of U.S.-Ukraine relations amidst the war.
