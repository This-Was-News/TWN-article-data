## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's first 100 days of his second term, highlighting his intense drive to transform America and seek retribution against perceived enemies. Prominently displayed in the Oval Office are images symbolizing his struggles, including a mug shot from his arrest and a painting depicting him defiantly after an assassination attempt. Trump has aggressively pursued a wide-ranging agenda, dismantling government structures, enforcing strict immigration policies, and exerting executive power to implement changes without significant legislative support. His actions have sparked controversy, with critics warning of potential harm to democratic institutions and the economy. Despite his fervent efforts, he faces low public approval ratings, finishing this period with the least support of any president in polling history. While he aims to reshape the nation, many Americans describe his presidency as chaotic and alarming. Trump's administration is characterized by a lack of major legislation passed, relying heavily on executive orders instead. His approach has drawn both fervent support and fierce opposition, and he continues to push forward with his agenda, viewing himself as a pivotal historical figure. As he looks to the future, Trump's actions are poised to leave a lasting impact on the country.
