## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens, is poised to win the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, bolstered by high turnout in gentrifying neighborhoods and strong support from Asian and Hispanic communities. The 33-year-old democratic socialist garnered significant votes in affluent Brooklyn areas and diverse neighborhoods in Upper Manhattan, as well as regions with large South Asian populations. His main competitor, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, aimed to replicate Mayor Eric Adams' 2021 coalition but struggled in some key demographics, particularly among Black and Hispanic voters. While Cuomo maintained strong support in predominantly Black areas and among low-income residents, he performed well in affluent Manhattan neighborhoods where Mamdani faced challenges. 

Mamdani's appeal was particularly strong among college graduates and middle-to-higher income voters, winning substantial margins in neighborhoods like Ridgewood and Jamaica Hills. Cuomo successfully attracted Orthodox Jewish voters in areas like Borough Park, which contributed to his overall performance. Brad Lander, the city comptroller, placed third but could still impact the outcome due to his endorsement of Mamdani. The ranked-choice voting system allows for strategic voting, potentially benefiting Mamdani as he may receive transferred votes from Lander's supporters. If he wins the primary, Mamdani will face a competitive general election in November against incumbent Eric Adams, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and possibly Cuomo running as a third-party candidate.
