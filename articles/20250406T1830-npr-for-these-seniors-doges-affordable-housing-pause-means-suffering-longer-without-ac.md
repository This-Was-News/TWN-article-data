## Article summary
The Trump administration's decision to pause funding for a program aimed at upgrading aging affordable housing has left many seniors, particularly those at Trinity Woods in Emporia, Virginia, suffering without air conditioning. For three years, residents like Linda Morgan have struggled to cope with extreme heat, relying on fans and portable coolers since the building's central AC system failed. Although Trinity Woods was awarded $5.4 million for a new heating and cooling system, the funding freeze has jeopardized these plans. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) claims the program is under review, but residents and housing advocates express frustration over the lack of communication and clarity regarding the funding pause. 

The halted program was part of a broader initiative to improve energy efficiency in affordable housing, which is critical for many low-income residents, particularly those with health issues. The lack of central AC exacerbates living conditions, causing residents to avoid social gatherings and impacting their well-being. Advocates argue that preserving existing affordable housing is essential, especially in rural areas where options are limited. With only a small fraction of properties likely to receive funding, the future of many projects remains uncertain, leaving residents in a precarious situation as they await a resolution.
