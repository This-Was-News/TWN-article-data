## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV, the first American-born pope, has taken a centrist approach while maintaining some progressive views similar to his predecessor, Pope Francis. His emphasis on inclusivity is evident in his commitment to welcoming diverse voices within the Church. However, he opposes the ordination of female deacons, aligning with traditional Catholic doctrines, while still advocating for increased women's visibility in church leadership. On LGBTQ+ issues, Leo has expressed concerns about Western culture's acceptance of same-sex relationships and has been ambiguous regarding the Vatican's stance on same-sex blessings. He is a strong advocate for addressing climate change, urging the Church to transition from rhetoric to action and emphasizing a respectful relationship with nature. Leo has also shown compassion for migrants, particularly Venezuelans in Peru, and has criticized harsh immigration policies in the U.S. Politically, he has voted in Republican primaries but has also voiced opposition to certain Trump administration policies, including family separation and immigration deportations. His social media presence reflects a commitment to social justice, including anti-racism and support for vaccination during the pandemic. Overall, Leo XIV's papacy may continue to navigate the balance between tradition and modernity in the Catholic Church.
