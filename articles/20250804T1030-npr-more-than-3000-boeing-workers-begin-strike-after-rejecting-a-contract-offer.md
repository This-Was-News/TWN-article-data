## Article summary
More than 3,000 Boeing workers at facilities in Missouri and Illinois began a strike after rejecting a contract offer. The workers, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837, started the strike due to a lack of respect and dignity in the offered contract. The strike involves workers who build fighter jets and other defense systems, including F-15 and F/A-18 aircraft. Boeing expressed disappointment, noting the rejected offer included a 40% average wage increase and addressed concerns about alternative work schedules. The company stated it is prepared for the strike and has implemented contingency plans to maintain operations.
