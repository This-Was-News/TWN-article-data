## Article summary
Seasonal employees at Yosemite National Park worked for up to six weeks without pay this spring and summer due to federal hiring delays and budget cuts. Some workers felt exploited, as they volunteered for weeks before being officially hired and paid. Yosemite relies heavily on seasonal workers for various roles, but staffing issues in 2025 led to significant delays in hiring. The park offered some prospective workers the option to volunteer while waiting for federal onboarding, with some agreeing to this arrangement. Workers who volunteered were often assigned to different roles than their originally committed positions and were not paid for their volunteer work, leading to feelings of unfairness. The park's staffing struggles are part of a broader issue across national parks, with significant staffing declines and hiring challenges.
