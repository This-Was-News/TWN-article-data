## Article summary
The article discusses the Trump administration's significant changes to the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.), which includes proposed budget cuts and layoffs potentially reducing the workforce by 50%. Recent hires, including experienced tax professionals like Beth Crowell, faced layoffs that hindered ongoing audits of major corporations, jeopardizing the agency's ability to enforce tax laws and collect revenue. The administration's goal appears to be transforming the I.R.S. into a more politically aligned entity, with Trump appointing Billy Long, a former congressman with limited experience, to lead the agency. Elon Musk's influence is notable, as his team aims to automate I.R.S. functions and streamline operations, while concerns grow about the potential misuse of taxpayer information for political purposes. The article highlights the struggles of employees facing layoffs and the chaotic management within the agency. The I.R.S. has historically faced unpopularity, making it a target for anti-government initiatives, which could ultimately lead to decreased tax revenue. Amidst these changes, the agency's modernization efforts are at risk, as the new leadership prioritizes cuts over rebuilding capacity. Overall, the future of the I.R.S. remains uncertain as it navigates these drastic transformations under the Trump administration.
