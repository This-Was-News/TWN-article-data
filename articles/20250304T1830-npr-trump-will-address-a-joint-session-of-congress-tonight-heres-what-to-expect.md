## Article summary
President Trump is set to address a joint session of Congress tonight at 9 PM ET, marking his first such address since returning to the White House. The speech is expected to cover a range of topics including immigration, tariffs, and U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump has signed numerous executive orders aimed at reducing the federal workforce and addressing illegal immigration, which he will likely discuss as he seeks funding from Congress for his agenda. 

The address comes amid rising tensions with major trading partners due to new tariffs imposed by the U.S., leading to retaliatory actions that could raise consumer costs. Additionally, Trump plans to touch on a potential agreement with Ukraine regarding critical minerals. Following his speech, Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin will deliver the party's rebuttal. 

The event will include live coverage and analysis from NPR, providing insights into both Trump's remarks and the Democratic response. As the speech unfolds, it will be closely monitored for its implications on domestic and foreign policy.
