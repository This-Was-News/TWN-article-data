## Article summary
Sen. Amy Klobuchar criticizes President Trump's economic policies, particularly his tariffs and firing of a senior Labor official, emphasizing Congress's role as a check on the president. She highlights the slowing job growth, rising inflation, and decreased economic growth, questioning Trump's aggressive policies like tariffs and mass deportations. Klobuchar argues that while tariffs bring short-term revenue, they harm the economy long-term, citing job losses, market fluctuations, and increased costs for consumers. She notes bipartisan concern about tariffs but laments that Republicans still support Trump's actions. Klobuchar advocates for Congress to reassert its power, the courts to challenge Trump's policies, and the public to demand change.
