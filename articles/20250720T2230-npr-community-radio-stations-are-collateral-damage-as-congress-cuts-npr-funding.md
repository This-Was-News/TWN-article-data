## Article summary
The web page discusses the impact of Congress' decision to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media, which has significantly affected small radio operations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, a cooperative of three stations serving rural communities in West Virginia and Virginia. Allegheny Mountain Radio, which relies on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for up to 65% of its budget, provides local news, information, and a mix of music programs to areas with limited internet and cell phone access. The cuts threaten the station's financial stability, potentially leading to staff reductions or station closures, despite its crucial role in delivering local news and community information. Local officials and residents, including Monterey's mayor, emphasize the station's importance in disseminating timely information about emergencies and community events. The funding cuts are seen as collateral damage in a politically charged environment, with some listeners criticizing the station for airing NPR's newscast, which they perceive as politically biased.
