## Article summary
Haiti's iconic Hotel Oloffson, a 19th-century gingerbread mansion in Port-au-Prince, has been destroyed by gang violence. The hotel, once a cultural hub hosting luminaries like Mick Jagger and Jackie Kennedy Onassis, was immortalized in Graham Greene's novel *The Comedians*. Built in the 1880s, it served as a presidential residence and a U.S. Marine Corps hospital before becoming a hotel. Richard Morse, the hotel's long-term manager and frontman of the band RAM, described it as a heartbeat of Haitian culture. Despite the destruction, Morse remains hopeful about the resilience of Haiti and its people, emphasizing that the spirit of the Oloffson and Haiti endures.
