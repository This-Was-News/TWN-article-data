## Article summary
Wall Street is experiencing turmoil following a chaotic rollout of tariffs by President Trump, which resulted in a significant market decline, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis. Investors are grappling with anger, anxiety, and frustration as they assess the impact of the tariffs on their portfolios and the broader economy. Major banks are preparing for potential client failures and have begun implementing margin calls, while hedge funds are reporting substantial losses. Unlike past crises, the financial sector lacks confidence in government intervention to stabilize the situation. Some Wall Street figures express concern over the uncertain economic outlook, with predictions of a potential recession if tariffs remain in place. Despite the panic, some executives noted that trading operations have continued smoothly without major glitches. The overall sentiment remains cautious, as many companies are hesitant to discuss their future prospects amidst such volatility. As the market adjusts, the true extent of the damage from the tariffs is yet to be fully understood, with ongoing discussions about potential agreements to alleviate the situation.
