## Article summary
Iran's leaders are leveraging nationalist sentiment following recent attacks by Israel and the U.S. to unite the country amid economic and political challenges. This has led to a fusion of Shiite identity and Iranian nationalism, with patriotic symbols and ancient folklore being embraced by the government. The effectiveness of this nationalist fervor is debated, with some Iranians viewing it as a genuine expression of patriotism, while others see it as a government-driven tactic. The war has temporarily stifled domestic dissent, with many Iranians reluctant to protest due to foreign involvement. However, the long-term impact of this nationalist surge remains uncertain, especially given Iran's ongoing economic struggles.
