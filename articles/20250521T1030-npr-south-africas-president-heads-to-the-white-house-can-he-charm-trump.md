## Article summary
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is meeting with Donald Trump at the White House to address strained relations between the two countries. The U.S. administration has criticized South Africa for alleged persecution of white Afrikaner farmers, which the South African government disputes. Tensions have escalated, with Trump cutting aid and expelling South Africa's ambassador. Ramaphosa aims to clarify misconceptions about race relations in South Africa and the false narrative of a "white genocide." 

As a seasoned diplomat, Ramaphosa previously attempted to charm Trump by inviting him to play golf at the G20 summit. The South African leader expressed frustration over the U.S. granting refugee status to Afrikaners, arguing that they left due to a desire to avoid living under Black majority rule. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, a South African-born adviser to Trump, has criticized the government's policies affecting business operations. The South African delegation is focused on securing trade relations, emphasizing the importance of preferential trade agreements. Public sentiment in South Africa is mixed, with many hoping for a positive outcome while recognizing the challenges ahead. Ultimately, Ramaphosa's strategy may involve finding common ground with Trump to strengthen bilateral ties.
