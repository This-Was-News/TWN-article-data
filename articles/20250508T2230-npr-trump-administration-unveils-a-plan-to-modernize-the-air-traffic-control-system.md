## Article summary
The Trump administration, led by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, has unveiled a comprehensive plan to modernize the outdated U.S. air traffic control system within four years. The estimated cost of the initiative exceeds $12.5 billion, with industry experts suggesting it could require at least $18.5 billion in additional funding. The plan aims to replace aging telecommunications and surveillance systems that currently rely on outdated technology with modern solutions, including new radar sensors and air traffic control towers. This announcement follows significant disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, highlighting the urgent need for upgrades. Duffy emphasized the importance of immediate action, stating that the plan requires upfront funding from Congress rather than incremental support. Airline executives have expressed strong support for the modernization efforts, citing safety concerns and the need to avoid further delays. Critics have raised skepticism about the feasibility of the proposed upgrades, noting a history of unfulfilled promises in air traffic control improvements. The plan also includes a recruitment initiative to address staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, although staffing is not a central focus of the modernization proposal. Overall, the administration's commitment to enhancing air traffic safety and efficiency comes amid ongoing challenges within the aviation sector.
