## Article summary
Stocks surged after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, leading to the S&P 500's largest single-day gain since October 2008. This decision, made in response to market turmoil, provided temporary relief to investors, although tariffs on China were raised to 125 percent, leaving many American importers still vulnerable. The White House framed the tariff pause as part of a strategic plan, despite previous assertions from Trump that his policies would remain unchanged. The markets reacted positively, but the S&P 500 remained significantly below its February peak. Amidst the chaos, economists expressed concerns about potential recession risks, with some arguing that high tariffs could stifle growth and increase prices for consumers. In Europe, counter-tariffs against the U.S. were approved, signaling escalating trade tensions. Companies, particularly in Asia, found themselves reassessing their supply chains, with some opting to remain in China due to its manufacturing advantages. Walmart acknowledged increased uncertainty due to tariffs, complicating its financial outlook. Overall, while the pause provided a momentary boost to markets, uncertainty surrounding trade policies persists, leaving investors and businesses in a state of flux.
