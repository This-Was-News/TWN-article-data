## Article summary
Following a recent incident where a reporter was inadvertently included in a sensitive Signal chat regarding military operations, the Pentagon issued a warning about the messaging app being targeted by hackers. The advisory, dated March 18, cautioned against using Signal for any unclassified information due to identified vulnerabilities exploited by Russian hacking groups. It emphasized that while Signal can be used for unclassified exercises, it is not approved for processing or storing sensitive information. 

The memo highlighted concerns over phishing attacks aimed at Signal users, prompting the app to implement additional safeguards. A previous Pentagon memo from 2023 also restricted the use of mobile applications for controlled unclassified information. The incident raised alarms about the sharing of sensitive military intelligence in unsecured forums, with experts criticizing the lack of caution among high-level officials. 

The situation underscores the risks associated with using third-party messaging applications in national security contexts. The Pentagon's warning serves as a reminder of the importance of secure communication channels in safeguarding sensitive information.
