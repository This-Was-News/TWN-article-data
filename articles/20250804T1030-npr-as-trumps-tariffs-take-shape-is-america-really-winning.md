## Article summary
President Trump's sweeping tariffs, intended to make America "great" and "rich," are causing global uncertainty and economic slowdown. Inflation is rising, the labor market is cooling, and GDP growth has slowed, with experts predicting further economic weakening. The average American household is expected to bear a cost of $2,400 due to tariffs, with significant impacts on clothing and textiles. While tariffs are generating revenue, Trump's other policies, like tax cuts, are increasing national debt, potentially offsetting the benefits. Globally, tariffs are disrupting trade, with countries like China redirecting exports, and the U.S. facing long-term consequences, including eroded trust and potential retaliation.
