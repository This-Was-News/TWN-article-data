## Article summary
The article discusses the growing dilemma faced by undocumented immigrants in the U.S. as they consider self-deportation amid heightened immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. Many families, like that of a woman identified as "S.," are contemplating returning to their home countries, such as El Salvador, to ensure their U.S.-born children can return in the future. The Trump administration's multimillion-dollar ad campaign encourages self-deportation, presenting it as a way to avoid harsher consequences, including deportation and permanent bans from reentry. 

Despite these promotions, many immigrants feel the pressure of deteriorating living conditions in the U.S., leading to fear and anxiety, particularly among children. The article highlights the emotional toll this uncertainty has taken on families, with some parents arguing over the decision to stay or leave. Experts warn that the administration's policies are making life increasingly difficult for undocumented immigrants, impacting not only their well-being but also that of their U.S. citizen children. 

While some families are taking steps to secure passports for their children in anticipation of potential self-deportation, skepticism remains about the government's assurances regarding future reentry. Overall, the article illustrates the complex and painful choices facing immigrant families amid a climate of fear and uncertainty.
