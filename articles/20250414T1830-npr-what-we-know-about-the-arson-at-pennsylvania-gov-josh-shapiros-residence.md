## Article summary
Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson, and other crimes for setting fire to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence while the family was inside. Balmer turned himself in to police following the incident, which occurred early Sunday morning. Authorities report that he expressed hatred towards Shapiro and indicated he would have harmed him if encountered. The arson involved Balmer breaking windows and throwing incendiary devices into the home, causing significant damage. He was caught on surveillance video during the crime and later confessed to a woman about his actions. Balmer created the incendiary devices using gasoline-filled beer bottles and was found with items matching those seen in the footage. He is currently under police supervision in a hospital and will be transferred to Dauphin County Prison for arraignment. The FBI is also involved in the investigation, and Balmer may face both state and federal charges. Governor Shapiro condemned the violence, calling for an end to political aggression, and received support from various political leaders.
