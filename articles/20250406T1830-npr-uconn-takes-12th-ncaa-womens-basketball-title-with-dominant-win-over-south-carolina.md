## Article summary
UConn has claimed its 12th NCAA women's basketball title with a commanding 82-59 victory over defending champions South Carolina. The win, achieved on April 6, 2025, marked the Huskies' first championship since 2016, ending a nine-year title drought. Star players Azzi Fudd and Sarah Strong each contributed 24 points, while Paige Bueckers added 17 points in her final game with the team. UConn led throughout the game, extending their advantage significantly in the third quarter, where Fudd, Strong, and Bueckers combined for 23 of the team's 26 points. This victory is particularly significant for Bueckers, who has faced multiple injuries during her career but finally secured a championship. Coach Geno Auriemma celebrated this win, which adds to his legacy, as UConn had previously been eliminated in heartbreaking fashion during their title drought. South Carolina aimed for their third title in four years but fell short against the dominant Huskies. The game started fast, with both teams exchanging early baskets before UConn pulled ahead. UConn's strong performance reestablishes their position at the pinnacle of women's basketball.
