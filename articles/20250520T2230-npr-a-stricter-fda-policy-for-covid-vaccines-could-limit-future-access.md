## Article summary
The FDA is implementing a new strategy for evaluating COVID-19 vaccines that prioritizes immunizations for high-risk individuals, specifically those aged 65 and older and younger people with health issues. This approach requires vaccine manufacturers to conduct large studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for children and healthy younger adults, potentially limiting access for many. The FDA aims to align U.S. policies with those of other high-income countries and restore public trust in vaccines. Under the new guidelines, annual boosters may not be universally recommended, affecting an estimated 100 to 200 million Americans who would be eligible for vaccines, a shift from the current inclusive approach. While some public health experts welcome the clarity of these guidelines, critics argue that the new requirements could mislead the public regarding vaccine safety and limit availability, especially if insurers stop covering vaccinations for everyone. Concerns are raised about the potential exclusion of younger individuals who may still face risks like long COVID. Experts emphasize the ethical implications of requiring placebo-controlled studies when effective vaccines are available. The FDA's new policy reflects a balance of regulatory flexibility and a demand for robust data on low-risk individuals. An advisory committee is set to meet to discuss future COVID booster compositions.
