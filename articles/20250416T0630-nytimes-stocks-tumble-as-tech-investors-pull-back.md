## Article summary
Stock markets experienced a decline as concerns grew over the impact of the global trade war on major technology companies. Nvidia announced that U.S. government restrictions on chip sales to China would result in a $5.5 billion loss, causing its shares to drop 6% in after-hours trading. In Europe, ASML's shares fell over 6% due to disappointing orders, with its CEO attributing the decline to uncertainty stemming from U.S. tariffs. The Stoxx Europe 600 index and stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan also reported losses, reflecting the widespread impact on the tech sector. 

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, a key player in chip production, saw its shares decrease by 2.5%. In the U.S., S&P 500 futures were down more than 1%, following a slight dip in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq the previous day. Despite some positive earnings from banks and progress on a trade deal with Britain, investor sentiment remains shaky due to President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. A Bank of America survey indicated that global investors have significantly reduced their U.S. stock holdings, citing fears of a recession linked to the trade war. Overall, the uncertainty surrounding trade relations continues to weigh heavily on market performance.
