## Article summary
Israel launched air strikes against Iran early on June 13, 2025, targeting its nuclear program and missile sites, which resulted in retaliatory strikes from Tehran. The Israeli attacks reportedly killed key Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists just before planned negotiations in Oman regarding Iran's uranium enrichment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the primary target was the Natanz nuclear facility. 

Following the initial strikes, Israel conducted a significant operation against Iranian air defenses, destroying numerous radars and missile launchers. Jordan reported intercepting missiles and drones aimed at its territory, while air raid sirens prompted shelter-seeking among its citizens. In response to the escalating conflict, several countries, including Jordan, Israel, Iraq, and Iran, closed their airspace to civilian traffic, leading to flight cancellations in the Arab Gulf region.

The situation caused a surge in oil prices, reflecting the heightened tensions. Netanyahu framed the attacks as essential for Israel's survival amid growing concerns over Iran's nuclear advancements. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Iran's non-compliance with nuclear non-proliferation agreements, while Iran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The U.S. condemned the potential for an Iranian nuclear weapons program but clarified its non-involvement in the Israeli military actions.
