## Article summary
The article discusses the potential role of fentanyl in easing the trade deadlock between China and the United States. Initially, China banned all variants of fentanyl in 2019 to gain favor with then-President Trump, who had accused China of insufficient action against the drug. As trade tensions escalated, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, citing fentanyl as a major factor. Currently, both nations are exploring ways to de-escalate the situation, with China considering a renewed offer to cooperate on fentanyl, which could involve sending its top security official to Washington. This cooperation might facilitate simultaneous tariff reductions, allowing both sides to save face. China has previously resisted pressure tied to tariffs, asserting that the U.S. should address its own social issues instead of blaming China for the fentanyl crisis. The article highlights that cooperation on fentanyl had stalled in 2022 but resumed after a summit between Xi and Biden in November 2023. Despite China's efforts to regulate precursor chemicals, enforcement remains challenging due to the adaptability of producers. The situation reflects a complex interplay of trade, diplomacy, and public health concerns.
