## Article summary
Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, found himself inadvertently included in a group chat on Signal with U.S. national security leaders discussing imminent military strikes on Yemen. The chat, which began on March 11, included high-ranking officials such as Vice President JD Vance and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz. Goldberg expressed disbelief over the security breach, noting he had not been vetted before being added to the discussion, where sensitive operational military information was shared. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes confirmed the authenticity of the message thread and stated they are reviewing how Goldberg was added.

President Trump claimed ignorance of the incident, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth dismissed the notion that war plans were being shared. The breach has raised serious concerns among national security experts, with former officials criticizing the use of an unsecured app for such discussions. Democrats in Congress have also condemned the incident, calling for investigations and accountability for those involved. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries labeled the leak "outrageous," while Rep. Eric Swalwell demanded disciplinary action for those on the message chain. The incident has highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the handling of sensitive national security communications.
