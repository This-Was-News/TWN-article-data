## Article summary
In response to the passage of a controversial congressional redistricting bill, at least 51 Texas House Democrats broke quorum by leaving the state, preventing the House from conducting business. The bill, which Democrats argue is a racially motivated gerrymander, was passed by a Republican-led committee and aims to redraw congressional maps to favor the GOP. Democrats, led by House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu, criticized Governor Greg Abbott and other Republicans for prioritizing redistricting over flood relief efforts in Central Texas. Republicans, including Attorney General Ken Paxton and Governor Abbott, have called for the Democrats' arrest and expulsion from office, with Abbott threatening to remove them from their positions if they do not return by a specified deadline. The last time Texas Democrats broke quorum was four years ago to block election legislation, ultimately leading to the collapse of the quorum break.
