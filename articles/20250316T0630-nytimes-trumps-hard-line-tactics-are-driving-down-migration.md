## Article summary
The New York Times article discusses how President Trump's hardline immigration policies are significantly reducing migration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in decades, with many migrants returning home instead of heading north. Building on the restrictions initiated by President Biden, Trump has implemented measures such as halting asylum indefinitely, deploying military forces, and pressuring Latin American governments to curb migration.

Statistics show a steep decline in migrant apprehensions, with only 8,347 apprehensions reported in February 2025, a stark contrast to over 225,000 in December 2023. This decline is also evident in the Darién Gap, where crossings have sharply decreased. Trump's approach has garnered support from those advocating for tougher immigration restrictions, as political sentiment shifts in the U.S. toward stricter measures.

However, experts caution that the current lull in migration could be temporary, and economic conditions worsened by sanctions and tariffs might lead to future surges. Many migrants in Mexico are reconsidering their plans, with a notable number seeking assistance to return home. The article highlights the complex dynamics of migration and the potential long-term consequences of Trump's policies.
