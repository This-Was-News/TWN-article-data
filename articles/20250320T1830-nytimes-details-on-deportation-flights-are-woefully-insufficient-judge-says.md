## Article summary
A federal judge, James E. Boasberg, expressed frustration with the Trump administration regarding deportation flights of Venezuelan immigrants, indicating that the government's explanations were inadequate. He ordered the administration to clarify why they allowed two flights to El Salvador despite a ruling pausing such deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The Justice Department has been accused of evading compliance and providing insufficient information on the flights. Boasberg's order reflects concerns over the administration's use of wartime powers and the potential for a constitutional crisis if the administration disregards judicial authority. 

Lawyers representing the deported individuals argue that many are not gang members, as claimed by the government, and that their tattoos do not necessarily indicate gang affiliation. The Alien Enemies Act has been rarely invoked in U.S. history, raising questions about its current application. The administration maintains that the deportees are part of a violent gang aligned with the Venezuelan government, framing their arrival as an invasion. As tensions rise, the Justice Department seeks to reverse the judge's order, while the judge demands more transparency and compliance from the government. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for presidential powers and judicial oversight.
