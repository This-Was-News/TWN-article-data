## Article summary
The CDC is considering a recommendation to use only flu shots without thimerosal, a preservative containing mercury, which has been largely absent from flu vaccines for nearly two decades. Thimerosal, used to prevent contamination in multi-dose vials, has faced scrutiny despite having a long history of safe use. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recently voted to recommend thimerosal-free vaccines for children, pregnant women, and adults, although one member expressed concerns over prioritizing this issue over more pressing health risks related to influenza. 

Thimerosal's link to autism has been widely discredited, with numerous studies confirming no association between the preservative and the disorder. Most flu vaccines are now administered in single-dose syringes, meaning that a potential ban on thimerosal may not significantly impact the public. However, health centers may face challenges in transitioning to thimerosal-free vaccines as they prepare for the upcoming flu season. The committee's decision-making process raises concerns about adherence to scientific evidence and could undermine public confidence in vaccines. Experts warn that difficulties in accessing vaccines may ultimately harm public health.
