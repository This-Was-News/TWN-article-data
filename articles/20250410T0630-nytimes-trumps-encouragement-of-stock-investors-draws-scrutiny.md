## Article summary
President Trump stirred controversy by advising stock investors to remain calm and consider buying stocks amidst his tariff announcements. His suggestion coincided with a significant market surge after he decided to pause tariffs for 90 days, prompting questions from Democrats and ethics experts about potential market manipulation. Critics, including Representative Mike Levin, argued that Trump's statements could have led to unfair advantages for his supporters while disadvantaging cautious investors. In response, White House officials maintained that Trump's comments were intended to reassure the public and were not indicative of market manipulation. Senator Adam B. Schiff expressed concerns about the potential for insider trading and called for an investigation into who might have benefited from the timing of Trump's announcement. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert, noted that such actions would typically trigger scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC declined to comment on the situation, leaving questions about the legality of Trump's actions unanswered. Overall, the incident highlights ongoing tensions between political actions and market responses, as well as concerns about transparency and fairness in trading practices.
