## Article summary
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has informed over 400 laid-off Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees that their layoffs have been revoked, potentially reinstating key personnel in crucial health divisions. This decision follows mass layoffs that occurred on April 1, affecting thousands of workers across the agency. Among those expected to return are 214 employees from the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, as well as more than 150 from the National Center for Environmental Health. The email notification did not clarify the reasons behind the reversal, leaving many employees confused and uncertain about their future. Some expressed hope but also concern regarding the instability caused by the previous layoffs, which had already disrupted public health efforts. Experts acknowledged the importance of these workers for public health, while also noting that many others remain without jobs. The reinstatement raises logistical challenges for those who have since relocated or accepted other positions. Overall, while the news is seen as a positive step, it highlights ongoing issues within the CDC and the public health sector.
