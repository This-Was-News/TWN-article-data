## Article summary
The military parade celebrating the Army's 250th birthday coincides with the deployment of National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles, raising concerns among military officials and experts. Critics argue that this juxtaposition could imply the military's support for a crackdown on American citizens, undermining its role as a symbol of national unity. Former defense officials express alarm over the escalation of military presence in response to protests, with some veterans groups refusing to participate in the parade due to its perceived political implications. President Trump's legal basis for deploying troops is questioned, particularly regarding the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits active-duty military involvement in domestic law enforcement. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supports the deployment, framing it as a necessary enforcement of immigration law. Lawmakers express concern over the militarization of domestic issues, emphasizing that active-duty troops are not trained for policing roles. The situation reflects broader fears about the military's politicization amidst a polarized political climate. Experts caution that the military's involvement in political matters could damage its relationship with the public. Overall, the events highlight the tension between military celebrations and the implications of their use in domestic situations.
