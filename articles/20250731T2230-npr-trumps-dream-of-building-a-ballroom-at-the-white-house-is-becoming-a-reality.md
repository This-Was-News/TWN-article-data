## Article summary
President Trump's long-standing dream of building a ballroom at the White House is becoming a reality, with construction set to begin in September. The new ballroom, costing $200 million, will be approximately 90,000 square feet and seat 650 guests, addressing the need for larger event spaces. Funded by Trump and other donors, the ballroom will replace the East Wing, displacing current offices, and is expected to be completed before the end of Trump's term. Trump has been involved in detailed planning meetings with various White House offices and services, emphasizing his commitment to the project. This initiative is part of Trump's broader efforts to leave a lasting mark on the White House, following other recent renovations and additions.
