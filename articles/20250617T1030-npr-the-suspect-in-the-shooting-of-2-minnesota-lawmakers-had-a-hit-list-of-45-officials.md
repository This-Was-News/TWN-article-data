## Article summary
Vance Boelter, 57, has been arrested in connection with the shooting that resulted in the death of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and injured state Sen. John Hoffman. Authorities discovered that Boelter had a "hit list" of 45 Democratic officials, indicating a premeditated attack against lawmakers. He disguised himself as a police officer and used a black SUV with emergency lights while armed with a 9mm handgun and wearing tactical gear. The FBI confirmed that Boelter had been planning these attacks for several months, although a clear motive remains unknown. The violent incidents took place during a chaotic Saturday, with Boelter targeting multiple lawmakers' homes.

Minnesota officials described the shootings as an act of targeted political violence, with Governor Tim Walz condemning the attacks. The manhunt for Boelter involved extensive law enforcement efforts, culminating in his capture in a field after he fled from police. Both Hortman and Hoffman were on Boelter's hit list, which included other notable Democratic figures. The recent shootings highlight a disturbing trend of political violence in the U.S., with reports indicating that many lawmakers have faced threats in recent years. In response, former President Trump condemned the violence and emphasized that it would not be tolerated in the country.
