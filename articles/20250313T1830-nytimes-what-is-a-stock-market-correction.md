## Article summary
The article from The New York Times discusses stock market corrections, specifically highlighting a recent decline in the S&P 500, which fell 10.1% from its peak, indicating a shift in investor sentiment towards pessimism. A correction is defined as a drop of 10% or more in stock prices from recent highs, a threshold that serves as a signal of increased market caution. The article notes that this is the 13th correction for the S&P 500 since 2000, with some corrections leading to bear markets, defined as declines of at least 20%. 

The recent market downturn is attributed to investor concerns over President Trump's fluctuating stance on tariffs and the potential economic implications. While some corrections are brief, like the one in early 2018, others can lead to prolonged downturns or bear markets. The article also mentions that a previous bear market at the pandemic's onset was severe but short-lived, with stocks recovering quickly thereafter. Overall, the article emphasizes the unpredictability of market corrections and the varied durations and impacts they can have on stock prices.
