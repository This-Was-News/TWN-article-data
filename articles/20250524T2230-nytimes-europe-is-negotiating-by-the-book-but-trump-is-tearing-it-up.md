## Article summary
The European Union is struggling to negotiate effectively with the Trump administration, which is disregarding established trade protocols. President Trump has proposed a dramatic 50 percent tariff on European imports, citing unfair trade practices as justification. This move follows unsuccessful negotiations, where Europe approached discussions as allies while the U.S. viewed them as a chance to pressure a commercial rival. Trump has already imposed various tariffs on European goods and has indicated a preference for one-sided offers rather than mutual concessions. European officials have suggested win-win solutions, such as eliminating tariffs on industrial products, but these have not been well received. The U.S. administration is also pushing for changes in Europe's Value-Added Tax and food safety standards, which European negotiators deem unacceptable. Despite the EU's significant trading relationship with the U.S., officials feel their leverage is diminishing amid Trump's aggressive tactics. The EU has prepared countermeasures targeting American goods in response to potential tariffs. Analysts see Trump's tariff proposal as a negotiating tactic, but the outcome remains uncertain, with significant gaps between U.S. and EU expectations. If implemented, the proposed tariffs could severely impact the European economy.
