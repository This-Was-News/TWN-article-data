## Article summary
A Senate committee report released on Sunday criticized the U.S. Secret Service for "a cascade of preventable failures" that led to the assassination attempt on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally in Butler, Pa., last summer. The report highlighted communication breakdowns within the Secret Service and between the agency and other law enforcement, as well as organizational mistakes that obstructed the view of the shooter. The committee found that the Secret Service had denied some resources to Trump's detail during the 2024 presidential election and that former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle had falsely testified to Congress. The Secret Service has since implemented 21 of 46 recommended reforms and disciplined six employees, though no one has been fired. The agency's director, Sean Curran, stated that the Secret Service will continue to work cooperatively with the committee to address the failures.
