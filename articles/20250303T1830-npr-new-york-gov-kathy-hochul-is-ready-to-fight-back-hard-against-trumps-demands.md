## Article summary
New York Governor Kathy Hochul is prepared to "fight back hard" against President Trump's demands to dismantle the congestion pricing program implemented in New York City. This initiative aims to alleviate traffic congestion and fund transit infrastructure by charging a toll for vehicles entering central Manhattan during peak hours. Hochul emphasizes the need for Democratic governors to act as a "firewall" against the Republican agenda, particularly as it threatens social safety net programs. She expressed frustration over the federal administration's stance, which she believes undermines state authority in making local decisions. 

Hochul has been actively engaging in discussions with other governors to strategize against federal funding cuts, particularly to Medicaid, which she argues would harm vulnerable populations. She also highlighted the importance of litigation as a key strategy in resisting federal overreach, working closely with New York's Attorney General. Despite the challenges posed by a Republican-controlled federal government, Hochul remains committed to fighting for policies that benefit New Yorkers. She believes that elections in 2026 could shift the political landscape, offering hope for change. Overall, Hochul's resolve reflects a broader commitment among Democratic leaders to resist federal initiatives perceived as harmful to their constituents.
