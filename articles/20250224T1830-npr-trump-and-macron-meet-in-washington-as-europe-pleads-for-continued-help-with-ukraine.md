## Article summary
Trump and Macron met in Washington amid Europe's calls for ongoing support for Ukraine, coinciding with the third anniversary of Russia's invasion. During a joint press conference, Trump expressed his belief that it is in Putin's best interest to negotiate an end to the war, suggesting that a deal could be achieved soon. Macron praised Trump's collaboration with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy on a minerals agreement that would enhance security guarantees for Ukraine. Both leaders emphasized the importance of a peace deal that respects Ukrainian sovereignty and avoids a mere ceasefire without guarantees.

While Trump characterized Europe's aid to Ukraine as a loan, Macron sought to clarify the financial support provided. Trump predicted that once an agreement is reached, the conflict in Ukraine would cease, while Macron indicated that some European nations were prepared to send troops to ensure peace, albeit not in combat roles. The discussions highlighted their friendly rapport, despite differences in views on European support for Ukraine, with Macron emphasizing the need for a robust peace framework.
