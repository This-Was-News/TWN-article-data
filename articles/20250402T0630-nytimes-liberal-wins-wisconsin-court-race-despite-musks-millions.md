## Article summary
Susan Crawford, a liberal candidate, won a crucial seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, defeating conservative opponent Brad Schimel despite $25 million in campaign spending from Elon Musk. High voter turnout characterized the election, which became a referendum on Musk's influence and his alignment with Trump. Crawford's victory by approximately 9 points signals a significant momentum shift for Democrats, who previously faced challenges since Trump's return to the White House. The election's outcome may impact congressional control, with potential implications for redistricting in favor of Democrats. Musk's unprecedented financial involvement and personal campaigning did not yield the expected results, as his actions seemed to galvanize Democratic support against him. Crawford's win maintains a 4-to-3 liberal majority on the court, allowing for key decisions on abortion and labor rights in the coming months. The race was marked by Musk's attempts to frame it as pivotal for the future of democracy, although his focus strayed from the campaign's core issues. With Crawford's fundraising success and backing from prominent Democrats, the election has broader implications for the political landscape in Wisconsin and beyond.
