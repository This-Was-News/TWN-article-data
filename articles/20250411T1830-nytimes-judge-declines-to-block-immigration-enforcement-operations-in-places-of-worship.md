## Article summary
A federal judge has ruled against a coalition of Christian and Jewish groups seeking to block the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations in places of worship. Judge Dabney L. Friedrich determined that there was insufficient evidence to support claims that these religious spaces were being targeted for raids under the administration's mass deportation campaign. The judge noted that, while concerns were raised about the potential for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to conduct raids in churches, mosques, and synagogues, there were few indications that such actions were occurring. She emphasized the lack of clear directives or patterns of enforcement targeting these locations.

Despite acknowledging some arrests in churches this year, including one linked to a plaintiff, Judge Friedrich concluded that stronger evidence was necessary to prove that religious buildings were under surveillance or specifically targeted. The ruling does not end the case, but it casts doubt on the likelihood of the plaintiffs succeeding in their lawsuit. In contrast to the previous guidance from former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas, which prohibited arrests in sensitive locations, the Trump administration has allowed for more flexible enforcement. A separate ruling in Maryland temporarily halted raids in religious buildings, but it did not apply nationwide. Overall, the current evidence does not support a credible threat of imminent enforcement in these religious spaces.
