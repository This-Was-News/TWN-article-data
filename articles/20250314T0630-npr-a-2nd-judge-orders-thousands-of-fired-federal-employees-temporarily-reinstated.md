## Article summary
A federal judge in Maryland has temporarily ordered the reinstatement of thousands of federal employees fired by the Trump administration, ruling that the mass firings were conducted unlawfully without proper notification to the states. U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar issued a 14-day stay following a lawsuit by 20 Democratic attorneys general, highlighting that federal agencies failed to follow proper procedures, including the required 60 days' notice before layoffs. This ruling follows a similar decision by another judge in San Francisco, and the Trump administration plans to appeal both decisions.

The judge's order affects probationary employees nationwide and includes agencies not previously covered by other rulings. The states argued that the lack of advance notice hindered their ability to provide necessary support to affected workers and resulted in increased unemployment claims and lost tax revenue. The ruling emphasizes that while the government can implement reductions in force, it must do so in compliance with federal law.

Bredar noted the significant burden placed on state governments when a large employer lays off thousands of employees suddenly. The lawsuit is part of broader legal challenges addressing the wave of firings under the Trump administration, which has also announced deeper cuts across the federal workforce.
