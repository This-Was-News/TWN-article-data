## Article summary
Bernie Sanders is currently leading a "Fighting Oligarchy" tour, attracting record crowds as he criticizes President Trump's administration and the Democratic Party's lack of a unified response. His message of economic populism resonates with voters frustrated by the growing influence of billionaires in politics, particularly as Trump's policies threaten public welfare programs. Sanders argues that the Democratic Party must reclaim its commitment to the working class by addressing issues like income inequality and healthcare to regain voter trust.

During recent rallies, including one in Denver that drew over 30,000 attendees, Sanders vowed to oppose Trump's agenda, emphasizing the need for Democrats to be more vocal and organized against the perceived threats posed by wealthy elites. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined him in calling for greater unity among voters to combat the divisive tactics of the wealthy. Polls indicate widespread dissatisfaction with both Trump's leadership and the Democratic Party's current strategy, highlighting a demand for more assertive action from Democratic leaders.

Sanders believes that his longstanding message appeals to a broad audience, including working-class Republicans, who oppose tax breaks for the wealthy while cutting essential services. As the Democratic Party grapples with its identity and strategy, the success of Sanders' tour suggests a potential shift in how the party might engage with its base moving forward.
