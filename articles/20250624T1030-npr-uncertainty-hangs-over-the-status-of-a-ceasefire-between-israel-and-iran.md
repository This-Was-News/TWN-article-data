## Article summary
The status of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran remains uncertain despite President Trump's announcement of an agreement between the two nations. While both countries initially indicated their agreement to halt hostilities, reports of continued airstrikes in Israel raised questions about the ceasefire's viability. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered a strong military response to alleged Iranian airstrikes, which Iran denied. The ceasefire follows a week and a half of intense conflict, with significant casualties reported on both sides. Iran's state media claimed the ceasefire was imposed on Israel, which does not officially recognize Iran as a state. The death toll from the conflict is unclear, with reports of hundreds of civilian casualties in Iran and a smaller number in Israel. Trump emphasized the importance of adhering to the ceasefire in his communications. Vice President Vance suggested that Iran might be seeking to end the fighting. The situation remains tense, with both sides exchanging attacks even as the ceasefire was set to begin.
