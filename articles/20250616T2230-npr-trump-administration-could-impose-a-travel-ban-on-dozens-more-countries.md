## Article summary
The Trump administration is contemplating expanding its travel ban to include up to 36 additional countries, potentially tripling the current list of 19 nations under full or partial restrictions. A memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlines concerns regarding the vetting and screening processes of these countries, which are deemed deficient. The nations targeted include several from Africa, Central Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands, with issues such as unreliable identity documents and high rates of visa overstays contributing to the proposed bans. Countries that fail to address U.S. concerns by a specified deadline could face travel restrictions as early as August. The Department of Homeland Security argues that limiting entry will enhance national security and community safety. Critics, however, view these travel bans as racially and religiously discriminatory, particularly against African and Muslim-majority nations. Currently, nations fully banned include Afghanistan and Iran, while several others face partial restrictions. The memo emphasizes the need for foreign governments to cooperate in deporting their citizens to mitigate U.S. security concerns. The proposed travel bans reflect an ongoing immigration crackdown during Trump’s presidency.
