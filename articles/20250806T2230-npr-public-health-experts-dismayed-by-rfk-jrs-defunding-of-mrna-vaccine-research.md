## Article summary
Public health experts express concern over the decision by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to cancel nearly $500 million in contracts for mRNA vaccine research, including 22 contracts overseen by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The move, which follows the cancellation of a $766 million contract with Moderna for flu vaccine development, has been criticized by infectious disease experts who warn of increased vulnerability to future pandemics and bioterrorism threats. Kennedy's decision is based on the claim that mRNA vaccines are unsafe and ineffective, a stance contradicted by many outside experts who assert the technology's proven safety and effectiveness. Critics argue that shifting focus to older vaccine technologies could hinder rapid response to emerging threats and undermine public trust in vaccines. The decision has been welcomed by vaccine critics but condemned by public health professionals who fear it will have severe consequences for national security and public health.
