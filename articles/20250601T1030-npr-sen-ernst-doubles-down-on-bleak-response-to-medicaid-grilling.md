## Article summary
Sen. Joni Ernst faced backlash during a town hall in Iowa after her flippant response to concerns about Medicaid cuts, stating, "We all are going to die." This comment drew shouts and boos from constituents upset with her support for President Trump's controversial One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which proposes significant cuts to social programs. Despite the hostile atmosphere, Ernst defended the bill, claiming that those losing Medicaid benefits were ineligible for them. The GOP budget package aims to provide tax cuts for the wealthy while slashing funding for programs like Medicaid and SNAP, potentially adding trillions to the national debt. Following the town hall, Ernst posted a sarcastic apology video from a cemetery, reiterating her belief that everyone will eventually die. She also dismissed concerns about the bill's implications, suggesting that those seeking eternal life should embrace Christianity. The town hall highlighted growing tensions between Ernst and her constituents over the proposed legislation and her alignment with Trump. Amidst dissent, she maintained a casual demeanor and expressed enjoyment in hearing from her constituents. The bill is currently undergoing reconciliation in the Senate, facing opposition over its more controversial aspects.
