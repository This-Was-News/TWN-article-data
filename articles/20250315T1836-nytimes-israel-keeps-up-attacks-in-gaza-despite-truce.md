## Article summary
Israel has continued its military strikes in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of at least nine Palestinians, despite a truce with Hamas that has been in effect for about two months. The Israeli military claims these attacks are in response to threats posed by militants, who are accused of laying explosives and operating drones near Israeli troops. Since the cease-fire began, Hamas reports that over 150 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, including civilians, asserting that Israel is violating the truce agreement.

On the day of the latest strikes, Israel targeted militants operating a drone and later attacked a vehicle linked to them. The identities of those killed remain unverified, as Hamas claims they were charity workers. The ongoing military actions highlight the fragility of the cease-fire, with a comprehensive peace agreement still elusive.

Negotiations for a more permanent resolution, including the release of hostages and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, are reportedly stalled amid significant disagreements. The conflict escalated after Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in substantial casualties. Israeli officials maintain that military actions will continue until Hamas's control over Gaza is dismantled.
