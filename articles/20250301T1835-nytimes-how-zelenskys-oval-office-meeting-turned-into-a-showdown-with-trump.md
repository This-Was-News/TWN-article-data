## Article summary
The Oval Office meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and President Trump turned confrontational, raising questions about whether it was a spontaneous clash or a premeditated confrontation. Senator Lindsey Graham advised Zelensky to avoid arguments, but the Ukrainian leader voiced concerns about U.S. support, which displeased Trump. The meeting, initially aimed at finalizing a minerals deal, devolved into a public dressing down of Zelensky by Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Tensions escalated as Zelensky pressed for security guarantees against Russian aggression, a demand Trump resisted. Their exchange became heated, with Trump mocking Zelensky and dismissing concerns about the war's impact on the U.S. After the meeting, scheduled events, including a signing ceremony and joint news conference, were abruptly canceled, reflecting Trump's displeasure. Despite the fallout, Zelensky expressed hope for repairing the relationship, though some Republican leaders suggested he should resign. The incident highlighted the fractured dynamics within the GOP regarding Ukraine and Russia. Ultimately, the meeting left Zelensky without the expected deal and strained ties with a crucial ally.
