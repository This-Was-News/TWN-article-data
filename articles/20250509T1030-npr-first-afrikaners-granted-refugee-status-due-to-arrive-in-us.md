## Article summary
The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners from South Africa, marking the first acceptance of this group following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in February. The refugees are expected to arrive in the U.S. on May 12, with plans for a charter flight to Dulles Airport, although commercial flights may be used if necessary. The executive order prioritizes humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination in South Africa. States such as Colorado, Massachusetts, and California have agreed to resettle the new arrivals, many of whom have family ties in the U.S. 

The Afrikaners have been assigned P1 refugee status, allowing them a pathway to U.S. citizenship and access to government benefits. Criticism has arisen from the South African government, which argues that the Afrikaners are economically privileged and highlights the plight of vulnerable migrants in the U.S. Trump and his adviser Elon Musk have claimed that Afrikaners face persecution, particularly regarding land issues, despite South Africa's government stating that no land has been confiscated under recent reforms. The process of granting refugee status has been notably swift, with a press conference planned for their arrival. The U.N.'s International Organization for Migration has declined to participate in the resettlement process.
