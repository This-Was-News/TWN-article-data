## Article summary
Trump's "big, beautiful bill," recently passed by the House, allocates approximately $170 billion for immigration enforcement, marking a significant federal investment in this area. The bill provides $45 billion for immigration detention centers and around $30 billion for hiring additional ICE personnel, aiming to detain and deport more individuals. It also includes $46.5 billion to complete the border wall and additional funding for Customs and Border Protection facilities. Critics express concern that the increased funding for detention could lead to broader use of detention, complicating migrants' access to legal representation and their rights. 

The bill introduces new fees for immigration processes, including a reduced asylum application fee of $100, but increases other fees that may hinder access to justice for many immigrants. It restricts health coverage and benefits for lawfully present immigrants, further limiting access to essential services. Over $3 billion is earmarked for immigration courts to hire more judges, yet the cap of 800 judges may not suffice to address the backlog of nearly 4 million cases. Overall, while the bill aims to enhance immigration enforcement, its implementation and impact on individuals and families remain contentious issues.
