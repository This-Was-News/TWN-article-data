## Article summary
The USDA is requesting states to provide sensitive personal data of food stamp recipients, including Social Security numbers and citizenship status, as part of an effort to combat alleged fraud within the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This unprecedented demand follows a directive from the Trump administration to consolidate data across federal programs, raising concerns about privacy violations and the potential for misuse in deportation efforts. Critics, including privacy advocates, warn that the request could enable mass surveillance and exacerbate fears among immigrant families regarding their participation in SNAP, despite the program being designed to assist eligible individuals. 

The USDA's request prioritizes data fields such as names, addresses, and personal identifiers over key financial eligibility information, which has alarmed many stakeholders. Recent reports suggest that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is involved in accessing sensitive data across various agencies to support these initiatives. 

While improper payments within SNAP are rare, with most attributed to unintentional errors rather than fraud, the current administration's focus on perceived misuse has led to heightened scrutiny of immigrant participation in public assistance programs. Advocacy groups emphasize the importance of reassuring eligible families that their information will be protected and used solely for program administration. As states grapple with the legality and implications of the USDA's data requests, concerns persist about how this information could be weaponized against vulnerable populations.
