## Article summary
The S&P 500 faced significant turmoil, closing 17.6% below its February peak and teetering on the brink of a bear market, following a chaotic trading day marked by volatility and false reports regarding U.S. tariffs. Investors remain concerned about the economic impact of steep tariffs imposed by the U.S. and retaliatory measures from China, with fears of a potential recession looming. The index experienced its largest intraday swing since March 2020, reflecting heightened market anxiety. Analysts warn that prolonged tariffs could lead to severe economic consequences, with some forecasting a recession within the year. The situation worsened as President Trump threatened to impose a 104% tax on Chinese exports if tariffs on U.S. products were not rescinded. European and Asian markets suffered even greater losses, with significant declines recorded across major indices. The sell-off was characterized as a self-inflicted economic disaster, with executives advising consumers to expect rising prices and potential job losses. Despite some optimistic views, the overall sentiment among economists remains cautious, indicating that markets may decline further as economic growth expectations struggle to align with tariff realities.
