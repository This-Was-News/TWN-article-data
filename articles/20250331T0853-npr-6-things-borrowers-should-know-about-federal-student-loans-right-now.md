## Article summary
The current state of federal student loans is marked by significant uncertainty and challenges for borrowers. Approximately 9 million borrowers are at risk of default as the repayment system resumes after a long pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, which had gained 8 million enrollees, is now in legal jeopardy, leading experts to predict its demise. While income-driven repayment plans have reopened, recent administrative changes have caused confusion and delays for borrowers trying to recertify their income. 

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program remains unchanged for now, although new restrictions are being proposed by the Trump administration. With the federal office overseeing student loans significantly downsized, borrowers are advised to take initiative and educate themselves about their options. The ongoing legal disputes and administrative shifts are expected to complicate the loan landscape further. Borrowers are encouraged to stay vigilant and proactive as the era of leniency comes to an end, and the risk of default looms large.
