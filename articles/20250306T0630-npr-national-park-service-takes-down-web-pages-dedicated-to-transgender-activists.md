## Article summary
The National Park Service (NPS) has removed web pages dedicated to transgender activists and LGBTQ history, part of a broader federal initiative to alter such content. Key figures like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, pivotal in the Stonewall Uprising, have seen their mentions disappear from the NPS website. This censorship has led to criticisms from various advocates, who argue that it undermines the representation of LGBTQ history in national parks. Some links to historical research about LGBTQ contributions have also been rendered inactive, while others remain intact, highlighting inconsistent removal efforts. 

Alan Spears from the National Parks Conservation Association condemned these actions, asserting that LGBTQ+ history is integral to American history and should be preserved. Historians like Michael Bronski view the deletions as a symbolic attack on progress and recognition of LGBTQ rights. The NPS's response cites compliance with recent executive orders aimed at redefining gender-related content. Critics emphasize that these efforts to erase LGBTQ history signify a troubling precedent in historical documentation and public education.
