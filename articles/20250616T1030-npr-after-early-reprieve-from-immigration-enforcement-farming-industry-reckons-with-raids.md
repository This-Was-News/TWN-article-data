## Article summary
The farming industry is grappling with increased immigration enforcement as federal officials have targeted farms and meatpacking plants for raids, detaining many workers without legal status. President Trump has expressed support for farmers, suggesting that deporting their workforce could harm agriculture, but his administration's mixed messages have left many in the sector uncertain. Following recent raids, there have been reports of agricultural employers learning their rights and resisting federal intrusions. The ongoing enforcement actions have heightened fears among farmworkers and their families, many of whom have been in the U.S. for years.

The agricultural sector relies heavily on undocumented workers, with about 42% of crop farmworkers lacking legal status. Farmers are advocating for changes to the H-2A visa program to allow for year-round labor, particularly for dairy farms, which cannot utilize this temporary visa. Concerns over potential disruptions to the food supply chain due to mass deportations have been voiced by industry leaders. Despite the fear and uncertainty, many workers continue to show up for work, indicating their determination to maintain agricultural production. Advocates argue that the recent enforcement actions should serve as a wake-up call regarding the vulnerability of farmworkers in the current political climate.
