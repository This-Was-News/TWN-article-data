## Article summary
A federal judge in San Francisco is deliberating on a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's mass firings of probationary federal employees. The case, brought by a coalition of labor unions and civic organizations, claims the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) unlawfully directed agencies to carry out these terminations. The plaintiffs seek not only to halt the firings but also to reinstate the dismissed employees, arguing that OPM lacks the authority to dictate employment actions in other agencies. Thousands of employees have been terminated recently, often under similar justifications citing performance issues, despite many having no record of problems.

The unions assert that agencies executed these firings on OPM’s orders, while the Trump administration denies the existence of a "mass termination program." Additionally, the government argues that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue and that the court does not have jurisdiction over such employment disputes, which should be resolved through established federal channels. The case highlights the significant impact of these firings, with some organizations noting that the terminations could affect essential services, such as veterans' transportation to medical appointments. Meanwhile, the Merit Systems Protection Board has temporarily reinstated six employees pending further investigation into their firings.
