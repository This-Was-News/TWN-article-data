## Article summary
The Blue Ghost spacecraft, developed by Firefly Aerospace, successfully landed on the moon early Sunday morning, marking a significant milestone in private space exploration. This historic landing occurred at 3:34 a.m. EST and is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative, which collaborates with private companies to deliver scientific instruments to the lunar surface. Blue Ghost is the first commercial lander to achieve a fully successful soft landing on the moon, following several previous unsuccessful attempts by other companies. 

The spacecraft is carrying ten NASA experiments, including instruments to measure lunar heat flow and collect rock samples. Blue Ghost's mission is also connected to NASA's Artemis program, aimed at returning astronauts to the moon. After its landing, the spacecraft began transmitting images back to Earth, showcasing its surroundings. Launched on January 15 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Blue Ghost traveled over 2.8 million miles in 45 days to reach its destination beside the Mons Latreille volcanic feature in Mare Crisium. The mission represents a new phase in the collaboration between NASA and private space ventures.
