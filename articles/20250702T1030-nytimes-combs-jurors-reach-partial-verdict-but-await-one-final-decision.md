## Article summary
A jury in Manhattan reached a partial verdict in the federal trial of music mogul Sean Combs, deadlocking on the racketeering conspiracy charge while deciding on four other counts related to sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution. After over 12 hours of deliberation, the jury indicated they could not reach a unanimous decision on the racketeering count, which alleges Combs operated a criminal enterprise with his employees over two decades. Combs has pleaded not guilty, and his defense maintains that the sexual activities were consensual. Judge Arun Subramanian encouraged the jury to continue discussions, emphasizing that no juror should compromise their beliefs for a unanimous verdict. The racketeering charge requires jurors to find that Combs knowingly joined an unlawful conspiracy and agreed to commit criminal acts to further the enterprise. Prosecutors allege that Combs and his associates engaged in various crimes, including drug distribution and sex trafficking, using manipulation and threats against women involved. The two primary witnesses testified extensively, while the defense argued the women participated willingly. Combs, who has been in detention since his arrest in September, faces a possible life sentence if convicted of the most serious charges. The jury will resume deliberations on Wednesday morning.
