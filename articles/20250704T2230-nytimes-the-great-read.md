## Article summary
The annual Space-Out Competition in Seoul challenges participants to remain silent and still for an hour and a half, with heart rates measured periodically. The event, founded by artist Woopsyang in 2014, aims to reframe the perception of downtime as valuable, especially in a society known for its long working hours. This year, over 4,000 people applied for 80 spots, highlighting the widespread desire for a break from busyness. Contestants included a mix of characters, from a clown to a punk band, with many viewing their everyday moments of idleness as practice for the competition. 

The author, initially drawn to the idea of winning a trophy by doing nothing, struggles with the stress of competition and the challenge of achieving a meditative state. Research on boredom suggests that many people find it difficult to tolerate inactivity, often resorting to distractions like self-administered electric shocks. Despite attempts to meditate and clear the mind, the author finds it hard to stay focused and experiences a mix of thoughts throughout the event. Ultimately, the author finishes with a slowed heart rate but lacks enough audience votes to win, realizing that the pursuit of doing nothing can paradoxically lead to overthinking. In the end, the experience teaches that achieving nothing can itself be a form of accomplishment.
