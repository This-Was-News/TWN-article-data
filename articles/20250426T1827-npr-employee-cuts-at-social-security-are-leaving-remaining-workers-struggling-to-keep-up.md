## Article summary
Employee cuts at the Social Security Administration (SSA) are causing significant strain on remaining staff and leading to longer wait times for services. The agency has reduced its workforce by about 12%, resulting in over 2,500 employees leaving, many from critical roles in field offices. Workers report feeling overwhelmed and burned out as they handle increased public demand amid staff shortages. The SSA's phone service wait times have escalated from an average of one hour to over an hour and a half, with call volumes rising sharply due to public confusion and fear regarding recent policy changes.

Local offices, particularly those losing a significant portion of their staff, are experiencing heightened pressure as they absorb the workload of departed colleagues. The Trump administration has pledged not to cut benefits, but advocates argue that the reduction in staff equates to a cut in services, delaying access to essential benefits for Americans. Plans to reassign staff from non-critical roles to field offices have raised concerns about the loss of expertise and the feasibility of such transitions. Former SSA officials express deep concern over the agency's ability to maintain its functions with the diminishing workforce, warning that critical knowledge could be lost permanently.
