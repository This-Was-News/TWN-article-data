## Article summary
Vance Luther Boelter, 57, is the primary suspect in a series of targeted political shootings in Minnesota that resulted in the deaths of Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as injuries to state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Authorities are conducting a national manhunt for Boelter, who allegedly masqueraded as a law enforcement officer during the attacks. Despite claims of a security career, NPR's investigation reveals that Boelter has mostly worked in the food service industry, with little evidence supporting his assertions of military or security training. Friends describe his aspirations to start a security firm as a "fantasy," with no real progress made. Boelter is considered armed and dangerous, and law enforcement has urged the public to report sightings. Investigators are examining his background and motives, particularly after discovering a written message he left behind. The shootings have been characterized as politically motivated, with implications for the safety of other public officials. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz condemned the violence, emphasizing the importance of peaceful discourse in democracy. The investigation continues to explore whether Boelter acted alone or had accomplices.
