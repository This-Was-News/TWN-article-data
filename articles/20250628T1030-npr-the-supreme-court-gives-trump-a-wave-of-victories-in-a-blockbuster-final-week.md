## Article summary
The Supreme Court delivered significant victories for the Trump administration in its final week of the term, with several key rulings. In a 6-3 decision, the Court limited the scope of universal injunctions related to birthright citizenship, allowing for a temporary hold on Trump's executive order while litigation continues. Additionally, the Court ruled that parents may opt their children out of classes that include LGBTQ content, reflecting ongoing cultural debates in education.

Another ruling upheld a crucial provision of the Affordable Care Act, ensuring free preventive services for approximately 150 million Americans. The Court also supported a Texas law requiring age verification for access to pornographic websites, marking a precedent for regulating adult content online. Furthermore, the justices upheld a program that provides subsidized internet access to underserved communities, dismissing challenges regarding Congressional authority.

In a separate decision, the Court postponed a case on Louisiana's congressional redistricting plan to the next term, addressing concerns about racial gerrymandering. Lastly, the Court allowed South Carolina to restrict Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, emphasizing state rights to disqualify providers based on their services. These rulings highlight the ideological divides within the Court and their implications for various social and legal issues.
