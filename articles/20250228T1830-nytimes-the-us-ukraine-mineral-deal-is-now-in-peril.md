## Article summary
The U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal has been jeopardized following a tense meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. leaders, President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. During this meeting, Trump and Vance criticized Zelensky for not expressing adequate gratitude for U.S. support and pressured him to agree to a peace deal. The anticipated signing of the agreement, which would have allowed Ukraine to share its natural resources revenues with the U.S., was abruptly called off. Trump indicated that if Zelensky did not comply, the U.S. would withdraw its support, leaving Ukraine to face its challenges alone.

The proposed deal involved Ukraine contributing half of its future natural resource revenues to a U.S.-controlled fund, with the intent to reinvest some of these revenues back into Ukraine. However, the agreement lacked specific security guarantees that Ukraine had been seeking amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia. Zelensky's visit aimed to secure U.S. military backing and a role in negotiations with Russia, but Trump has offered no such involvement for him in recent talks. The breakdown in discussions signals a significant shift in the dynamics of U.S.-Ukraine relations during a critical wartime period.
