## Article summary
President Trump announced on Monday that the U.S. military is prepared to deploy to any city to combat crime, even without a governor's request. He signed an executive order creating a specialized National Guard unit to assist local law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and potentially nationwide to quell civil disturbances and ensure public safety. Trump mentioned the possibility of targeting Chicago next for a federal crackdown on crime but hedged when pressed, stating he would not act without a request from Illinois' governor. Earlier, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, criticized the potential deployment as illegal, undemocratic, and unconstitutional, emphasizing that Chicago has not requested federal troops. The mayor also noted that his office had not received direct communication from the White House regarding a potential deployment.
