## Article summary
The U.S. has confirmed its first human case of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite typically affecting livestock, with a rare but potentially fatal impact on humans. The case, linked to travel from El Salvador, was detected in Maryland and has since been resolved without further transmission. The screwworm, a parasitic fly native to South America and the Caribbean, lays eggs in living animals, with larvae feeding on flesh. While human cases are rare, they can be painful and have high mortality rates if untreated. The parasite poses a significant threat to livestock, particularly cattle, and has been detected in Mexico, prompting U.S. authorities to take measures to prevent its spread. The U.S. previously eradicated the screwworm using the sterile insect technique, but recent outbreaks in Central America have raised concerns. The USDA is now building a sterile-fly production facility in Texas and supporting efforts in Mexico to combat the parasite's spread, aiming to protect the U.S. cattle industry from potential economic losses.
