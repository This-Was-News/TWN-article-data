## Article summary
President Donald Trump signed an executive order threatening to withhold federal funding from local and state governments that offer cashless bail, arguing it poses a threat to public safety. Cashless bail allows individuals to be released from jail without paying money while awaiting trial, contrasting with traditional cash bail systems. Illinois became the first state to eliminate cash bail in 2023, with other jurisdictions like New Jersey and Washington, D.C., also limiting its use. Judges decide on release based on factors like criminal charges, danger to others, and flight risk. Studies on the impact of cashless bail on crime show mixed results, with some indicating no significant increase in crime rates. Proponents argue cashless bail eliminates penalties on poverty, while critics warn it may release violent criminals. The White House cited a 2022 report from Yolo County, California, showing a high rearrest rate under a temporary cashless bail system. The debate continues over the effectiveness and safety of cashless bail policies.
