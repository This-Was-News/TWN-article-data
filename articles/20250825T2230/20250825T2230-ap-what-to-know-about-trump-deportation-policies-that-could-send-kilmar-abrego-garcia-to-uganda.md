## Article summary
The Trump administration's efforts to deport immigrants to third countries, including Uganda, have sparked controversy. These agreements allow the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands with minimal notice. The Supreme Court recently upheld these policies, which have been criticized for violating due process rights and sending immigrants to countries with poor human rights records. The administration claims these measures target violent criminals and address national security threats. Countries like El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, and Uganda have agreed to accept deportees, despite concerns over human rights abuses. The U.S. has also pressured Latin American countries to facilitate deportations, sometimes under the threat of sanctions. Human rights advocates and the United Nations have condemned these practices, citing risks of torture and arbitrary detention. Meanwhile, the European Union is exploring similar deportation hubs, and Italy has faced legal challenges over its detention centers in Albania. The UK's failed plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda highlights the broader global debate over immigration policies.
