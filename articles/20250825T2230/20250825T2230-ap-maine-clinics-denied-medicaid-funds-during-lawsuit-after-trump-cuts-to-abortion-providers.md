## Article summary
A network of clinics in Maine, Maine Family Planning, will not resume receiving Medicaid funds during its lawsuit over Trump administration cuts to abortion providers, a judge ruled. The decision comes despite a previous ruling that Planned Parenthood clinics must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding. Without Medicaid, Maine Family Planning says it will have to stop serving hundreds of primary care patients by the end of October. The organization argues that Medicaid dollars are not used for its abortion services and that it is unfair to cut off funding solely because Congress wanted to defund Planned Parenthood. Judge Lance Walker ruled that Congress can withhold federal funds from organizations not engaged in constitutionally protected conduct. Maine Family Planning warns that the ruling will destabilize the state's health infrastructure by potentially turning away low-income patients. The organization is considering all options to ensure that Maine's Medicaid patients can continue to receive necessary healthcare. The Trump administration's policy and tax bill blocked Medicaid money from flowing to Planned Parenthood and other providers like Maine Family Planning. The bill did not mention Planned Parenthood by name but cut off reimbursements for organizations primarily engaged in family planning services.
