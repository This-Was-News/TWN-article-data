## Article summary
An Israeli military strike on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza killed 20 people, including five journalists, on Monday. Emergency responders and journalists rushed to the scene after the first strike, but a second strike hit the same area shortly after, causing widespread devastation. The journalists worked for Reuters, The Associated Press, and Al Jazeera. The Israeli military acknowledged carrying out a strike in the area but did not specify the target. Israel expressed regret for the incident and initiated an inquiry. The attack has sparked international outrage, as the war in Gaza has already been deadly for journalists, with nearly 200 killed since the conflict began. Israel has restricted international journalists from entering Gaza, relying on local Palestinian journalists to report on the situation. The United Nations human rights office called for accountability and justice. The circumstances of the attack remain unclear, and Israel's conduct in the war has faced international censure. Over 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including about 18,000 children, according to health officials. The Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.
