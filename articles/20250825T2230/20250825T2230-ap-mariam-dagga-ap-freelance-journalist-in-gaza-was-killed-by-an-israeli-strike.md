## Article summary
Maram Dagga, a 33-year-old freelance journalist for The Associated Press and other news organizations, was killed by an Israeli strike on a hospital in Gaza. She captured harrowing images of the war's impact on ordinary Palestinians, including displaced families, wounded children, and mourners. Dagga was based at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis and was among 20 people, including five journalists, killed in the strike. She focused on the war's impact on children and was praised for her dedication and ethical reporting. Dagga had appealed to the international community to protect journalists in Gaza and end the war. She is survived by her 13-year-old son, who moved to the United Arab Emirates at the start of the war. Colleagues described her as always ready to work despite severe hardships and deeply respected. Before the war, she donated a kidney to her father. Dagga's recent coverage of malnourished children in Gaza earned her an internal AP award.
