## Article summary
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland construction worker from El Salvador, was detained by ICE during a check-in in Baltimore. He was taken into federal custody after entering an ICE field office, a move that was expected. Garcia, who was previously wrongfully deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., expressed hope and strength from seeing his family before his detention. He filed a lawsuit challenging his detention and any deportation to Uganda or elsewhere until a trial is held. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Garcia is being processed for removal to Uganda. Garcia's case highlights issues of due process amid President Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants. He was initially arrested in March and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation there due to fears of gang persecution. The Trump administration admitted the deportation was an administrative error and returned Garcia to the U.S. to face criminal charges, including conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants. Garcia's attorneys argue that the offer to deport him to Costa Rica if he pleads guilty is coercive and vindictive. Garcia urged his supporters to continue fighting for dignity and liberty for himself and others.
