## Article summary
Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a key accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, passed away earlier this year at the age of 41. Her memoir, 'Nobody's Girl,' is set to be published posthumously on October 21 by Alfred A. Knopf. Giuffre was instrumental in exposing Epstein's sex trafficking ring, which exploited hundreds of minors and young women. Her memoir details her experiences and the fight for accountability. Giuffre's earlier memoir, 'The Billionaire's Playboy Club,' described the lasting effects of her traumatic abuse. She initially came forward after learning she was identified as a victim in Epstein's 2008 plea deal. Giuffre sued Epstein, alleging child exploitation and transportation of minors for illegal activities. Epstein settled her lawsuit for over $500,000, and Prince Andrew also settled a lawsuit from Giuffre in 2022. Ghislaine Maxwell, who was involved in the trafficking ring, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein died in 2019 while in federal custody, with officials ruling his death a suicide, though public skepticism remains.
