## Article summary
The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Jeffrey Epstein's estate for documents, including a birthday book, will, agreements with prosecutors, contact books, and financial records. The subpoena, signed by Rep. James Comer, aims to investigate potential mismanagement of the federal government's investigation into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's death, sex-trafficking rings, and ethical violations by elected officials. The committee is also reviewing the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death and the operation of sex-trafficking rings. The Justice Department has begun providing documents to lawmakers but Democrats on the committee are unsatisfied, stating that the released documents are mostly already public. Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, criticized the DOJ's limited disclosure, asserting that the White House is not interested in justice for victims or the truth. Lawmakers are likely to increase pressure for more information when Congress returns to Washington next week. A bipartisan group of House members is attempting to bypass Republican leadership to vote on legislation requiring the DOJ to release a full accounting of the Epstein sex-trafficking investigation.
