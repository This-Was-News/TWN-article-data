## Article summary
Five Palestinian journalists working for international news organizations were killed in Gaza on Monday, along with several others, in what local officials described as an Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel acknowledged carrying out a strike in the area but did not identify the target, stating that it does not target journalists. At least 192 journalists have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the deaths a tragic mishap and stated that Israel values the work of journalists and is conducting a thorough investigation. The journalists killed include Maram Dagga, a 33-year-old visual journalist who freelanced for The Associated Press and other outlets; Hussam al-Masr, a Reuters cameraman; Mohammad Salama, an Al Jazeera cameraman; Ahmed Abu Azz, a freelance journalist for Middle East Eye; and Moaz Abu Taha, a freelance journalist whose work was occasionally published by Reuters. The journalists were known for their courageous reporting under dangerous conditions.
