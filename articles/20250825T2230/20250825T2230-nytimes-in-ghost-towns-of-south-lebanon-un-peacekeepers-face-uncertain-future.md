## Article summary
U.N. peacekeepers have patrolled the volatile border between Israel and southern Lebanon for nearly 50 years, a region dominated by the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. The future of this peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, is now uncertain. Following a major conflict between Israel and Hezbollah last year, there is pressure to disband UNIFIL, with its annual mandate up for renewal. Israel argues that UNIFIL's mission is obsolete due to Hezbollah's weakened state, while Lebanese and European officials warn that withdrawing the force could jeopardize the fragile cease-fire. Around 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers are currently stationed in southern Lebanon, serving as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah since the mission's establishment in 1978. The situation remains fragile, with concerns about the potential impact of UNIFIL's withdrawal on regional stability.
