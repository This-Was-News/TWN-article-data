## Article summary
On March 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department, a long-held goal of conservatives. The signing took place in the East Room of the White House, attended by children, conservative activists, and several Republican governors. Trump, seeking reassurance from the children present, received enthusiastic nods as he prepared to sign the order. He acknowledged the unusual nature of the moment, expressing that the action might sound strange but insisted it was the right move, despite Congress being the body that can officially abolish a cabinet agency. 

The executive order directs the Education Department to formulate a plan for its own shutdown, highlighting Trump’s intent to reshape federal education policy. While he recognized the implications for the department's workforce, he emphasized the importance of teachers and reassured that federal Pell Grant funding would remain intact. The atmosphere in the room was celebratory, with many attendees expressing their excitement over what they viewed as a significant educational reform. Activists and supporters noted that while previous Republican presidents had promised similar changes, Trump was finally taking action. This event marked a notable shift in Trump's approach to education policy since his first term.
