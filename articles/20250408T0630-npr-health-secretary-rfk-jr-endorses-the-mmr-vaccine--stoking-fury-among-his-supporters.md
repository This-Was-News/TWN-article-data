## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has endorsed the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, a move that has sparked outrage among anti-vaccine supporters. In a social media post, he stated that the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles, following a recent outbreak in Texas that resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Kennedy's endorsement aligns with scientific evidence showing the vaccine's effectiveness, with a single dose providing approximately 93% protection and two doses increasing that to 97%. Despite this, prominent anti-vaccine activists criticized his statement, arguing it contradicts their movement's goals. Some claimed Kennedy's remarks were poorly worded, while others suggested he was betraying his previous stance against vaccines.

Kennedy's history includes leading an anti-vaccine nonprofit and expressing skepticism about vaccine efficacy in past interviews. His recent acknowledgment of the MMR vaccine's benefits has been met with mixed reactions, as some health professionals welcomed the endorsement, while others expressed concern over his promotion of alternative therapies that lack scientific backing. Experts warn that the ongoing measles outbreak is not being effectively controlled, highlighting the dangers of misinformation surrounding vaccines. Overall, Kennedy's support for the MMR vaccine represents a significant shift in his public health messaging, raising questions about his motivations and the impact on his supporters.
