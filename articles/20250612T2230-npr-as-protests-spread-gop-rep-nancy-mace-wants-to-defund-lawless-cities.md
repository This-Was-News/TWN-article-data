## Article summary
Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina has introduced the Lawless Cities Accountability Act, aiming to defund cities deemed "lawless" due to ongoing unrest or failure to enforce laws, particularly in response to recent immigration protests in Los Angeles. Mace asserts that cities siding with rioters or defunding police should face federal funding cuts, which would be determined by the U.S. attorney general and the administration. The protests in Los Angeles, which have seen heightened tensions and a National Guard deployment by Trump without state approval, have sparked discussions about law enforcement and public safety. Mace argues that the images of violence during the protests necessitate a strong federal response to uphold law and order. While acknowledging that protests can be peaceful, she emphasizes that violence and property damage are unacceptable. Mace expressed support for Trump and his administration’s actions, believing they have been lawful and necessary. The bill would block federal funding for local officials in cities that fail to manage protests effectively. The situation has also led to legal challenges from California officials against the federal government. Overall, Mace's stance reflects a push for accountability in city governance amid rising civil unrest.
