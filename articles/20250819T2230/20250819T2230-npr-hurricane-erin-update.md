## Article summary
Hurricane Erin is moving closer to the Eastern seaboard, bringing dangerous rip currents and flood risks. As of Tuesday, it was 615 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C., with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph, down from 140 mph the previous day. Although it is not expected to make landfall, the storm will push large waves of 15 to 20 feet or higher onto the shoreline, along with storm surge. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Outer Banks, with tropical storm conditions expected to begin late Wednesday. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands, and authorities warn of life-threatening inundation of 2 to 4 feet above ground level. The storm's massive size, rather than its wind speeds, poses the greatest threat, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 230 miles from its center. Experts note that the storm's size is correlated with higher storm surge levels and more dramatic impacts, particularly in vulnerable areas like the Outer Banks. Despite the storm's distance from the coast, its effects will be felt far from the center, with high risks of life-threatening surf and rip currents from Florida to Long Island, New York. The storm's unusual size means that even official advisories may underestimate the risk of tropical-storm-force winds being felt onshore. Hurricane Erin is the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, but experts caution that climate change is leading to fewer but more intense storms.
