## Article summary
In northern Gaza, desperate Palestinians risk their lives to obtain U.N.-distributed flour at the Zikim Corridor, where Israeli gunfire has killed over 550 people since June. Despite the danger, thousands gather daily, hoping to secure flour amid severe hunger and malnutrition. The Israeli military denies responsibility for the high death toll, attributing casualties to accidents and looting gangs. The World Food Programme (WFP) continues to deliver flour through the corridor, despite daily lethal attacks, citing a moral imperative to feed starving people. The WFP's country director emphasizes the need for a ceasefire to allow sufficient aid into Gaza, as current conditions are insufficient. Meanwhile, Palestinians, including pregnant women and children, endure extreme hardship and violence in their struggle to survive.
