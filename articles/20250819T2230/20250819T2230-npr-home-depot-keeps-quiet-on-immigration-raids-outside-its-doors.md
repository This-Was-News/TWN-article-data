## Article summary
Home Depot has remained largely silent amid immigration raids targeting day laborers outside its stores, particularly in Los Angeles. These raids have led to arrests and even a fatality, as a man died while fleeing from agents. Home Depot's official stance is that it does not engage with immigration enforcement and is not notified in advance of such operations. However, advocates for day laborers argue that the company has a moral responsibility to protect these workers, who are both customers and service providers. The relationship between Home Depot and day laborers has grown over the years, as contractors increasingly rely on them due to labor shortages and cost considerations. Despite the raids, Home Depot's sales have not been significantly impacted, and the company continues to maintain a neutral public stance on political issues, including President Trump's tariffs. Some customers and employees have noticed changes in store traffic, with fewer day laborers present, but overall sales remain steady. Critics and supporters alike are watching to see if Home Depot will take a more active role in addressing the situation.
