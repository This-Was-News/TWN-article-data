## Article summary
Lawyers for Klmar Armando Abrego Garca, an immigrant wrongfully expelled to El Salvador, accused the Justice Department of vindictive prosecution for bringing criminal charges against him after he fought his deportation. The 35-page filing in Federal District Court in Nashville argued that the Trump administration targeted Mr. Abrego Garca for asserting his due process rights, rather than due to the seriousness of his alleged conduct. The lawyers highlighted the government's missteps, including initially removing him in violation of a court order and then launching a public campaign to punish him. The filing is the second attempt to hold the administration accountable for its handling of Mr. Abrego Garca's case, following a mid-June request for sanctions. As his civil and criminal cases near a critical point, Mr. Abrego Garca is expected to be freed from criminal custody, forcing the government to decide whether to proceed with prosecution or deport him again. The lawyers also asked the court to allow him to return to Maryland as a free man while the administration decides its next steps. Motions for selective and vindictive prosecution are difficult to win, but Mr. Abrego Garca's lawyers argue that his case meets the criteria. They allege a widespread and unprecedented retaliation campaign against their client, including false claims that he was a member of the gang MS-13. Despite a judge's order for his release from El Salvador, Trump officials continued to attack him publicly. The government also used its prosecutorial powers to support its arguments against him in the court of public opinion, unsealing an indictment in June charging him with participating in a conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants. The lawyers contend that the federal authorities only re-examined a 2022 traffic stop involving Mr. Abrego Garca because he embarrassed the administration by challenging his wrongful deportation. They also pointed to statements by Trump and his top aides, which they argue demonstrate the rare case of actual vindictiveness.
