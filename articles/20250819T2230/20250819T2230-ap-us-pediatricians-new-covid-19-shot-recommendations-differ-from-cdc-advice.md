## Article summary
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued new COVID-19 vaccination recommendations that diverge significantly from U.S. government advice for the first time in 30 years. The AAP strongly recommends COVID-19 shots for children aged 6 months to 2 years and advises shots for older children if parents wish. This differs from the guidance under U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which does not recommend shots for healthy children but allows them in consultation with physicians. The AAP emphasizes the high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 in younger children and recommends vaccinations for older children with chronic conditions. The Department of Health and Human Services criticized the AAP, accusing it of undermining national immunization policy and prioritizing commercial interests. The AAP has issued vaccination recommendations since the 1930s and has generally aligned with CDC guidance, with minor differences in the past. The CDC previously urged annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans aged 6 months and older, but Kennedy recently announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. The AAP's recommendations contrast with Kennedy's new advisory panel, which voted to exclude thimerosal-containing flu vaccines, while the AAP maintains there is no evidence of harm from the preservative.
