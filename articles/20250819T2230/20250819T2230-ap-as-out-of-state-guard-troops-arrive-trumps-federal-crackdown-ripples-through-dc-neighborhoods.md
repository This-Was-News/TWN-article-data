## Article summary
President Donald Trump's decision to deploy federal law enforcement and immigration agents in Washington, D.C., has significantly impacted neighborhoods like Columbia Heights. Businesses have seen a decline, with vendors, particularly Spanish-speaking ones, disappearing due to fear. The White House credits the crackdown with hundreds of arrests, while local officials criticize the aggressive intervention. The top federal prosecutor in D.C. has opened an investigation into potential falsification of crime data by police officials. National Guard troops from several states have arrived to assist in the crackdown, performing duties like protecting landmarks and crowd control. Immigration enforcement has intensified, with agents questioning individuals about their legal status. Vendors report that customers are spending less, fearing potential detention. Resistance to Trump's actions is growing, with Democratic lawmakers introducing legislation to scrutinize the deployment of National Guard troops. The effectiveness of the National Guard in combating crime is questioned, as they are not trained for law enforcement activities. Despite a reported drop in crime, experts caution that a week is too short a period to draw meaningful conclusions.
