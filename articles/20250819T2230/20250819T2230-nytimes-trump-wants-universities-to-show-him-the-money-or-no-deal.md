## Article summary
President Trump has demanded significant financial payments from universities as part of settlement negotiations, including $200 million from Columbia University and $500 million from Harvard University. These demands have caught university leaders off guard, as they had previously been working to address antisemitism and other issues to maintain federal funding. The Trump administration has been pressuring elite schools to root out antisemitism, restore traditional gender definitions, and remove perceived liberal bias. Federal agencies have used investigations, funding freezes, and threats to international student enrollment to exert pressure. Critics have likened Trump's methods to extortion, though the White House claims the goal is to enhance trade schools and vocational training. The financial demands vary, with Columbia agreeing to pay $200 million and Harvard potentially paying $500 million. The administration's demands also include specific allocations, such as UCLA being asked to pay $1 billion to the federal government and $172 million to a claims fund. Universities feel compelled to comply due to the government's leverage over research funding. Trump's interest in the details of the settlements appears limited, but the financial demands are non-negotiable. The negotiations have shifted from agency-level discussions to direct control by the West Wing, focusing on financial promises.
