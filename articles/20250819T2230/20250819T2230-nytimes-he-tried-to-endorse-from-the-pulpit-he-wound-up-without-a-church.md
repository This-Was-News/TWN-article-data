## Article summary
A Wisconsin pastor, Rev. Jonathan Barker, resigned from Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha after facing pressure for planning a sermon endorsing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for the 2028 presidential election. The I.R.S. recently suggested churches could endorse candidates during services, but Barker's denomination, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, forbade it. Despite his resignation, Barker delivered his sermon in a borrowed space, urging Ocasio-Cortez to run. This incident highlights the differing responses of American churches to the I.R.S.'s new stance, with some conservative groups embracing political endorsements while others, like the Roman Catholic Church and mainline Protestant denominations, maintain their opposition. Legal ambiguities and concerns about losing members or prophetic status contribute to the reluctance of many denominations to endorse candidates. Barker's attempt to revitalize his declining congregation through liberal causes ultimately led to his departure, underscoring the ongoing tension between faith and politics.
