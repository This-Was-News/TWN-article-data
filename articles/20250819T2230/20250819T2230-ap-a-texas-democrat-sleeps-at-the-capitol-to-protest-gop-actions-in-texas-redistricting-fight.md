## Article summary
Texas Democratic state Rep. Nicole Collier protested Republican actions in the Texas redistricting fight by refusing to leave the state Capitol. Collier and other Democrats had previously delayed the passage of redrawn congressional maps by walking out to other states. Upon their return, Republicans required Democrats to have around-the-clock police escorts to prevent another walkout. Collier declined to sign a permission slip agreement, leading her to spend the night on the House floor. She viewed the police presence as an attack on her dignity and an attempt to control her movements. The House was scheduled to vote on the GOP plan, which aims to send five additional Republicans to the U.S. House. Democrats criticized the police escorts as a waste of taxpayer dollars and an intimidation tactic. Republicans argued that Democrats had abandoned their duties, preventing action on various issues, including flood relief and redistricting. The conflict is part of a broader national battle over redistricting, with President Donald Trump pushing GOP state officials to tilt the maps in his favor.
