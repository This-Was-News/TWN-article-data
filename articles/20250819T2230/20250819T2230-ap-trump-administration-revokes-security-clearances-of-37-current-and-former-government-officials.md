## Article summary
The Trump administration revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials, accusing them of politicizing intelligence and failing to safeguard classified information. The move, announced by Director of National Intelligence Tuls Gabbard, targets officials who left the government years ago, including some who have been critical of Trump or worked on matters like the 2016 election interference assessment. This action is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to use government power against perceived adversaries, reflecting distrust of intelligence officials from Democratic administrations. The revocation of clearances, essential for accessing sensitive information, has been a tactic used by Trump to target law firms and former officials who criticized him. Critics argue that these decisions are unlawful and unconstitutional, deviating from established laws and policies. Gabbard defended the move, stating that security clearances are a privilege, not a right. Recently, Gabbard declassified years-old documents to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Russian election interference assessment. Many affected officials learned of the revocation through news reports and are considering legal action.
