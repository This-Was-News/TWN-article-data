## Article summary
In 1974, Surnder Gupta, a medical student in New Orleans, found himself in a crisis when his car was towed late at night with his sick son inside. Desperate, he called a stranger from a phone book, Sukhdev Wala, who shared his Punjabi heritage. Wala immediately helped Gupta and his family, marking the beginning of a lifelong friendship. Both men, immigrants from India, bonded over their shared experiences and commonalities. Their families became inseparable, spending time together, sharing meals, and supporting each other. Over time, their children married, further intertwining their lives. Today, 50 years later, Gupta and Wala's families are like one, with their children having two children of their own. This story, part of the My Unsung Hero series, highlights the power of kindness and the unexpected connections it can create.
