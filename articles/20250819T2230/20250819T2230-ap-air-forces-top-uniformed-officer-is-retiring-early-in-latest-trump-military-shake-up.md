## Article summary
The Air Force's top uniformed officer, General David Allvin, is retiring early, marking the latest shake-up in military leadership during President Donald Trump's second term. Allvin will continue serving until a replacement is confirmed by the Senate and expects to retire around November 1, two years into his four-year term. He joins other top military officials who have stepped down or been removed by Trump's administration, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's plans to cut senior military positions and a purge of officers believed to support diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. For instance, Trump fired Air Force General CQ Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in February, and Air Force General Dan Cane later took over the role. Allvin, a command pilot with over 4,600 flying hours, was appointed by President Joe Biden in November 2023. He previously served as vice chief of staff during Trump's first term. Allvin expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve and thanked Secretary Mendenhall, Secretary Hegseth, and President Trump for their faith in his leadership. The Air Force directed inquiries about his departure to their official statement.
