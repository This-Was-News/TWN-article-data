## Article summary
Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), supports certain tariffs imposed by former President Trump, particularly those affecting the auto industry, despite his overall opposition to many of Trump's policies. Fain believes these tariffs address long-standing issues stemming from trade agreements like NAFTA, which he argues have led to a decline in U.S. manufacturing. He acknowledges that while tariffs may raise consumer prices, they are necessary to prevent exploitation of workers and to address the imbalances in the current economic system. Fain dismisses concerns about the stock market's reaction to tariffs, highlighting that many Americans do not own stocks and are more focused on job security and livelihoods. He argues that the auto industry can adapt to these changes, suggesting that laid-off workers could be quickly re-employed in production. Fain challenges the notion that reshoring manufacturing will result in only automated jobs, emphasizing the potential for skilled trades that offer better pay. He criticizes the corporate focus on profits at the expense of workers and calls for a reevaluation of priorities in the economy. Overall, Fain's stance reflects a commitment to protecting workers' interests in the face of global trade dynamics.
