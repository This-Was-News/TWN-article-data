## Article summary
The GOP is facing internal divisions over proposed Medicaid cuts that threaten President Trump's larger legislative agenda, which includes tax and immigration reforms. Lawmakers from swing districts are resistant to any measures that could strip benefits from Medicaid, while conservatives push for significant spending reductions. To offset the cost of extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, House Republicans need to identify $1.5 trillion in cuts, with Medicaid restructuring seen as a key avenue. House Speaker Mike Johnson reassured that essential Medicaid beneficiaries would retain their coverage, despite expert concerns about potential indirect cuts. 

Proposals under consideration include spending caps for Medicaid, work requirements for able-bodied adults, and reducing the enrollment period. Moderates have already rejected some proposals, including changes to federal funding percentages for Medicaid expansion. The party's hard-liners view the proposed cuts as just a starting point, pushing for broader reforms. With a goal of finalizing plans by Memorial Day, GOP leaders are also mindful of the need for a bill that can pass the Senate and receive presidential approval. Some Republicans express caution, recalling past failures in Medicaid reform efforts, while others emphasize the urgency of fiscal discipline.
