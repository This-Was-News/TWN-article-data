## Article summary
Germany's national parliamentary election is set for Sunday, amid pressing issues such as an economic slump, an immigration crisis, and shifting global security dynamics. The election was called unexpectedly after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government collapsed following disputes over economic policies. Current polling shows the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in second place, trailing the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is expected to lead in vote counts. CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may face challenges in forming a coalition, as mainstream parties have pledged not to partner with the AfD due to its anti-democratic reputation. Observers are concerned about the potential delay in coalition negotiations, which could take months and hinder urgent responses to Germany's economic and political crises. Merz, a conservative politician with a pro-European stance, has faced backlash for attempting to collaborate with the AfD on immigration policy. Voters express mixed feelings about his leadership capabilities, with some fearing he may compromise on his promises regarding the AfD. The new government will need to navigate complex challenges, including economic recovery and international relations, particularly regarding support for Ukraine amidst the evolving global landscape.
