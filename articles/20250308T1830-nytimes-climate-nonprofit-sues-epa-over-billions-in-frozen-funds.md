## Article summary
Climate United has filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) and Citibank, claiming they are illegally withholding nearly $7 billion in funds intended for climate projects. This funding was announced by the E.P.A. last April as part of a green financing program but has been frozen under the Trump administration's scrutiny. The lawsuit highlights that the inability to access these funds has hindered nonprofits from supporting initiatives like solar power and energy-efficient housing. The funds are part of a larger $20 billion pool that has faced controversy after E.P.A. administrator Lee Zeldin described the financing program as a rushed scheme with reduced oversight.

Climate United asserts that the freeze has severe implications for small businesses and developers relying on these grants. Despite attempts to engage with the E.P.A., meetings have been canceled, leading to frustrations among the nonprofits involved. Zeldin's actions, including linking the grants to a politically charged video, have prompted investigations by the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to cut federal spending and roll back climate policies. Legal experts express skepticism about the E.P.A.'s attempts to reclaim the already allocated funds, as they were legally obligated prior to the freeze.
