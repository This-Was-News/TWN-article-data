## Article summary
President Trump has expressed a desire to have his likeness added to Mount Rushmore, prompting discussions about the feasibility of such a change. A bill was introduced to direct the Secretary of the Interior to arrange for Trump's carving, although the National Park Service maintains that Mount Rushmore is a completed work of art with no viable locations left for additional carvings. The debate surrounding this idea involves philosophical and geological considerations, as the memorial is seen as a cultural symbol representing the nation's history. 

Historically, various figures have been suggested for addition, but the proposal gained traction with Trump's interest. Experts argue that the geological conditions of the granite make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to add another face without risking damage to the existing sculptures. Additionally, concerns about the stability of the rock and the activation of existing fractures complicate the idea further. 

As an alternative, Trump has proposed a National Garden of American Heroes, which could serve as a venue for honoring various figures without altering Mount Rushmore itself. The granddaughter of the original sculptor opposes any changes to the monument, emphasizing its historical significance over political implications. Ultimately, while the idea of adding Trump's face to Mount Rushmore has sparked interest, practical and philosophical barriers make it unlikely.
