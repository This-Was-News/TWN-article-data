## Article summary
The Education Department cuts initiated by President Trump threaten critical funding for low-income and rural schools. An executive order aims to close the Department of Education, significantly reducing its workforce, particularly impacting the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which will see nearly all of its staff laid off. This loss of personnel raises concerns about the future of federal grants like Title I and the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP), which are essential for supporting high-needs schools. While current funding for the 2025-26 school year may remain intact, the ability to assess school eligibility for future grants is compromised due to the lack of data experts. 

Experts warn that without the necessary oversight and guidance from NCES, federal funds may not reach the students who need them most, exacerbating existing challenges in underfunded districts. The cuts could lead to a devastating impact on school budgets, particularly in rural areas where resources are already limited. As local leaders depend on federal support to allocate funds effectively, the impending staff reductions could hinder their ability to plan and implement educational programs. Overall, the cuts threaten the stability of educational funding for vulnerable populations across the country.
