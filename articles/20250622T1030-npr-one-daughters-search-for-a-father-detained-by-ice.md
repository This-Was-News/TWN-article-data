## Article summary
Nancy Urizar is on a frantic search for her father, Francisco Urizar, who was detained by ICE while working in Pico Rivera, California. Videos show agents surrounding his delivery truck before taking him away, leaving Nancy desperate for answers about why he was targeted. She recently viewed a friend's video of the incident, which provided some timeline details but raised more questions about the nature of his arrest. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to inquiries about his detention status or any warrants. Nancy reflects on her father's long journey to the U.S., having fled Guatemala's civil war and previously applied for asylum. She has been searching for his A-number to locate him in the ICE system but has found no results more than 48 hours post-arrest. The uncertainty of her father's situation weighs heavily on her, causing her distress and guilt. Friends and community members have been supportive, but Nancy feels the pain of the situation deeply. She expresses her disbelief that such a thing could happen to her family, a sentiment shared by many in her community amidst increased immigration enforcement in the area.
