## Article summary
The recent attack on demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, has heightened anxiety among American Jews, particularly as it follows other violent incidents linked to anti-Israel sentiment. The Boulder attack, which resulted in eight hospitalizations, was preceded by the shooting of two Israeli Embassy employees and an arson attack on the Pennsylvania governor's mansion. Jewish leaders express concern over a pattern of antisemitic violence, noting that the recent incidents reflect a broader trend of hostility linked to the conflict in Gaza. The Anti-Defamation League reported a record number of antisemitic episodes in 2023, with many Jews feeling increasingly unsafe in public. Activists highlight that dangerous rhetoric surrounding the war has escalated tensions, even within local political arenas. Surveys indicate that a significant majority of American Jews perceive rising antisemitism, with many having experienced antisemitic remarks or attacks. While right-wing extremism remains a major threat, the current climate complicates the distinction between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. Jewish organizations emphasize the need to condemn any targeting of Jews in the context of protests against Israeli actions. The Trump administration has prioritized combating antisemitism, yet critics argue that some of its actions undermine this commitment. Overall, the situation reflects a growing concern for the safety and security of Jewish communities across the United States.
