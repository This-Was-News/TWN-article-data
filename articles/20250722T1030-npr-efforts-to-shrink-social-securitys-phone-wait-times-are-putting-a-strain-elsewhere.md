## Article summary
The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reassigned some field office employees to reduce wait times for its national 800 phone number, but this has increased workload and stress for remaining staff and may be harming other services. Experts argue that the SSA's staffing levels are insufficient to meet demand, with thousands of employees leaving the agency in recent months. While the SSA reports improved phone service, frontline workers say the reassignments have forced them to take on more work and are preventing them from properly serving the public. The SSA's decision to remove real-time metrics from its website makes it difficult to track performance in other areas. Despite the SSA's efforts, policy experts and workers argue that hiring more staff is necessary to improve services and working conditions.
