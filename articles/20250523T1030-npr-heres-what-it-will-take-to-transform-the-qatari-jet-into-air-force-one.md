## Article summary
The Qatari Boeing 747-8, gifted to the U.S. by Qatar, is set to undergo extensive modifications to become the next Air Force One for President Trump. Although Trump claims the plane is a generous gift to the Department of Defense, critics argue it violates the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. Experts believe transforming the luxury jet into a secure presidential aircraft will take years and significant investment, potentially costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Current Air Force One planes, in use since 1990, are being replaced by new Boeing 747-8 models, which are more advanced and secure. The gifted plane, while opulent, lacks the necessary communications and defense systems that Air Force One requires. Concerns have been raised about potential security risks, including the possibility of malware, given the plane's foreign history. The modifications needed to meet Air Force One standards are extensive, and experts caution against rushing the process. The transition from a luxury jet to a secure presidential transport is complex, with significant implications for national security. The project has drawn skepticism over its costs and the potential for it being a vanity project for Trump. Overall, the efforts to convert the Qatari jet highlight the challenges of balancing luxury with the stringent security requirements of the presidential aircraft.
