## Article summary
After President Trump announced extensive global tariffs, the U.S. faced immediate backlash as China retaliated with a 34 percent tariff on American goods, exacerbating fears of a trade war. Financial markets reacted negatively, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experiencing significant declines, edging closer to bear market territory. The World Trade Organization's director general warned about the dangers of escalating retaliatory measures, while the Federal Reserve chair noted the potential for larger-than-expected economic impacts, including inflation and slower growth. Despite the turmoil, Trump remained defiant, asserting that his policies were effective and that the market chaos was a necessary step to force the Fed to lower interest rates. He criticized China's response, claiming they "played it wrong," and suggested that tariffs could be increased further if other nations retaliated. The tariffs are seen as a strategy to recalibrate global trade relationships, but they risk hurting businesses and consumers through increased costs. Economists expressed concerns that these policies could weaken the global economy and lead to an overall contraction in trade volumes. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom indicated a willingness to negotiate independent trade deals to protect local interests. Amidst this, even companies like Nintendo announced delays in product releases due to the uncertain impact of the tariffs.
