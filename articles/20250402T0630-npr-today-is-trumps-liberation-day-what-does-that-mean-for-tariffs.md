## Article summary
On April 2, 2025, President Trump is expected to announce new "reciprocal tariffs" aimed at penalizing countries that impose trade barriers on U.S. goods. Dubbed "Liberation Day," the initiative is intended to generate revenue for tax cuts and reduce the deficit while promoting U.S. manufacturing. However, economists warn that these tariffs could lead to increased prices for American consumers, with projections estimating annual costs between $2,700 and $3,400 per household. The stock market has reacted negatively, with the S&P 500 experiencing its worst quarterly performance since 2022 and consumer confidence reaching a 12-year low.

Trump's approach has been criticized for its vagueness and unpredictability, with few details provided on which countries or products will be affected. Although he has previously stated that tariffs would reflect what other nations charge, he has recently softened his tone, suggesting that U.S. tariffs may be lower than those imposed by other countries. Experts argue that a more targeted approach would be more effective than the broad measures currently proposed. The announcement has raised concerns about potential retaliation from affected countries, particularly impacting U.S. farmers and exporters. Overall, the uncertainty surrounding these tariffs continues to create economic turmoil.
