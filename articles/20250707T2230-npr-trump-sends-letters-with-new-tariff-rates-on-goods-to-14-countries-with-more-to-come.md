## Article summary
President Trump has informed the leaders of 14 countries about new tariffs on their exports to the U.S., set to begin on August 1. An executive order has also extended the deadline for trade deals from July 9 to August 1. The new tariffs range from 25% to 40%, with countries like Laos and Myanmar facing some of the highest rates. Trump justified these tariffs by highlighting the U.S. trade deficit with these nations and stating that their goods could avoid the tariffs if produced in the U.S. The letters sent to the countries are similar in content, differing only in the specified tariffs. The White House clarified that these new tariffs are not in addition to existing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump's approach to tariffs has been characterized as unorthodox, utilizing social media for announcements and favoring bilateral deals over multilateral agreements. While the potential benefits include reduced trade barriers for U.S. exporters, the immediate costs will likely be passed on to consumers, resulting in higher prices for imported goods. Overall, Trump's tariff strategy reflects a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, emphasizing quick negotiations and retaliatory measures.
