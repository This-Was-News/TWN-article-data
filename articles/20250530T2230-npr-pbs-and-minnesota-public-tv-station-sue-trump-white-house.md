## Article summary
PBS and Lakeland PBS, a Minnesota public television station, have filed a lawsuit against President Trump following his executive order to cut federal funding for PBS. The lawsuit claims that Trump's order is unlawful, violates free speech protections, and is an attempt to influence PBS's programming due to the president's dissatisfaction with its news coverage. PBS President Paula Kerger emphasized the need to protect the editorial independence of public television. The White House defended the order, asserting it is within the president's authority to limit funding to media perceived as biased. The executive order bans the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from distributing funds to PBS and NPR, which could result in PBS losing $81 million annually in federal grants. Lakeland PBS, which heavily relies on federal funding, argues that the order threatens its existence as it provides essential local programming. The lawsuit follows similar legal action by NPR and other public radio stations. Additionally, Congress is preparing to consider a request from Trump to rescind $1.1 billion allocated for public broadcasting over the next two years. The situation raises significant concerns about the future of public media and its funding.
