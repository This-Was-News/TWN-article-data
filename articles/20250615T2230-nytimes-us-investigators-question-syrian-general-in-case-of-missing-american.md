## Article summary
A former top Syrian general, Bassam Hassan, has revealed to U.S. investigators that missing American journalist Austin Tice is dead and provided a possible grave location. Hassan, who was a close adviser to ousted President Bashar al-Assad and is implicated in chemical weapons attacks, claimed that al-Assad ordered Tice's killing after he was kidnapped in 2012. The U.S. has long sought information about Tice's fate, hoping he might have survived Syria's brutal prison system. However, skepticism surrounds Hassan's testimony, as former officials express concerns he may be attempting to deflect blame onto al-Assad. The Tice family remains doubtful about Hassan's account, believing it to be false and unhelpful in their search for Austin. Despite the collapse of al-Assad's regime, American diplomatic efforts and intelligence operations have failed to yield solid leads on Tice's whereabouts. Tice, a former Marine, was abducted in a Damascus suburb and appeared in a video weeks later, blindfolded and with armed captors. Reports have surfaced suggesting he may have been held by Iran-backed paramilitary forces. The ongoing investigation by the FBI and CIA continues, as officials remain committed to uncovering the truth behind Tice's disappearance.
