## Article summary
The military partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine has evolved significantly, particularly prior to President Trump's return to power. A New York Times investigation reveals that the collaboration involved not only the provision of $66.5 billion in weaponry but also deep intelligence and strategic support. Key to this partnership was Task Force Dragon, based in Wiesbaden, Germany, which provided Ukrainian forces with precise targeting information on Russian units. This cooperation helped Ukraine turn the tide against the Russian invasion, particularly with the introduction of High Mobility Artillery Systems (HIMARS) in 2022, leading to substantial Russian casualties and a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive.

The Biden administration navigated complex red lines regarding U.S. involvement, gradually allowing military advisers in Ukraine and sharing intelligence for drone strikes against Russian assets. Operations like Operation Lunar Hail targeted Russian military installations in Crimea, and U.S. support even extended to strikes within Russian territory under certain conditions. However, political disagreements within Ukraine hampered the 2023 counteroffensive, as conflicting strategies led to a divided focus and ultimately a failure to reclaim key territories.
