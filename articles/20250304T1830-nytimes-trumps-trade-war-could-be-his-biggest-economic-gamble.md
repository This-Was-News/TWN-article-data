## Article summary
President Trump has initiated significant tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, marking a major gamble that could destabilize the U.S. economy. These tariffs, set at 25% for Canada and Mexico and 10% for China, have triggered a trade war and raised concerns among businesses and economists about their potential negative impacts. Trump's rationale for the tariffs includes claims of punishing countries for not controlling drug trafficking and encouraging domestic manufacturing. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticized the tariffs as an attempt to cripple Canada’s economy, while Canada has announced retaliatory tariffs on $20.5 billion worth of U.S. goods.

The tariffs have already caused stock market declines and raised fears of rising consumer prices, with estimates suggesting households could face an additional $1,000 in annual costs. Economists warn that prolonged tariffs could lower U.S. economic growth by one percentage point. While some domestic industries may benefit, the overall sentiment among business groups is one of concern, with many considering legal challenges against the tariffs. The situation has prompted Canada and Mexico to seek alternative trade partners, further complicating the trade landscape. The long-term economic effects remain uncertain, with potential repercussions for both the U.S. and its trading partners.
