## Article summary
The House of Representatives is poised to vote on legislation aimed at rescinding two years of federal funding for public media outlets, including NPR and PBS, as requested by President Trump. This initiative is part of a broader effort to cut $9.4 billion in federal spending, with significant reductions targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. Trump's administration has labeled NPR and PBS as ideologically biased, prompting GOP leaders to align with this sentiment, despite some Republicans expressing support for local public stations. 

Historically, funding for public media has faced challenges, with Republicans frequently advocating for cuts since the 1990s. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was established in 1967 to oversee federal grants to public media, and figures like Fred Rogers have historically defended its funding. Currently, public broadcasting represents a minimal portion of the federal budget, yet its impact is significant across congressional districts. 

As the House prepares for the vote, grassroots campaigns have mobilized over two million messages urging lawmakers to oppose the funding cuts. If the House passes the rescission package, it will move to the Senate, where a simple majority is needed for approval within a 45-day timeframe. Failure to act by mid-July would result in the release of the previously allocated funds.
