## Article summary
Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group, has seen its power diminish since its recent war with Israel. Despite this, it resists calls to surrender its remaining weapons. The group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which triggered a broader conflict. Hezbollah's future is uncertain as it faces pressure to disarm after decades of operating as a state within a state. The group's power is now significantly reduced, with its leadership eliminated during the recent war.
