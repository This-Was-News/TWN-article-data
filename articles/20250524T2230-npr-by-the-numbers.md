## Article summary
The web page discusses the significant role of international students at Harvard and across the U.S., particularly in light of a lawsuit against the Trump administration aimed at limiting their enrollment. Harvard emphasized that without these students, it would lose its identity as a leading institution. The total number of international students in U.S. colleges reached a record high of over 1.1 million for the 2023-2024 academic year, marking a 7% increase from the previous year. India and China are the top two countries sending students, accounting for more than half of the international student population. 

These students contribute approximately $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and support over 378,000 jobs. At Harvard, nearly 7,000 international students represent over 25% of the total enrollment, with the number exceeding 10,000 when including scholars and researchers. International students also make a notable impact in athletics, with around 21% of Harvard's varsity athletes being from abroad. The university has hosted international students under the F-1 visa program for 70 years, reflecting a broader trend among U.S. educational institutions. The page underscores the importance of international students in enhancing global relationships and economic contributions.
