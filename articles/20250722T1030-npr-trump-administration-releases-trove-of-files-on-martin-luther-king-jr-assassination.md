## Article summary
The Trump administration released a large collection of declassified documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The release, following an executive order from President Trump, includes over 230,000 files, detailing the FBI's investigation, potential leads, and information about the convicted assassin, James Earl Ray. The documents also highlight the FBI's surveillance and disinformation campaign against King, as noted by his family, who emphasized the need to view the files within their historical context. King's family expressed support for transparency but objected to any attempts to weaponize the information or attack his legacy. The release comes amid pressure on the administration to declassify additional records, including those related to Jeffrey Epstein, and follows a previous release of documents on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
