## Article summary
The document discusses recent diplomatic efforts to halt the war in Ukraine, with faint signs of progress emerging. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed renewed talks, including a cease-fire, prisoner exchanges, and the return of deported children, and reiterated an offer for a direct meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has not directly responded to Ukraine's offer but has stated its desire for a peace agreement that achieves its war goals. The Trump administration has pushed for an unconditional cease-fire and has facilitated weapons transfers to Ukraine while threatening sanctions on Russia's trading partners. Despite these efforts, the war continues with Russia intensifying its attacks, and there is little hope for a quick resolution.
