## Article summary
Israel claims to have gained control over Iranian airspace, conducting extensive airstrikes using advanced F-35 fighters against Iran's air defenses and nuclear sites without losing any aircraft. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu highlighted a successful intelligence operation that has reportedly allowed Israel a "free highway to Tehran," significantly degrading Iran's air defense capabilities. Despite Israel's assertions, some Iranian missiles continue to penetrate defenses, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure. The primary targets of Israel's operations are the Natanz and Fordow uranium enrichment facilities, which pose significant challenges due to their underground locations. While Israel's missile defense systems, particularly Iron Dome, have proven effective against many incoming threats, they still face challenges from waves of Iranian missiles. Iran's missile attacks have led to notable casualties, including the deaths of eight Israeli civilians. Israel has also targeted and destroyed a significant portion of Iran's mobile missile launchers, which are difficult to locate due to their ability to hide and relocate. The ongoing conflict underscores the complexities of aerial warfare in the region, with both sides adapting their strategies in response to the evolving situation. Overall, the conflict highlights the precarious balance of power and the persistent threat posed by Iran's missile capabilities.
