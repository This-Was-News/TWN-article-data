## Article summary
Israel and Iran engaged in deadly strikes as their conflict entered its fourth day, escalating fears of a broader regional war. The Israel Defense Forces reported targeting command centers of Iran's Quds Force, part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, following a surprise attack aimed at Iran's nuclear capabilities. In response, Iranian missile and drone strikes hit Tel Aviv and Haifa, resulting in at least eight Israeli casualties and nearly 100 injuries. A missile struck a residential building in Petah Tikvah, killing four elderly residents. Additionally, one missile caused minor damage to the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv without injuring personnel. Despite international calls for de-escalation, both nations showed no willingness to negotiate. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the need to eliminate threats to Israel's survival rather than pursuing a ceasefire. Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned that future strikes would be more severe and precise. Former President Trump suggested that a deal between Iran and Israel could be beneficial, although he acknowledged that sometimes conflicts must be resolved through fighting. The ongoing exchanges raise concerns about the potential for increased violence in the region.
