## Article summary
Nancy Urizar is desperately searching for her father, Francisco Urizar, who was detained by ICE while working in Pico Rivera, California. The 64-year-old was taken away by agents in a dramatic incident captured on video, which Nancy has been reviewing in hopes of understanding the circumstances of his arrest. She questions whether her father was specifically targeted or if it was a random enforcement action. Despite her efforts, the Department of Homeland Security has not provided information about his detention status. Francisco Urizar fled Guatemala 35 years ago to escape violence and initially sought asylum but later abandoned the process due to financial constraints. Nancy is struggling with feelings of guilt and anxiety as she cannot locate her father in the ICE Online Detainee Locator System. She expresses her frustration over the lack of answers and the emotional toll of the situation, feeling haunted by her father's fear. Friends from the supermarket have been supportive, but Nancy's pain is profound, as she realizes the harsh reality of immigration enforcement. The case highlights the increased immigration enforcement actions occurring in Los Angeles and the personal impact on families involved.
