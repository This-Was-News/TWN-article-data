## Article summary
North Carolina is facing significant Medicaid cuts due to a recent bill passed by Congress, which jeopardizes the reopening of Martin General Hospital in Martin County. The hospital closed in 2023, but local residents hoped to partially reopen it following Medicaid expansion that provided coverage for low-income adults. However, the new legislation threatens to end Medicaid expansion, potentially leaving hundreds of thousands without coverage and worsening rural healthcare access. Health experts warn that the cuts could lead to millions more uninsured Americans, with North Carolina particularly affected.

Local leaders express deep concern over the impact of losing Medicaid, highlighting the dire situation for residents who rely on the nearest hospital, which is a 30-minute drive away. The bill also imposes work verification requirements on Medicaid recipients, which could further complicate access to care. Although Congress allocated $50 billion for rural hospitals, many believe it won't compensate for the Medicaid cuts. Community members share personal stories of loss and the urgent need for medical services, emphasizing that the absence of local healthcare is a life-and-death issue. The future of Martin General and similar facilities hangs in the balance as state officials and hospital leaders grapple with the implications of the new law.
