## Article summary
TikTok creators in the U.S. are experiencing emotional turmoil due to the uncertainty surrounding the app's future, particularly following President Trump's decision to extend the sale deadline for TikTok's U.S. operations. This uncertainty stems from a federal law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. operations, leading to feelings of sadness and fear among creators. Many have expressed their distress in videos, likening the potential ban to losing a close friend. As the situation evolves, creators are shifting from despair to a sense of resignation, often characterized by a "whatever" attitude. 

Experts suggest that the fatigue felt by creators reflects broader societal stressors, including the pandemic and divisive politics, which contribute to feelings of helplessness and uncertainty. To cope with this emotional exhaustion, mental health professionals recommend connecting with supportive communities and taking breaks from the platform. They emphasize the importance of resilience and recalling past experiences of uncertainty to navigate the current challenges. Overall, TikTok creators are grappling with the complexities of their emotional responses amidst ongoing political negotiations affecting their livelihoods.
