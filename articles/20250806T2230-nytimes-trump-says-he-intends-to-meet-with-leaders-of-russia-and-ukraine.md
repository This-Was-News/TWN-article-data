## Article summary
President Trump plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the coming weeks. These meetings, which would be one-on-one, aim to discuss ending the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Trump disclosed these plans during a call with European leaders, including Zelensky. While some European leaders expressed skepticism, they accepted Trump's plans. The proposed summit would be the first in-person meeting between an American and Russian president in over four years. Trump believes his persuasive abilities can help strike a deal, despite past failures in similar diplomatic efforts. Putin has expressed willingness to meet with Trump, while Zelensky has indicated that a direct meeting is possible but cautioned against deception. Trump has been working towards a peace agreement but has also authorized more arms sales to NATO allies for Ukraine. Meanwhile, he has threatened secondary sanctions against Russia and signed an order to double tariffs on imports from India due to its continued purchases of Russian oil.
