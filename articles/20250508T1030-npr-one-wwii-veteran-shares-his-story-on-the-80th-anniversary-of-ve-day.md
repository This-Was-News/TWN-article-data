## Article summary
On the 80th anniversary of VE Day, 96-year-old Harry Miller, a veteran of the Army and Air Force, shared his experiences from World War II. He was in Schwerin, Germany, when the Allied forces received news of Germany's unconditional surrender on May 7, 1945. Miller, who joined the Army at just 15, participated in significant battles, including the Battle of the Bulge, where his unit famously halted the advance of the 1st SS Panzer Division. He reflected on the camaraderie formed with fellow soldiers and the importance of humor in coping with the war's seriousness. After the war, Miller visited concentration camps, which left a lasting emotional impact on him. He continued his military service through the Korean and Vietnam Wars, retiring as a senior master sergeant in 1966. Today, he shares his story to emphasize the futility of war, hoping to inspire others to prevent future conflicts. Miller believes that nations can thrive in peace, as evidenced by the recovery of Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and Korea after their respective wars.
