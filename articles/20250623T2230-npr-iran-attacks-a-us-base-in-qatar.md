## Article summary
Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. bases in Qatar and Iraq, specifically targeting Al Udeid Air Base, according to Iran's state-run news agency Tasnim. A U.S. defense official confirmed the attack involved short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles from Iran but reported no U.S. casualties. Qatar's air defenses intercepted the missiles, and President Trump acknowledged that Iran had given advance notice of the strikes, which he deemed a weak response to prior U.S. actions against Iran's nuclear facilities. The attack occurred shortly after Qatar closed its airspace and the U.S. Embassy advised American nationals to shelter in place. Qatar's Foreign Ministry condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and international law, asserting the right to respond proportionally. UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed alarm over the escalating conflict and called for all parties to cease military actions. The situation remains under close monitoring as further developments unfold.
