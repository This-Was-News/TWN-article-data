## Article summary
China closely monitors the Israel-Iran tensions due to its significant economic ties with Iran, being the largest importer of Iranian oil. Despite U.S. sanctions aimed at restricting Iran's oil sales, China continues to purchase around 90% of Iran's crude oil, often at discounted rates. This relationship is crucial for both nations, as China aims to ensure the survival of the Iranian regime, which it views as a strategic partner. The oil is transported using a "dark fleet" of ships that operate outside official channels, with crude often relabeled to obscure its origin. Political influence allows China to navigate the complexities of this trade, despite lacking military capacity in the region. 

While China could source oil from other countries like Russia or Venezuela, doing so would incur higher costs and impact its refining operations. Smaller, privately-owned "teapot" refineries in China are particularly reliant on Iranian oil due to its lower price, but the Chinese government has been trying to reduce excess refining capacity. Currently, China has stockpiled approximately 1.1 billion barrels of oil, providing it with a buffer as it navigates potential disruptions from the ongoing conflict. Overall, the dynamics of the Israel-Iran situation significantly affect China's energy strategy and regional influence.
