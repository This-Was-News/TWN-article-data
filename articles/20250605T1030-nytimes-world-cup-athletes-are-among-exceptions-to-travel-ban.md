## Article summary
President Trump has enacted a travel ban that restricts entry to the United States for citizens from 12 countries, primarily located in Africa and the Middle East. The countries affected by the ban include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. However, there are notable exceptions to the ban. Green card holders and dual citizens are exempt, allowing them to enter the U.S. without restriction. Immigrants seeking visas through U.S. family members, certain athletes traveling for major sporting events, and refugees granted asylum also fall outside the ban's limitations. Additionally, Afghans who assisted the U.S. during its military involvement and Iranians fleeing religious persecution are allowed entry. The administration has clarified these exemptions in the order to avoid confusion similar to that experienced during a previous travel ban in 2017. The new restrictions will take effect on Monday.
