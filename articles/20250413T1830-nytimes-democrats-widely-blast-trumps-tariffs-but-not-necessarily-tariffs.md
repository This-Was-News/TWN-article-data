## Article summary
Democrats are vocally critical of President Trump's tariff policies, labeling them as chaotic and reckless, yet they struggle to present a unified stance on tariffs as a broader policy tool. During recent interviews, Democratic lawmakers faced scrutiny over their opposition to Trump's tariffs while some members of the party support tariffs in principle. Senator Cory Booker condemned Trump's tariffs for negatively impacting the economy but refrained from commenting on the party's overall approach. Conversely, some Democrats, like Representative Jared Golden, have endorsed specific tariffs, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer expressed understanding for Trump's motivations. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the inconsistency in Trump's tariff strategy but acknowledged that tariffs can be useful when applied strategically. The Democratic leadership aims to criticize Trump's tactics while keeping the possibility of using tariffs in future strategies open. This mixed messaging has caused frustration among some party members, who believe it undermines their position against Trump. Representative Ritchie Torres emphasized the need for clear opposition to Trump's tariff weaponization. Overall, while Democrats condemn Trump's chaotic tariff strategy, they are divided on tariffs as a policy tool moving forward.
