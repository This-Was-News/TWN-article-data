## Article summary
The article discusses concerns among infectious disease doctors regarding Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s response to a measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico, which has resulted in two confirmed deaths. Doctors worry that Kennedy's emphasis on treatments like vitamin A and nutrition may overshadow the critical importance of vaccination. In his editorial, Kennedy acknowledged the value of vaccinations but framed the decision to vaccinate as a personal choice, which has raised alarm among health experts. They argue that the primary message should focus on increasing vaccination rates to effectively combat the outbreak.

Kennedy suggested that vitamin A could significantly reduce mortality from measles, a claim that has faced skepticism from medical professionals who stress that vaccination remains the best preventive measure. They caution against misinformation suggesting that nutrition can replace vaccination, noting potential dangers of excessive vitamin A intake. Experts emphasize that while vitamin A can help in specific cases, it does not prevent measles. The article highlights the need for clear public health messaging that prioritizes vaccination to protect against the highly contagious disease.
