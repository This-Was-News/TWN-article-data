## Article summary
President Trump signed a travel ban affecting citizens from 12 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, which will take effect on Monday. The countries included are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The ban aims to curb immigration from nations deemed to have a significant presence of terrorists and those lacking proper vetting processes. In addition, partial restrictions were placed on travel from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Some exceptions to the ban include green card holders, dual citizens, certain athletes, and Afghan nationals who assisted the U.S. government. The decision revives a controversial policy from Trump's first term and is likely to face legal scrutiny, although experts suggest it may withstand challenges due to prior lessons learned. Critics argue that the ban discriminates based on ethnicity and undermines the U.S. values of welcoming those in need. The announcement followed a recent attack in Colorado, which Trump cited as justification for the ban. Overall, the travel restrictions raise concerns about the impact on vulnerable populations seeking refuge in the U.S.
