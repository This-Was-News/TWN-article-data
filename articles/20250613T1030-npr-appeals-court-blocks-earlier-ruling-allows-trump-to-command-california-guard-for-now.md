## Article summary
An appeals court has temporarily blocked a federal judge's ruling that ordered President Trump to relinquish control of the California National Guard, allowing him to maintain command until a hearing can be held. The judge had previously determined that Trump's actions violated the U.S. Constitution by exceeding his authority and infringing on state powers. The situation arises as Trump federalized the California Guard and deployed additional U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, citing attempts to impede immigration enforcement as justification. This marks the first instance in 60 years where a president has activated a state's National Guard against the governor's wishes. California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed plans to return the Guard to their regular duties, praising the initial ruling as a pushback against presidential overreach. White House officials contested the ruling, asserting that the President has the lawful authority to mobilize the National Guard. The appeals court's decision means the legal battle over this unprecedented command will continue, with a hearing scheduled for later. The judge's ruling did not directly address the Marines' deployment, which remains ambiguous. Newsom maintained confidence in the legal process and the Constitution, despite the appeals court's hold on the earlier ruling.
