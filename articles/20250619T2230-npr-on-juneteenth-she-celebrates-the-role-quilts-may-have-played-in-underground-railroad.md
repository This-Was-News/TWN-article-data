## Article summary
Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilt maker, connects her craft to the Black struggle for freedom, particularly on Juneteenth. Having started sewing at age seven, she discovered the historical significance of quilts in the Underground Railroad 50 years ago, learning that they contained encoded messages for escaping enslaved people. These quilts, often displayed outdoors, provided vital information for those planning to flee. While some academics doubt the existence of such coded messages due to a lack of written evidence, others defend the idea, suggesting that secrecy would naturally prevent documentation. Edith and her daughter, Amy, explore this history, inspired by the book "Hidden in Plain View," which decodes quilt patterns used for communication. As Juneteenth gains recognition, Edith emphasizes the importance of educating younger generations about the Underground Railroad. She aims to raise awareness about the struggles of enslaved people and the role quilts may have played in their fight for freedom. Through her work, she hopes to inspire others and keep the stories of her ancestors alive.
