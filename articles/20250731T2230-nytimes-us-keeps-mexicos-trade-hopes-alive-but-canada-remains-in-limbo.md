## Article summary
The United States and Mexico agreed to extend trade negotiations for 90 days, averting higher tariffs that were set to begin. This decision came after months of negotiations and a phone call between President Trump and President Claudia Shenbaum of Mexico. While Mexico expressed optimism, Canada felt uncertainty as Trump's announcement did not mention them and followed his criticism of Canada's support for Palestinian statehood. The current 25% tariff on Mexican goods not covered by the USMCA will remain, and Mexico has agreed to remove other trade barriers. Trump has made various demands of Mexico, including efforts to combat drug cartels and reduce the flow of fentanyl and migrants.
