A gunman armed with an assault-style rifle entered a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper on Monday evening, killing a New York City police officer, three other individuals, and critically injuring a fifth before taking his own life. Three victims were shot in the building's lobby, while the fourth was killed on an upper floor. The gunman then shot himself in the chest.
