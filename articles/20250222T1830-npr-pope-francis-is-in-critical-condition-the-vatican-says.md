## Article summary
Pope Francis is currently in critical condition due to a complex lung infection and pneumonia, as reported by the Vatican. The 88-year-old pontiff has been hospitalized for a week and is receiving high flows of oxygen, along with blood transfusions due to anemia. Despite his serious health issues, he remains alert and spent time in an armchair, although he is experiencing increased pain. Doctors have indicated that the prognosis is uncertain, with the main concern being the risk of sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication. 

Francis was admitted to the hospital after a worsening bronchitis episode and has been diagnosed with a combination of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. His medical team has prescribed a regimen of cortisone, antibiotics, and supplemental oxygen. The Vatican continues its Holy Year celebrations in his absence, as he was scheduled to participate in significant events. While he knows he is in danger, the pope has expressed a desire for prayers and support from his followers. Recovery is expected to be slow, and he will need to manage his chronic respiratory issues moving forward.
