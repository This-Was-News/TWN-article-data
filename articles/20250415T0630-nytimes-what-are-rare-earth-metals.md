## Article summary
The web page discusses the significance of rare earth metals, which are crucial for various industries, including technology, energy, and transportation. There are 17 types of rare earths, categorized into heavy and light metals, with neodymium and praseodymium being particularly important for magnet production. China's control over rare earth exports poses a threat to American manufacturing and military capabilities, especially as the U.S. has seen a decline in its own production, now relying on a single operational mine in California for only 15 percent of global supply. Historically, the U.S. was a leader in rare earth production, but this has changed dramatically due to China's dominance, which now accounts for nearly 70 percent of the market and produces 90 percent of rare earth magnets. The geopolitical implications of rare earths are evident, as the U.S. has sought to secure resources from other countries like Ukraine and Greenland. China's potential restrictions on rare earth exports could severely impact American industries, including automotive and technology sectors, leading to shortages of critical components like drones and semiconductors. Companies have begun stockpiling rare earths in anticipation of trade tensions, but the longevity of these supplies remains uncertain. The consolidation of China's rare earth industry under state control further solidifies its grip on the global market.
