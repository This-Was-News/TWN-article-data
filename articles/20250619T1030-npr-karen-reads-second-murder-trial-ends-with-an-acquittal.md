## Article summary
Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder in her second trial concerning the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, who died in January 2022 after allegedly being struck by Read's SUV. The jury found her guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence, leading to a one-year probation sentence. Read's defense argued that O'Keefe was killed by fellow law enforcement officers and that evidence was tampered with to frame her. The prosecution claimed that Read intentionally reversed her car, leaving O'Keefe to die in the snow. This trial followed a previous mistrial, where jurors could not reach a unanimous decision.

The case drew significant media attention, with various witnesses and forensic experts testifying. Read maintained her innocence, stating that she could not have hit O'Keefe. The defense highlighted flaws in the police investigation and questioned the credibility of key witnesses. Throughout the trial, Read's supporters rallied outside the courthouse, celebrating her acquittal. After the verdict, Read expressed gratitude for her supporters and reiterated her commitment to seeking justice for O'Keefe.
