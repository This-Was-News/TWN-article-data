## Article summary
The Ph.D. Project, which has supported underrepresented students in earning doctoral degrees in business for nearly 30 years, is currently under investigation by the Trump administration along with 45 colleges. The U.S. Education Department claims these institutions, including Ivy League schools, are violating the Civil Rights Act by partnering with the Ph.D. Project, which allegedly engages in "race-exclusionary practices." This scrutiny aligns with President Trump's broader crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education. 

In response to the federal investigation, some universities have severed ties with the Ph.D. Project, fearing repercussions such as loss of federal funding. The nonprofit has adapted by broadening its mission statement to include a wider range of applicants, moving away from a focus solely on diversity. Alumni of the Ph.D. Project emphasize the program's role in helping them navigate academia without providing unfair advantages based on race. 

The investigation stems from an online tip line launched by the administration for reporting perceived discrimination in educational institutions. The Ph.D. Project's leadership remains optimistic about its future, believing that it can continue to positively impact aspiring scholars despite the challenges posed by the current political climate.
