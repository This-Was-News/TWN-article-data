## Article summary
A federal judge, James E. Boasberg, expressed frustration with the Trump administration over insufficient information regarding deportation flights of Venezuelans. He is considering holding the administration in contempt for potentially violating his ruling that paused the deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The judge demanded an explanation from the administration for allowing two flights to proceed to El Salvador despite his order to return them to the U.S. He criticized the Justice Department for evading his requests for detailed flight information, labeling their recent filings as inadequate. As tensions rise, the administration has faced accusations of overstepping judicial authority while asserting that the deported individuals are linked to a violent gang. Lawyers for the deported argue that many of their clients are not gang members and should be allowed to prove their innocence. The case raises concerns about the balance of power between the executive branch and judicial oversight, with potential implications for constitutional authority. Judge Boasberg's directives include a sworn declaration from involved officials and a deadline for the Justice Department to clarify its intentions regarding the state secrets privilege. The conflict highlights ongoing legal battles over immigration enforcement and presidential powers.
