## Article summary
The United States voted against a U.N. resolution that demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, marking a significant divide between the U.S. and its European allies. In contrast, the U.S. secured approval for its own resolution in the U.N. Security Council that called for peace without assigning blame for the conflict. This development coincided with the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and showcased a shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump. The U.S. resolution, which did not mention Russian aggression, faced criticism from allies like Britain and France, who emphasized the need to hold Russia accountable for its actions.

The U.N. General Assembly had previously approved Ukraine's resolution by a significant margin, while the U.S. resolution was ultimately passed in the Security Council with abstentions from key allies. European diplomats expressed frustration over the U.S. decision to introduce its own resolution without consulting them, highlighting a notable rift in transatlantic relations. The U.S. representative argued that previous resolutions condemning Russia had failed to alter the course of the war, which has resulted in substantial loss of life. The clash at the U.N. is seen as a historic moment that could redefine alliances and approaches to security in Europe.
