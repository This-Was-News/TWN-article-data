## Article summary
President Trump has nominated retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Dan "Razin" Caine as the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Caine, a career fighter jet pilot, is known for patrolling the skies over Washington, D.C., during the 9/11 attacks and has served in various capacities, including at the CIA. His nomination follows the recent dismissal of the previous chairman, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., amid criticisms regarding military leadership and perceived "woke" agendas. Caine's background is notable, as he has not held the typical positions usually required for this role, but Trump has the authority to waive such requirements in the national interest.

Caine's military career includes significant combat experience and leadership roles in the fight against ISIS in the Middle East. He is also recognized as a "serial entrepreneur" and has been involved with several venture capital firms. Trump's admiration for Caine dates back to their meeting in Iraq, where Caine impressed Trump with his insights on defeating the Islamic State. Caine's nomination represents a shift in Pentagon leadership, emphasizing a focus on military effectiveness and core missions.
