## Article summary
A shooter opened fire on a Minneapolis church filled with children and worshippers during a Mass to mark the first week of school, killing two children and wounding 17 others. The shooter, identified as Robin Westman, 23, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Authorities recovered additional firearms at three residences linked to the shooter. The motive remains undetermined, but the FBI will investigate the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. The shooting occurred just before 8:30 a.m. near the start of Mass at Annunciation Catholic School, adjacent to the church. Westman used a rifle, shotgun, and pistol to fire through the church windows. Staff members quickly moved students under the pews for safety. Two children, ages 8 and 10, were killed, and 17 others were injured, including three elderly parishioners and 14 children. All injured victims are expected to recover. Westman had legally purchased the guns and left writings and YouTube videos connected to the attack, including references to past mass shooters and drawings of a church sanctuary. Westman's mother previously served at the church where the shooting took place.
