## Article summary
The Trump administration awarded a $1.2 billion contract to Acquston Logstcs LLC, a small company with no experience in running detention facilities, to build and operate a massive immigration detention camp at Fort Bliss in Texas. The Pentagon has refused to release details about the contract or explain why Acquston Logstcs was chosen over other bidders. The camp, expected to house up to 5,000 migrants, has raised concerns about the company's qualifications and the lack of transparency in the contract process. The facility is part of the administration's broader push to arrest and deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status. Critics have expressed worries about the potential for abuse and neglect, especially given the remote location and limited oversight. The use of military bases for detention has drawn comparisons to historical injustices, such as the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The contract specifies that the contractor is responsible for security and medical care, and requires strict secrecy. A losing bidder has filed a protest challenging the award, alleging that Acquston Logstcs lacks the necessary experience and resources. The Government Accountability Office is expected to rule on the protest by November, with a legal appeal also pending.
