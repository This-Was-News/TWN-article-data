## Article summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is facing turmoil as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaces Director Susan Monarez with Jim O'Neill, who lacks a medical background. Monarez, a longtime scientist, was ousted for not aligning with President Donald Trump's agenda and refused to endorse unsupported policies. Three senior officials resigned in protest, citing concerns over political interference and the potential harm to public health, particularly regarding vaccination policies. Kennedy's reshaping of a key advisory committee with vaccine skeptics has sparked bipartisan alarm and calls for congressional oversight. The CDC has struggled with leadership vacancies and political controversies, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Monarez's departure could make her the shortest-serving director in CDC history. Kennedy's actions have raised concerns about the integrity of scientific processes and the safety of vaccination programs, with critics warning of potential risks to children's health.
