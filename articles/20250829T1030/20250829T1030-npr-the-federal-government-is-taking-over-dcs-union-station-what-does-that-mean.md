## Article summary
The federal government is taking over management of Washington, D.C.'s Union Station, a major transportation hub and national landmark. The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it will reclaim management of the station, with changes expected to be formalized in September. The DOT has owned the building since the 1980s but had outsourced its daily operations to a local nonprofit, the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation. Amtrak took over these responsibilities last summer. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that Union Station has fallen into disrepair and that federal management will help make the city safer and more beautiful at a fraction of the cost. Union Station serves multiple train lines and over 70,000 passengers daily, with dozens of shops and restaurants. The announcement follows a visit by Vice President Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who described the station as unsafe. While violent crime has declined citywide, several incidents have been reported at Union Station this year. The DOT plans to address the station's infrastructure needs, including replacing the roof and improving security, and aims to maximize its commercial revenue. The department has shelved a previous expansion plan due to its high cost and unrealistic elements, focusing instead on immediate needs before considering future expansion.
