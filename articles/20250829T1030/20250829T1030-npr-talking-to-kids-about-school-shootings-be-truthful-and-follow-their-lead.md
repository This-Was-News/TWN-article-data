## Article summary
The article discusses how to talk to children about school shootings, emphasizing the importance of being truthful and following their lead. School shootings have increased sharply in recent years, with 44 incidents this year alone. Parents and teachers struggle to calm children's anxieties after such events. Experts like David Schonfeld recommend asking children what they've heard and tailoring responses to their specific concerns. Honest answers help build trust, even if it means acknowledging inherent risks. A child's age, past trauma, and connection to the event influence how much information to share. Patience and repeated conversations are crucial, as is maintaining routines to provide a sense of security. Limiting media exposure and focusing on constructive actions, such as advocating for gun control, can also help. Books and involvement in initiatives addressing gun violence are suggested as coping strategies. Ultimately, open and ongoing conversations with children prepare them to handle difficult events in the future.
