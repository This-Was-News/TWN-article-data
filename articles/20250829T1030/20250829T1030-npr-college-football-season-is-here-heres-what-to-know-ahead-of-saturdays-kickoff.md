## Article summary
The college football season kicks off with high stakes, featuring three top-10 matchups in the opening weekend for the first time. Arch Manning, the most-hyped player of a generation, takes the helm at Texas, facing expectations to win the Heisman Trophy and lead the Longhorns against defending champion Ohio State. The season includes a record number of high-profile games, driven by big TV deals and new financial incentives for schools to pay players. The College Football Playoff committee will prioritize strength of schedule, addressing last year's controversies. Notable transfers and coaching changes, including Bill Belichick's debut at North Carolina, add to the excitement. Meanwhile, TV disputes and mascot retirements, like Colorado's Ralphie VI, add unique subplots to the season.
