## Article summary
The article discusses the Trump administration's actions targeting independent U.S. institutions like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Federal Reserve. These agencies have historically been respected for their nonpartisan roles in providing crucial data for health and economic decisions. President Trump's efforts to remove or replace their leaders have raised concerns about the politicization of these institutions. Critics argue that this undermines their credibility and the trust Americans have in them for making informed decisions. The independence of these agencies is seen as vital for the nation's long-term health and economic stability. The article highlights the potential dangers of eroding the credibility of these institutions, which could lead to a loss of public trust in the information they provide.
