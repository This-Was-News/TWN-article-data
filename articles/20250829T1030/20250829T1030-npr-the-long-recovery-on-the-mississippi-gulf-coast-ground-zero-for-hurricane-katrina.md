## Article summary
The Mississippi Gulf Coast, particularly Waveland, was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with a 30-foot storm surge destroying nearly every home and killing 238 people in the state. Former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour recalls the utter devastation and the state's immediate need for federal assistance, which was initially overwhelmed but eventually improved. The recovery effort was bolstered by volunteers and federal grants, with a focus on rebuilding housing, jobs, and schools. However, the recovery has been uneven, with some areas like Waveland still struggling 20 years later, losing 20% of its population and facing strict building requirements. The storm also wiped out cultural treasures, such as the Gulfside Assembly, a significant retreat for African-Americans. Despite the challenges, the spirit of resilience and perseverance is evident among the survivors, who continue to rebuild and move forward.
