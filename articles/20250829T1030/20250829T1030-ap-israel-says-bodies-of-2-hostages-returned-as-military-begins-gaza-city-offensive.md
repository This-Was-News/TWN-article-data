## Article summary
Israel's military has recovered the bodies of two hostages, including an Israeli man killed in the October 7 attack that sparked the war. The bodies of Ilan Wess and another unnamed hostage were returned to Israel. Of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas-led militants, roughly 50 remain in Gaza, including 20 believed to be alive. Israel has suspended mid-day pauses in fighting in Gaza City, which had allowed humanitarian aid delivery, stating the city is now a dangerous combat zone. The suspension comes as Israel prepares to widen its offensive in the city, following strikes on key neighborhoods and the mobilization of tens of thousands of reservists. Gaza City, a Hamas stronghold with a network of tunnels, also houses critical infrastructure and health facilities. The United Nations warns that an invasion could halve Gaza's hospital bed capacity. The suspension follows a declaration of famine in Gaza City due to fighting, blockade, displacement, and collapsed food production. Aid groups report unprecedented access restrictions and challenges in delivering aid. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees warns that a large-scale ground offensive could displace an additional 1 million people, deepening suffering and pushing more toward catastrophe.
