## Article summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is experiencing significant turmoil. After six months of challenges, the agency has seen the loss of its new director, Susan Monarez, who was fired but refused to leave, and a wave of high-profile resignations. Three senior officials left in protest over Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine policies, prompting a clap-out from employees. The CDC has faced criticism from lawmakers and the public, exacerbated by a recent shooting at its headquarters that killed a police officer. Kennedy has publicly disparaged the agency, accusing its scientists of corruption and incompetence, and comparing vaccination to practices in Nazi death camps. He has indicated that changing the institutional culture will require removing certain individuals. Employees express deep sadness and concern for the agency's future.
