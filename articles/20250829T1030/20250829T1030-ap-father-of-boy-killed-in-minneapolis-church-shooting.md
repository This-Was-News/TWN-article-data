## Article summary
The families of two Catholic school students killed during Mass at a Minneapolis church are grappling with their loss. The father of 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel urged the community to remember his son for his love of family, fishing, and cooking, not the violence that ended his life. Fletcher and 10-year-old Harper Moysk were fatally shot, while more than a dozen schoolmates were wounded by 23-year-old Robin Westman, who fired 116 rifle rounds through the church's stained-glass windows. Surveillance video showed the shooter never entered the church. Harper's parents hope her memory will drive changes in gun violence and mental health issues. Fifteen children and three parishioners were injured, with one child in critical condition. Westman, who once attended the school, was armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol, and died by suicide. Investigators found hundreds of pieces of evidence, including hate-filled writings and videos expressing greivances and a fascination with mass killings. The FBI classified the attack as domestic terrorism motivated by hate. Westman's background included a name change and a mental health call in 2018, but no prior arrests that would have prevented him from legally purchasing firearms. The police chief praised the quick response of officers who rendered first aid and rescued children.
