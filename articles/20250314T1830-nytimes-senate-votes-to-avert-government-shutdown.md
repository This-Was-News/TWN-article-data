## Article summary
The Senate successfully passed a Republican stopgap spending bill on March 14, 2025, narrowly avoiding a government shutdown set for midnight. The final vote was 54 to 46, with significant Democratic support led by Senator Chuck Schumer, who joined Republicans to prevent a filibuster. This measure will fund the government until September 30 and includes a $6 billion increase for military spending while maintaining other federal funding levels set during the Biden administration. Schumer's decision to back the bill surprised many Democrats and sparked internal party tensions, as some members believed it would empower President Trump and his administration.

Critics of the bill argued it lacked specific congressional instructions for funding allocations, potentially allowing the Trump administration to manipulate federal resources. Schumer and several Democrats contended that a shutdown would give Trump greater control over government operations and exacerbate the situation for federal workers. The legislation also significantly cuts the budget for Washington, D.C., prompting concerns over essential services.

The bill has now moved to President Trump's desk for his signature. The vote highlighted divisions within the Democratic Party regarding the best strategy to oppose Trump's administration, with some members advocating for a stronger resistance against what they perceive as governmental overreach.
