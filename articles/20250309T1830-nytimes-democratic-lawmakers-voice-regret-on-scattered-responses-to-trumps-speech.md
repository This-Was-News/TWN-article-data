## Article summary
Democratic lawmakers expressed regret over their disorganized responses to President Trump's recent address to Congress, particularly criticizing Representative Al Green's disruptive protest during the speech. While the party leadership had encouraged a more restrained approach, Green's heckling drew criticism from both progressive and moderate Democrats, who felt it diverted attention from key economic issues. Representative Tom Suozzi and Senator Adam Schiff highlighted the need for a coordinated response focused on the implications of Trump's budget cuts, particularly concerning Medicaid. Senator Elissa Slotkin acknowledged Green's frustration but emphasized the importance of presenting a constructive agenda rather than merely opposing Trump.

Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer stressed the necessity of maintaining decorum and focusing on economic messaging. Even some of Green's progressive colleagues criticized his actions, equating them to the disruptive behavior of far-right representatives. In defense of his actions, Green argued for the necessity of "righteous indignation" against Trump's tactics, linking his protest to historical civil rights struggles. The incident has sparked a broader debate within the Democratic Party about the best strategies to counter Trump's agenda while maintaining party unity.
