## Article summary
The article discusses how federal employment has historically provided a pathway to the middle class for Black workers, but recent job cuts under the Trump administration threaten this stability. Figures like Shirley Hopkins and Calvin Stevens illustrate the significant roles that federal jobs played in building careers and supporting families within the Black community. The Trump administration's reductions in government jobs, hiring freezes, and dismantling of diversity programs are creating uncertainty and vulnerability for Black federal employees, who constitute about 18.5% of the federal workforce. 

Experts express concern that these cuts could disproportionately affect Black workers and hinder their opportunities for advancement, potentially leading to a decline in the Black middle class. The federal sector has traditionally offered structured career paths that are less common in private sectors, making these changes particularly alarming. The article highlights the broader implications for Black families and communities, especially in areas like Prince George's County, which have benefited from federal employment. With many Black workers now reconsidering their job prospects, the article raises questions about the future of job stability and economic mobility for this demographic. The ongoing shifts in federal employment could ultimately reshape the landscape for Black workers in America.
