## Article summary
The web page discusses the rollout of President Trump's crackdown on crime in Washington, D.C., highlighting the involvement of former Fox News personalities. Jeanne Prro, now the U.S. attorney for Washington, appeared with Trump to announce a federal takeover of the city's police force, emphasizing a crackdown on crime. Prro later appeared on Fox News, where she was introduced by Sean Hannity, echoing her calls for law and order. Right-wing media has supported Trump's crackdown, dismissing Democratic concerns about authoritarianism and crime rates. The page notes a feedback loop between Fox News and the Trump administration, with numerous Fox alumni holding positions in the administration. Pete Hegseth, another former Fox host and now defense secretary, also spoke at the news conference and later appeared on Fox News. Trump has focused on crime and disorder in D.C. for over two years, intensifying efforts after a recent attack on a prominent government official. Fox News host Will Cain displayed charts comparing D.C.'s crime rates to other cities, which Trump also used at his news conference. The page mentions Trump's lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch over a defamatory article in the Wall Street Journal. Hannity and Prro expressed mutual nostalgia for their Fox News days during the interview.
