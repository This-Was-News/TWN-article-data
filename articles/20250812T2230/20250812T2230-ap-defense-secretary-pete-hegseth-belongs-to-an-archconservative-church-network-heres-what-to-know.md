## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is a member of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), an archconservative network. CREC's theology includes complementarianism, which advocates for distinct gender roles, and Christian nationalism. Pastor Doug Wilson, a CREC co-founder, has sparked controversy with his views on women's voting rights and military service. Hegseth has publicly supported Wilson's teachings and attended CREC's new Washington church. CREC ascribes to a strict Reformed theology and is influenced by Christian Reconstructionism. Wilson advocates for a Christian America and embraces the label of Christian nationalist. The network has grown significantly since the 1970s and includes educational institutions and media outlets. Hegseth's affiliation with CREC has drawn scrutiny, particularly due to Wilson's controversial statements. Both Hegseth and Wilson have expressed admiration for each other's work. CREC's new Washington church aims to serve members working in government.
