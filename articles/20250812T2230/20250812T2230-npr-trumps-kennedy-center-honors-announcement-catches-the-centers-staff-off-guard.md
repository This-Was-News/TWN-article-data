## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced the recipients of the 48th annual Kennedy Center Honors, catching the staff off guard. The announcement, made on Truth Social, mentioned that the recipients would be revealed the following day. Staff members expressed concerns about having enough time to sell tickets and secure sponsorships. Trump's post included a humorous typo, alluding to a bill in Congress that proposed renaming the venue after him. He praised the work being done to restore the center to its former glory. The Kennedy Center Honors are prestigious awards recognizing artistic excellence, with past honorees including notable figures like Steven Spielberg and Quincy Jones. Trump has suggested honoring figures like Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley. The Honors have traditionally been a major fundraiser for the center. Trump recently overhauled the Kennedy Center's leadership, dismissing the Board of Trustees and long-time chair David Rubenstein. Under Trump's domestic spending agenda, the Kennedy Center is set to receive $257 million, six times its usual annual funding.
