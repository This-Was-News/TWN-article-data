## Article summary
President Trump has deployed the D.C. National Guard and taken temporary control of the city's police force, marking a significant escalation in his long-running threats to federalize the nation's capital. Despite claims of rising crime, overall violent crime in D.C. has dropped sharply. Home rule, granted in 1973, allows residents to elect their own mayor and city council but maintains Congress's control over legislation and budget. Before home rule, D.C. was governed by presidentially appointed commissioners for nearly a century. In the 1990s, a federally created board oversaw the city's finances due to financial troubles. Trump's current actions are unprecedented, as no president has previously federalized the MPD. Residents overwhelmingly support D.C. statehood, which was voted on in a 2016 referendum but lacks support in Congress. The push for home rule in the 1960s was intertwined with the Civil Rights Movement. Federal control has historically been more of a problem than a solution for D.C. Trump's takeover could potentially bring more attention to the issue of D.C. statehood.
