## Article summary
Israel is in discussions with South Sudan about the potential resettlement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to South Sudan. This is part of Israel's broader effort to facilitate mass emigration from Gaza, which has been devastated by a 22-month offensive against Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports this idea, referring to it as voluntary migration. However, Palestinians, rights groups, and much of the international community view these proposals as forced expulsion and a violation of international law. South Sudan, seeking closer ties with Israel and potential benefits from the U.S., is considering the deal. Egypt opposes the plan, fearing an influx of refugees. Previous talks with Sudan, Somaliland, and Somalia have also taken place, but their status is unknown. South Sudan is grappling with its own conflicts, hunger, and instability, making it an uncertain destination for Palestinian refugees. Palestinians fear permanent resettlement would prevent their eventual return to Gaza. The U.S. is aware of the discussions but is not directly involved. The situation remains complex, with significant human rights and geopolitical implications.
