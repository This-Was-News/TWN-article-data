## Article summary
Tropical Storm Erin, located west of Cape Verde, is expected to strengthen into the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season by late Thursday. The storm has already caused at least eight fatalities and property damage on the island of São Vicente. Forecasters predict Erin will move westward, crossing warm ocean waters and potentially impacting Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. East Coast, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles. Currently, the storm has maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour, with tropical storm-force winds extending 35 miles from its center. The National Hurricane Center warns of increased likelihood of the storm moving closer to several islands and coastal areas, but the exact effects remain uncertain. This year, NOAA predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season, with 13 to 19 named storms expected due to warmer ocean temperatures and weak wind shear. Climate change is contributing to more intense hurricanes, with higher sea surface temperatures leading to severe flooding, stronger winds, and heavier rainfall.
