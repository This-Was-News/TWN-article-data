## Article summary
Mexico is expelling 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States in a significant deal with the Trump administration. Among those expelled is Abigael González Valencia, brother-in-law of CJNG leader Nemesio Rubén El Mencho Oseguera Cervantes. The transfers come ahead of 25% tariffs on Mexican imports and follow a recent agreement to postpone threatened 30% tariffs. Mexican President Clauda Shenbaum has shown a willingness to cooperate on security but has drawn a line on Mexican sovereignty. The Trump administration has designated CJNG and seven other Latin American organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army is mobilizing up to 800 National Guard troops to support law enforcement in Washington, D.C., amid concerns over crime. The Trump administration has also released human rights reports that eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people and reduce focus on reproductive rights. Additionally, the administration is facing criticism for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts, with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. refusing to directly address concerns about misinformation and skepticism around vaccines. The summary also touches on various other news updates, including the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies, the stock market's performance, and political developments in Florida and Georgia.
