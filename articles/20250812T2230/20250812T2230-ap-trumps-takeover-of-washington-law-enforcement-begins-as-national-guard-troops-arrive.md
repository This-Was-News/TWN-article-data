## Article summary
President Donald Trump's takeover of Washington, D.C.'s law enforcement began as National Guard troops arrived. Trump activated the Guard and took over the city's police department, citing a crime emergency, despite local officials reporting declining crime rates. Mayor Muriel Bowser pledged to cooperate but maintained that the city's police chief remains in charge. The federal government's control over D.C. limits Bowser's ability to push back. Trump's plan includes deploying additional officers and agents, arresting individuals for various crimes, and removing homeless encampments. While crime rates have decreased, the administration focuses on visible law enforcement. Residents have mixed reactions, with some feeling safer and others concerned about the National Guard's presence. Bowser's relationship with Trump has evolved, with her now emphasizing common ground. Trump's actions reflect his aggressive approach to law enforcement, though he has not addressed root causes of crime and homelessness. The situation highlights the unique federal control over D.C. and the limitations of local autonomy.
