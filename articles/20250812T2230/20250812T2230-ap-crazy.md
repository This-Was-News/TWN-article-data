## Article summary
Staff at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) expressed shock and concern after President Donald Trump fired Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a disappointing jobs report in August 2020. Emails obtained by the Associated Press revealed that BLS employees emphasized the importance of accurate data and professional integrity in their work. The firing occurred after the report showed a significant drop in job additions and revisions indicating fewer jobs added in previous months than initially reported. Trump had criticized the report as 'phony' and accused the BLS of partisanship, claims that staff emails did not support. Acting Commissioner William Watrowski reassured staff that their mission to provide high-quality data remained unchanged. An assistant commissioner encouraged perseverance, comparing the situation to a ship's crew losing its captain but remaining steadfast. McEntarfer, in her email to staff, highlighted the critical role of BLS data in influencing markets and policy decisions. The White House stated that McEntarfer was removed due to the size of the revisions in the jobs report, suggesting flaws in the monthly report. Trump announced the nomination of E.J. Anton, a chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, to lead the BLS. Anton had previously suggested suspending monthly job reports due to inaccuracies and replacing them with quarterly updates. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany indicated that the administration hoped to continue releasing monthly jobs reports.
