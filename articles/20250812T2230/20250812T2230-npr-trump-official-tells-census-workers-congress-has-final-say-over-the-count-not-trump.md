## Article summary
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnck, overseeing the Census Bureau, acknowledged that Congress, not the President, has final authority over the national census. He suggested differentiating between legal and undocumented residents during the count. This comes amid Republican efforts to use census data for redistricting before the 2026 midterm elections. Trump's call for a new census before 2030 has been deemed impractical by experts. Lutnck's remarks hint at potential legal challenges to Trump's proposal. The 14th Amendment requires counting all persons in each state for apportionment. Lutnck previously promised to count every person but also supported consistency in excluding non-citizens. The Commerce Department's statement focused on modernizing census technology. Republican proposals aim to exclude undocumented individuals and even legal residents without citizenship from the count. Florida officials have proposed recounts and corrections to census data for redistricting and federal funding.
