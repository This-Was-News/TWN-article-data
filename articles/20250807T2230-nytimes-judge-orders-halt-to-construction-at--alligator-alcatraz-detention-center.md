## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered a 14-day halt to construction at Florida's 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention center while she considers arguments that building and operating the immigration detention facility could harm the environment. Judge Kathleen M. Williams of the Federal District Court in Miami issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting further installation of lighting, paving, fencing, or other fixtures. The order is temporary, allowing the judge time to complete a hearing in the case, which was filed in June by several environmental groups. These groups argue that the project proceeded without completing the required federal environmental review and are seeking a preliminary injunction to stop operations and construction. The detention center, run by the state but housing federal immigration detainees, will remain operational, according to a statement by Gov. Ron DeSantis's communications director, Alex Lanfrancon. Judge Williams heard testimony for a day and a half before ruling. An environmental activist and witness, Jessica Namath, testified that she saw ongoing construction activity on the site as recently as the previous Friday. The ruling does not impact immigration enforcement in Florida, and detainees will remain at the center. The judge is expected to issue a written order soon.
