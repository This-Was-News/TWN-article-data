## Article summary
Kash Patel's confirmation as F.B.I. director marks a significant shift in the agency, as he seeks to reshape it to align with the White House's agenda. His approach includes the removal and demotion of numerous agents, alongside mandatory polygraph tests aimed at identifying news leak sources. This has created an atmosphere of fear among employees, many of whom worry about potential retaliation for past investigations tied to President Trump. Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino, plan to revisit controversial cases, which critics argue may politicize the bureau further. The disbandment of key investigative units, particularly those focused on Trump-related inquiries, raises concerns about the agency's integrity and independence. 

Former officials warn that the ongoing personnel changes could lead to a loss of expertise and discourage agents from pursuing sensitive cases. The F.B.I.'s leadership structure appears chaotic, with many agents being forced out or reassigned without clear justification. Additionally, the increasing use of polygraphs has fostered a culture of intimidation, as employees are pressured to remain silent on internal matters. Despite these upheavals, Patel claims that retirements and personnel changes are routine and do not impact the agency's operations. Overall, the F.B.I. is undergoing a profound transformation that critics fear could undermine its foundational principles.
