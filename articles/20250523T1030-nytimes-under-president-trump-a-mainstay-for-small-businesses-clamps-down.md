## Article summary
Under the Trump administration, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has significantly reduced staff and rolled back programs aimed at supporting minority and women-owned businesses. Administrator Kelly Loeffler has implemented aggressive cuts, including a 43% reduction in workforce, which has led to slower response times and hindered the agency's ability to manage disaster loans effectively. These changes particularly impact Black, Hispanic, and immigrant entrepreneurs, as the SBA has eliminated initiatives designed to promote diversity and inclusion. Critics, including Senator Edward J. Markey, have condemned the administration's approach, arguing it undermines the agency's core mission of supporting small businesses.

The SBA has also tightened lending requirements, reversing prior measures that facilitated access to credit for smaller enterprises, which has led to increased defaults. Additionally, new citizenship requirements for loan eligibility have caused complications for some businesses, resulting in lost funding opportunities. As the agency withdraws support for programs dedicated to women and minorities, federal procurement goals for disadvantaged businesses have been significantly lowered. Overall, these changes are expected to restrict small businesses' access to essential resources and funding, exacerbating challenges in an already difficult economic landscape.
