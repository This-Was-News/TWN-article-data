## Article summary
The article discusses a dating boot camp inspired by the reality show "Love on the Spectrum," designed to help individuals with autism navigate the dating world. Participants, like Bradley Goldman, receive coaching on social skills and strategies to improve their dating experiences. Goldman reflects on his recent date, noting challenges with venue choice and disclosure of his autism diagnosis. The program, developed by Dr. Elizabeth Laugeson, aims to address the historical lack of focus on romance for people with autism, which has changed significantly over the years. The PEERS course teaches skills such as interpreting body language and managing conversation silences, helping participants build confidence. While some advocates criticize social skills training for promoting masking, the program emphasizes authenticity and individual choice. Participants report positive experiences and increased readiness to engage in dating. The article highlights the changing attitudes towards autism and the growing recognition of the desire for romance among autistic individuals. Ultimately, the boot camp fosters a supportive environment where participants can learn and grow in their pursuit of love.
