## Article summary
The White House has declared the review of a Signal group chat incident involving high-ranking officials as "case closed." The mishap occurred when Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently included in discussions about military strikes in Yemen. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the review, which involved the National Security Council and other key figures, has concluded, stating that no classified information was disclosed. Steps are being taken to prevent such incidents in the future, although specific details were not provided. National security adviser Mike Waltz, who created the group chat, remains a vital part of the national security team. Additionally, bipartisan Senate leaders have requested an investigation by the Pentagon's acting inspector general. A nonprofit watchdog has also filed a lawsuit to ensure the records of the chat are preserved according to the Federal Records Act. The incident has raised concerns about the security of sensitive information shared via the app.
