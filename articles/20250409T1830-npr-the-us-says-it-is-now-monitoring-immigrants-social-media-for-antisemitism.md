## Article summary
The U.S. government has announced that it will begin monitoring the social media activity of immigrants for signs of antisemitism as part of its immigration policy. This initiative, effective immediately, targets individuals applying for permanent residence and those associated with educational institutions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) emphasizes the need to protect the U.S. from extremists and terrorist sympathizers, specifically mentioning groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. The announcement follows recent arrests of pro-Palestinian student activists, which the government links to antisemitic activities, although their lawyers dispute these claims.

Critics, including civil rights organizations and pro-Israel groups, argue that this policy may infringe on free speech rights and mischaracterizes legitimate political expression as antisemitism. J-Street, a pro-Israel organization, has condemned the policy, stating that it undermines American values of free speech. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has asserted that advocating for violence should result in visa revocation, reinforcing the administration's strict stance on immigration and speech related to terrorism. The policy reflects a broader trend of heightened scrutiny in educational environments regarding speech and activism.
