## Article summary
Leaked messages from a Signal group chat among Trump administration officials reveal a disdainful attitude towards Europe, with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth labeling European nations as "pathetic" and accusing them of freeloading on U.S. military efforts. The discussion, which included operational details about a planned strike on Yemen, highlighted a belief that European nations should compensate the U.S. for military actions that benefit them. European officials expressed anger and exasperation at the contempt shown in these messages, which they feel undermines the longstanding transatlantic alliance.

The leaked exchange reflects broader tensions between the U.S. and Europe, particularly regarding military spending and shared values. Vance's recent speech questioning European democracy and values further exacerbated these tensions. While European leaders seek to bolster their defense budgets and maintain the alliance, they are increasingly aware of the U.S.'s shifting stance towards Europe, which includes demands for financial contributions and a more transactional relationship.

The incident raises concerns about security protocols, as discussing sensitive military plans on a messaging app could jeopardize intelligence sharing and trust between allies. Overall, the situation indicates a potential fracture in U.S.-European relations, with European officials contemplating a future where the alliance may not hold the same significance as it once did.
