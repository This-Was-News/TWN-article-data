## Article summary
Travis Decker, a Washington state father, is on the run after being accused of kidnapping and murdering his three young daughters—Olivia, 5; Evelyn, 8; and Paityn, 9. The search for Decker began on May 30 when his ex-wife reported the girls missing after they did not return from a visitation. Authorities discovered Decker's abandoned vehicle and the girls' bodies nearby on June 1. The investigation has involved state, local, and federal law enforcement, with a reward of up to $20,000 offered for information leading to his arrest.

Decker, a former Army infantryman, has a history of mental health issues and is considered dangerous and capable of surviving in the wilderness. The girls were found with signs of suffocation and zip ties, leading authorities to classify their deaths as homicides. The manhunt has intensified, with law enforcement urging residents in remote areas to secure their homes and report any suspicious activity. As of the latest updates, Decker is believed to be in the vicinity of Ingalls Creek and Valley High. The community is deeply affected by the tragic loss of the children.
