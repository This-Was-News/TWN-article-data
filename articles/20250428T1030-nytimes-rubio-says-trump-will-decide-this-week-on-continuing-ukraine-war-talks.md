## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will decide this week whether to continue negotiations regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He emphasized the importance of determining the U.S. involvement in these talks, stating that while there are reasons for optimism, realistic challenges remain. Rubio did not provide specific details about the current state of discussions, leaving it unclear if the timeline was intended to pressure Ukraine and Russia or if the administration might withdraw from negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicated that a settlement was not imminent and that specific elements of a potential deal still needed refinement. 

Recent meetings between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have reignited discussions, although tensions have existed due to Trump's past comments favoring Putin. Key contentious issues include U.S. recognition of Crimea as Russian territory and Ukraine's NATO membership status. Following a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, both leaders expressed hope for a productive outcome. The Trump administration's insistence on European nations providing security guarantees for Ukraine remains a sticking point. Rubio highlighted that a decision on the feasibility of a compromise would be made soon.
