## Article summary
The White House is expected to pause approximately $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania due to its policies regarding transgender athletes. This decision represents a significant escalation in the government's ongoing campaign against the inclusion of transgender individuals in public life, particularly in sports. The administration's action follows previous funding cuts to Columbia University over accusations of insufficiently addressing antisemitism. The White House's rationale centers on the university's support for Lia Thomas, a transgender woman who competed on the women's swim team, which has drawn criticism from some former team members. 

Despite the reports of funding suspension, the University of Pennsylvania stated it had not received official notice and maintains compliance with relevant regulations. The funding pause comes amidst broader federal inquiries into numerous educational institutions as the administration seeks to tighten federal spending. Additionally, the administration has threatened to cut funding to K-12 schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports. 

The financial implications for Penn could be severe, particularly in medical sciences, which are critical to the university's operations. As federal funding becomes increasingly uncertain, universities are bracing for potential budget cuts, with some already implementing hiring freezes and reviewing capital spending. The situation reflects a growing trend of federal scrutiny over diversity and inclusion policies at elite institutions.
