## Article summary
The potential deal between Ukraine and the U.S., as announced by President Trump, focuses on sharing Ukraine's mineral wealth in exchange for military aid amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy views this as a preliminary step to ensure U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine. The draft agreement proposes that Ukraine contribute half of its mineral revenue to a Reconstruction Investment Fund managed jointly with the U.S. Ukraine holds significant reserves of various minerals, estimated to account for about 5% of global rare-earth metal reserves. However, much of this mineral wealth is located in regions currently under Russian control, complicating extraction efforts.

Five key minerals under consideration include titanium, lithium, graphite, nickel, and cobalt. Ukraine ranks among the top ten for titanium reserves, crucial for aerospace applications. It also possesses one of Europe’s largest lithium reserves, though mining has not yet commenced due to investment barriers. Graphite, while minimally produced, is essential in steel production, and nickel and cobalt are vital for battery production, particularly in electric vehicles. Despite the potential, ongoing conflict and damaged infrastructure pose significant challenges to securing long-term investments in these resources, which could play a crucial role in the global market.
