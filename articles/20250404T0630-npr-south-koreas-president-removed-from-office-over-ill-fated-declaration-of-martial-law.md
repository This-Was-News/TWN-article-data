## Article summary
South Korea's Constitutional Court has removed President Yoon Suk Yeol from office following a unanimous ruling that upheld his impeachment by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. This decision stems from Yoon's declaration of martial law, which lasted just six hours and involved military occupation of parliament, actions deemed illegal and a violation of democratic principles. Yoon is the second South Korean president to be impeached, following Park Geun-hye in 2017. His presidency, marked by significant political turmoil and public protests, concluded with calls for unity and recovery from the crisis.

In the aftermath of the ruling, a snap election is expected within 60 days, with opposition leader Lee Jae-myung positioned as a likely successor. The court's verdict emphasized that Yoon's military response to political gridlock was inappropriate, urging resolution through political means instead. Public reaction to the court's decision was overwhelmingly positive among those opposed to Yoon, while his supporters expressed dismay. Yoon's removal highlights the ongoing political and social divisions in South Korea, which may persist as the nation navigates the transition to new leadership. Following the ruling, Yoon issued a statement thanking supporters and acknowledging his failure to meet expectations.
