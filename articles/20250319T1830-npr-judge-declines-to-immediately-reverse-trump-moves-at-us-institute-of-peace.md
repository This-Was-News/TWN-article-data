## Article summary
A federal judge has denied a request to block the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), a congressionally funded think tank created to promote American soft power and conflict resolution. The judge expressed concern over the handling of the situation, noting it was "offensive" and possibly terrorizing employees. The Trump administration's actions, including the firing of 11 of the 15 board members, have sparked legal challenges from former board members who seek reinstatement and argue that USIP is an independent entity not subject to executive branch control. The judge raised questions about the nature of USIP, whether it operates as an independent agency or falls under the executive branch. USIP has been critical of the administration's approach, claiming it has no authority to dismantle the think tank as it is directly funded by Congress. The Heritage Foundation has criticized USIP for perceived political bias, which has influenced the administration's decision to target the organization. Amid this turmoil, USIP staff are preparing to challenge the legitimacy of the new leadership appointments made by the Trump administration. The situation reflects broader tensions between the executive branch and independent agencies, particularly regarding funding and governance.
