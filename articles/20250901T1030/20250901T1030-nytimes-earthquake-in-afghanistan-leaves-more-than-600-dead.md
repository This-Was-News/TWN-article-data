## Article summary
A 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan near the border with Pakistan, resulting in over 600 deaths and injuring more than 1,300 people. Authorities expect the death toll to rise as rescue workers reach remote, mountainous areas. The epicenter was near Jalalabad, and aftershocks were felt in Kabul. The shallow depth of the quake increased its destructiveness. Residents rushed to help neighbors trapped under collapsed houses. Rescue efforts were hampered by difficult road access and landslides. At least four eastern provinces were affected. Earthquakes are common in the region due to its geological faults. In 2022, a 5.9-magnitude quake killed at least 1,300 people. The Taliban, ruling since 2021, reported over 4,000 deaths from that event.
