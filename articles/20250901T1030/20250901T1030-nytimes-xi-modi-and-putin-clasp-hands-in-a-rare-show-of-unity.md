## Article summary
The leaders of China, Russia, and India—Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Narendra Modi—displayed unity at a summit in eastern China, signaling a close bond and an alternative world order challenging the United States. Their interactions, including hand-holding and shared rides, conveyed messages of solidarity and strategic partnerships. Analysts noted that this display was intended to counter Western influence, particularly amid U.S. trade policies that have alienated countries like India. The summit, part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, highlighted China's efforts to position itself as a stable global leader and rally partners against U.S. policies. Xi Jinping criticized Cold War mentalities and bullying, while Modi advocated for multilateralism and an inclusive world order. Despite public displays of unity, deep-seated mistrust and conflicting interests persist among the three nations, including border disputes between China and India, and economic and geopolitical tensions. The summit also served as a platform for China to assert its historical and strategic claims, particularly in relation to World War II and its role in the post-war global order.
