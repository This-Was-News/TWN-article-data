## Article summary
A web page reports that over 1.2 million immigrants have left the U.S. labor force from January to July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. This decline impacts various sectors, including farming, construction, and healthcare, where immigrants make up significant portions of the workforce. The decrease in the immigrant population follows President Donald Trump's intensified immigration policies, which have led to increased deportations and deterred border crossings. Experts note that immigrants contribute substantially to job growth and that their absence is affecting labor availability and economic stability. Farmworkers, construction workers, and healthcare aides are among those most affected. The fear of deportation has caused many immigrants to avoid work or leave the country, disrupting industries and communities. The loss of immigrant workers is also leading to wasted crops and stalled construction projects. The web page highlights personal stories of immigrants facing deportation and the broader economic implications of these policies.
