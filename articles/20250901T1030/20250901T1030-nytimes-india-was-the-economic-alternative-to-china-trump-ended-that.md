## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of President Trump's 50% tariffs on India, which have disrupted the economic alliance between India and the U.S. against China. These tariffs have undermined significant investments made by American companies to reduce their dependence on China, leaving India's strategy in tatters. Indian officials and business leaders are struggling to adapt to this sudden change, as evidenced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to China. The 'China Plus One' strategy, which positioned India as an alternative to Chinese manufacturing, is now in jeopardy. The tariffs are causing disruptions in supply chains and making India less attractive to American importers, who may now consider other countries like Vietnam or Mexico. A recent U.S. court ruling did not resolve the issues between the two nations. The article highlights the challenges India faces in pursuing its manufacturing ambitions without U.S. support and potentially closer coordination with China.
