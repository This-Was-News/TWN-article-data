## Article summary
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in northern China brought together leaders from Russia, China, India, and seven other nations, potentially challenging U.S. global leadership. The SCO, now with 10 full members including Iran and Belarus, has grown in size and influence since its founding 24 years ago, though its goals and impact remain unclear. China dominates the organization, with Russia using it to maintain influence over Central Asian nations. The SCO serves as a platform for regional military cooperation, though limited to joint drills and friendly competitions. India's membership challenges Chinese and Russian dominance, despite trade tensions with the U.S. India has refused to support Russia's war in Ukraine or China's claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea. The summit aimed to strengthen economic cooperation and chart the bloc's future development, with China emphasizing its economic benefits. Leaders from about a dozen other countries joined as dialogue partners or guests, including Egypt and several Southeast Asian nations. The summit also marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, with many leaders expected to attend a military parade in Beijing featuring North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
