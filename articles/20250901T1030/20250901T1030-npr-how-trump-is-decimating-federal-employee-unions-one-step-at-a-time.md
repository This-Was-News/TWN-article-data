## Article summary
The Department of Veterans Affairs ended nearly all collective bargaining agreements, forcing unions to vacate federal buildings. Federal employees have had collective bargaining rights since the 1960s, though they cannot negotiate wages or strike. President Trump has targeted federal employee unions, issuing executive orders to end collective bargaining rights for over a million workers across 20 agencies. The Trump administration argues that unions pose a danger to national security and obstruct management. Unions have filed lawsuits, alleging retaliation, but appeals courts have allowed the administration to proceed. The VA claims ending collective bargaining will allow employees to focus on serving veterans, but union representatives dispute this. Trump's executive orders apply to a broad range of agencies, excluding those supporting his agenda. Federal employees are quitting, fearing loss of workplace rights and flexibility. The administration's actions are leading to a loss of expertise in critical areas like drug safety and food inspection.
