## Article summary
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with a broken vertebra, multiple lacerations, and other injuries after a high-speed car accident in New Hampshire. The incident occurred when his car was struck from behind while he was traveling on a highway. Giuliani's spokesperson, Michael Ragusa, confirmed that he is in good spirits and recovering well, emphasizing that the accident was not a targeted attack. Giuliani had previously assisted a woman involved in a domestic violence incident before the crash. The New Hampshire State Police are investigating the accident, which involved two heavily damaged vehicles. Three people, including Giuliani, suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Giuliani's son thanked those who reached out and described his father as tough. Giuliani, known for his prominent role in Republican politics and his legal challenges to the 2020 election results, has faced significant legal troubles, including indictments and a defamation case.
