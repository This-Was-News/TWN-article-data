## Article summary
Many beaches along the U.S. coastline are under advisories due to unsafe levels of fecal contamination, discouraging swimming this Labor Day weekend. Popular beaches in Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, California, and Hawaii have issued warnings or closures. A report by Environment America found that nearly two-thirds of tested beaches in 2024 had at least one day with potentially unsafe contamination levels. Outdated water and sewer systems, severe weather, and suburban sprawl contribute to the problem. Despite warnings, some beachgoers remain unconcerned. Environment America's report assessed beach safety based on EPA standards, which can cause illness in swimmers. In North Carolina, five beaches were under advisories due to elevated fecal bacteria levels, exacerbated by recent storms and Hurricane Ernesto.
