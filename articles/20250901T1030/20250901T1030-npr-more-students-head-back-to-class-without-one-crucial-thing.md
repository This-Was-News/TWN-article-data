## Article summary
As students return to school, many states are implementing bans on cell phones during school hours. Texas is enforcing a statewide ban, with reports of increased student engagement and reduced anxiety. Nationwide, 31 states and the District of Columbia now restrict cell phone use in schools, supported by both Republican and Democratic leaders. However, enforcement can be uneven, with some teachers resisting the ban. Schools like Lincoln High School in Portland are adapting to stricter policies, locking away phones for the entire day, which has raised concerns from parents. The cost of implementing these bans is significant, with schools distributing locked pouches for phones. While teachers overwhelmingly support the bans, students are less enthusiastic, citing concerns about homework and missing out on capturing memories. Despite initial resistance, many hope that students will eventually see the benefits of a phone-free learning environment.
