A devastating earthquake with a magnitude of 6.0 struck eastern Afghanistan late Sunday, causing extensive damage and killing at least 800 people while injuring more than 2,500, according to the Taliban government. The quake, centered near Jalalabad, hit the provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar, leading to the collapse of numerous buildings. Rescue efforts were hampered by the remote, mountainous terrain and poor communication. Survivors described scenes of chaos, with homes collapsing and people trapped under rubble. Rescue operations and medical teams from various regions were deployed to assist. The Taliban government pledged to utilize all available resources to save lives. The earthquake was felt in parts of neighboring Pakistan, but no casualties or damage were reported there. The Pakistani Prime Minister expressed condolences and offered support to Afghanistan. This earthquake follows a previous deadly quake in October 2023, which killed thousands.
