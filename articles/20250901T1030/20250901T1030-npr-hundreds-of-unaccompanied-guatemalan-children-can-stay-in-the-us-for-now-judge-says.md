## Article summary
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of Guatemalan children who crossed the U.S. border alone. The judge's order, issued on Sunday, allows lawyers 14 more days to discuss the case and prevents any children from being removed during this period. The children, under the care of the Department of Health and Human Services, were intended to be deported without proper legal proceedings. Lawyers for the children argued that the U.S. government did not notify the children ahead of time, depriving them of their legal right to pursue asylum. The attorneys also expressed concern that sending the children to Guatemala could put them at risk of abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture. The National Immigration Law Center, involved in the case, criticized the administration's actions as rushed and lacking procedural protections. The Guatemalan government reportedly requested the return of the children, but the U.S. government did not immediately comment. The judge's intervention was seen as a relief by the children's advocates, who plan to continue fighting to protect the Guatemalan children.
