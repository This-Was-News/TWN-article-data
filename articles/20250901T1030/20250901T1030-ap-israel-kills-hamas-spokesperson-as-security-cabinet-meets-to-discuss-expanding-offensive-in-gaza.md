## Article summary
Israel's military announced the killing of Hamas' longtime spokesperson, Abu Obeda, as the country's security cabinet met to discuss expanding its offensive in Gaza's most populated areas. The cabinet did not plan to discuss ceasefire negotiations. Hamas has not commented on the claim. Abu Obeda's last statement warned that hostages in fighting areas might die, and their remains could disappear. Israel's military accused the spokesperson of releasing hostage videos and threatened remaining Hamas leaders abroad. Meanwhile, at least 43 Palestinians were killed in Gaza City, many while seeking aid. Witnesses reported Israeli troops opening fire on crowds in the Netzarm Corridor. Civilians have been killed as UN humanitarian convoys are overwhelmed by looters. Israel has urged Palestinians to flee Gaza City, but many are exhausted from repeated displacements. Seven more Palestinians died of malnutrition-related causes, bringing the adult toll to 215 since June. A flotilla of ships departed Barcelona for Gaza with humanitarian aid and activists. At least 63,371 Palestinians have died during the war, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.
