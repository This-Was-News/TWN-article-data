## Article summary
A devastating earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan late Sunday, killing at least 800 people and injuring over 2,500, according to the Taliban government. The 6.0 magnitude quake hit towns in Kunar province, near Jalalabad and neighboring Nangarhar province, causing extensive damage. The quake was shallow, increasing its destructive impact, and several aftershocks followed. Rescuers worked through the night, pulling injured people from collapsed buildings, while desperate villagers searched for missing loved ones. The earthquake destroyed numerous villages, with one resident describing entire communities being leveled. Rescue operations are underway, with medical teams arriving from various regions. The Taliban government has pledged to utilize all available resources to save lives. The quake was felt in parts of neighboring Pakistan, but no casualties or damage were reported there. This earthquake follows a previous devastating quake in Afghanistan in October 2023, which killed thousands.
