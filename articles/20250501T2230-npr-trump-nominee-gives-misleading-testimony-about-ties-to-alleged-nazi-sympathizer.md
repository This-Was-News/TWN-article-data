## Article summary
Ed Martin, President Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney for D.C., is facing scrutiny over his connections to Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, a convicted Jan. 6 rioter labeled a "Nazi sympathizer." Despite Martin's claims of ignorance regarding Hale-Cusanelli's antisemitic views, NPR's investigation reveals a history of Martin praising him as a "great friend" and "amazing guy" in various podcast interviews. In written testimony to the Senate, Martin stated he was unaware of Hale-Cusanelli's comments until August 2024, contradicting earlier statements where he discussed Hale-Cusanelli's trial details and awarded him at a Trump property. Following NPR's inquiries about Hale-Cusanelli's past, Martin dismissed the outlet as "government-funded propaganda" without addressing the antisemitic rhetoric. Martin's evolving statements, including a public apology, have raised concerns among Senate Democrats, who plan to block his confirmation. Jewish civil rights organizations have condemned Martin's decision to honor Hale-Cusanelli. The timeline of Martin's interactions with Hale-Cusanelli suggests a closer relationship than he admits. Critics, including Sen. Dick Durbin, have accused Martin of making false statements during his testimony. Overall, Martin's connections and responses have sparked significant controversy regarding his suitability for the position.
