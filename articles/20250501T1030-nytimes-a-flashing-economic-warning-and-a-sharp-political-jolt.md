## Article summary
The article discusses the political and economic implications of President Trump's tariffs and the contraction of the U.S. GDP during his early days in office. The GDP decline has raised questions about Trump's economic management, a key aspect of his identity as a leader. Amidst skepticism from the public regarding his handling of the economy and trade, Trump's aggressive tariff policies have begun to create uncertainty among businesses and consumers. His advisers are starting to recognize potential missteps in the timing and execution of these tariffs, leading to new exceptions aimed at easing the burden on American manufacturers. The article highlights the disconnect between Trump's promises of a manufacturing renaissance and the immediate economic pain from rising prices and potential shortages. As businesses struggle to navigate an opaque economic environment, Trump's negotiations with international partners could play a crucial role in shaping the future. The piece also contrasts Trump's expectations for a swift resolution with the reality of slow-moving investments and the strategic calculations of global leaders like China's Xi Jinping. Ultimately, it underscores the high stakes for Trump as he faces disapproval ratings and the risk of economic downturn impacting his political future.
