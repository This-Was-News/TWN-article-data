## Article summary
Mexico has transferred nearly 30 high-profile cartel operatives to the United States, including notorious drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been sought for justice for 40 years. This significant handover marks one of Mexico's most important efforts in the ongoing drug war, facilitating the prosecution of traffickers in U.S. courts. Caro Quintero, a founding member of the Sinaloa cartel, is infamous for orchestrating the 1985 murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena. The transfer aligns with the Trump administration's pressure on Mexico to intensify its fight against drug cartels, amid ongoing discussions about a security agreement between the two nations.

The release of these operatives is viewed as a diplomatic victory for Trump and a sign of cooperation from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In addition to Caro Quintero, Miguel Ángel Treviño Morales, a former leader of the Zetas cartel, was also handed over to U.S. authorities. Treviño is known for his violent tactics and faces multiple drug charges in Texas. The U.S. government has yet to comment publicly on the transfer, but it has been celebrated by American law enforcement as a pivotal moment in combating cartel influence. Caro Quintero is expected to appear in federal court soon to face charges related to drug trafficking.
