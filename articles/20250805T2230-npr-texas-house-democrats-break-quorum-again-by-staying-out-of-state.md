## Article summary
Texas House Democrats have broken quorum by fleeing the state to prevent a vote on a congressional redistricting bill that heavily favors Republicans. The bill, which adds five new GOP-leaning districts, was passed by a committee, prompting Democrats to leave for Illinois and New York. Governor Greg Abbott has criticized the Democrats' actions and ordered state troopers to arrest and return them, though troopers lack jurisdiction outside Texas. Republicans control the House but cannot conduct business without the required quorum. Democrats argue that the redistricting is unfair and have vowed to stay out of state until the special session ends on August 19, with some lawmakers receiving support from other states.
