## Article summary
President Trump is preparing to issue an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take necessary steps for its closure. The draft of the order acknowledges that the department's creation by Congress limits its alteration without legislative approval. The move follows Trump's long-standing criticism of federal control over education, citing a lack of improvement in student performance despite significant federal spending since the department's establishment in 1979. 

McMahon, confirmed as Secretary, has expressed her commitment to executing the order and plans to present Congress with a strategy for unwinding the department's responsibilities. The order asserts that federal education programs have failed American students and suggests reallocating certain funding streams, although McMahon assures that key programs like Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) would remain intact. 

Despite the administration's intentions, historical attempts to close the department have faced obstacles, and public opinion appears to oppose the move, with a recent poll indicating that 63% of Americans favor keeping the department. The proposed dismantling raises concerns about the impact on vulnerable student populations and the enforcement of civil rights in education.
