## Article summary
Republicans in Congress have shifted their stance on supporting Ukraine, aligning with President Trump's recent reversal. Once vocal opponents of aiding Ukraine, many Republicans now endorse Trump's plan to expedite weapons to the country. This shift highlights Trump's influence over the party, with some members contorting their positions to align with him. Some Republicans argue that voters who elected Trump and Republicans expect a focus on domestic issues rather than foreign aid. Despite the party's shift, some members, like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, maintain their opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign wars, feeling perplexed by the criticism they face for adhering to their original views.
