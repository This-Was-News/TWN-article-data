## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) under Trump has recently charged several noncitizens with illegal voting, including a Ukrainian mother and daughter, an Iraqi man, and a Jamaican woman. These charges are part of a broader narrative pushed by Trump and his allies, claiming that non-U.S. citizens are voting in significant numbers. However, evidence suggests these cases often stem from misunderstandings of voting eligibility rather than widespread fraud. The DOJ's actions coincide with Trump's executive order aimed at increasing document checks for voter registration, despite a lack of substantial evidence supporting claims of systemic voter fraud.

The involvement of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in these investigations remains unclear, with some reports suggesting it assisted in identifying potential noncitizen voters. Recent audits in states like Michigan and Georgia found only a handful of potential noncitizen votes among millions cast, indicating that such occurrences are rare. Critics argue that the political rhetoric surrounding noncitizen voting could lead to restrictive voting laws that may disenfranchise eligible voters. The Michigan Secretary of State has emphasized the need for careful measures rather than broad restrictions, advocating for targeted solutions to ensure only eligible citizens vote.
