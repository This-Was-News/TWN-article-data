## Article summary
Ukraine launched a significant drone attack on Moscow, described as the largest since the onset of the war, resulting in at least two fatalities and 18 injuries. The strike disrupted operations at the city's four international airports, highlighting Ukraine's ability to retaliate despite ongoing losses. Russian officials claimed to have intercepted numerous drones, while President Putin was briefed on the situation. This attack coincided with high-level discussions scheduled in Saudi Arabia aimed at negotiating a potential ceasefire. Ukraine proposed an immediate air truce, contingent on Russia halting its long-range strikes, a plan supported by European nations. In contrast, Russia has intensified its bombardment of Ukraine, including drone strikes on civilian targets. Recent developments indicate that while Russian forces have made territorial gains, the overall offensive may be stalling. Ukrainian military leadership has emphasized the need for reinforcements to maintain their positions. The situation remains precarious as both sides prepare for potential negotiations amidst escalating violence.
