## Article summary
The article discusses a confrontation between President Trump and Maine Governor Janet Mills regarding an executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports. During a meeting with governors, Trump questioned Mills about her state's compliance with the order. Mills asserted that she would adhere to state and federal laws, prompting Trump to threaten withholding federal funding if she did not comply. He emphasized that public opinion favored his stance, suggesting that a poll indicated only 18% of Americans supported transgender female athletes competing in women's sports.

Mills responded defiantly, indicating her willingness to face legal action if necessary. This exchange highlighted a rare moment of resistance against Trump, who has been described as increasingly authoritative during his second term. Following their confrontation, the U.S. Department of Education initiated an investigation into Maine's education policies concerning transgender athletes. The article notes that other governors present at the meeting expressed concern over the harshness of the exchange, yet acknowledged Mills' firm stance against Trump. Overall, the incident underscores the ongoing national debate over transgender rights in sports.
