## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's shift from tax cuts to tariffs amid economic concerns, highlighting warnings that his policies could exacerbate national debt, harm low-income families, and yield less growth than promised. Following a tax cut approval that unsettled financial markets, Trump threatened significant tariffs on the European Union and Apple, raising fears of increased consumer prices. Despite a shaky market response and concerns from economists about the potential for a downturn, Trump remains optimistic that his economic agenda will spur growth and create jobs. However, analysts predict that his tax cuts could add trillions to the national debt without substantial economic benefits. The Federal Reserve faces challenges in managing rising borrowing costs and inflation, as businesses prepare for potential price increases due to tariffs. Trump's administration continues to assert that better tax policy will lead to improved economic growth, despite mounting evidence to the contrary. As uncertainty looms, businesses are hesitant to make decisions, waiting for clarity on the administration's policies. Overall, the article portrays a stark contrast between Trump's optimistic outlook and the cautious reality perceived by investors and economists.
