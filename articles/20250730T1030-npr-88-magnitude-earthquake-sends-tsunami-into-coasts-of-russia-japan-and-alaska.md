An 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, triggering tsunamis that affected Japan, Hawaii, and Alaska. Tsunami waves flooded ports in Kamchatka, Russia, and reached up to 4 meters in height, with smaller waves hitting Japan and Alaska. Authorities issued warnings and evacuations, with people fleeing to higher ground and traffic jams forming in Hawaii. The tsunami's impact was expected to last for hours or more, with multiple waves posing risks to coastal areas. The earthquake was one of the strongest recorded, with aftershocks and disruptions to transportation and power supplies reported.
