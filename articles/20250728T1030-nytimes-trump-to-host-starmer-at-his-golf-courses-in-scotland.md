## Article summary
President Trump will host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his Scottish golf courses to discuss trade, the Gaza humanitarian crisis, and the Ukraine war. A new U.S.-E.U. trade deal sets a 15% tariff on most E.U. goods, including cars, and includes a $750 billion energy purchase and $600 billion investment in the U.S. The agreement aims to avoid a costly trade war and address economic imbalances, though details remain unclear. Starmer faces pressure to address Gaza's humanitarian crisis and may push Trump to increase aid to the region. The deal reflects Europe's strategy to survive Trump's trade policies while advancing foreign policy priorities, but its long-term impact remains uncertain.
