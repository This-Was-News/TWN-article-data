## Article summary
The funeral of Pope Francis took place in Rome, drawing tens of thousands of mourners and numerous world leaders to St. Peter's Square. The service was held just five days after his death at the age of 88 due to heart failure and a stroke. This event marked the first time since 1903 that a former pope was not buried within the Vatican, as his body was interred at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. During the funeral mass, a procession led by a priest included a copy of the New Testament placed on the pope's coffin. Notable attendees included former U.S. Presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump, as well as leaders from over 110 nations.

The mass was presided over by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who delivered a homily reflecting on Francis' vision of the Church as a "field hospital" for the wounded. The ceremony included prayers in multiple languages and was adjusted to align with Francis' wishes for a simpler service. Following the mass, a group of "poor and needy" welcomed the coffin to its final resting place, representing Francis' dedication to the vulnerable. The public will be able to visit his tomb starting Sunday, with a period of mourning and daily masses planned for the following nine days.
