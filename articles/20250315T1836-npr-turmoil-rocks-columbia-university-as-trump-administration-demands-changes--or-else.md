## Article summary
Turmoil has erupted at Columbia University following an ultimatum from the Trump administration, which threatened to withdraw significant federal funding unless the university makes substantial changes. The administration specifically demanded that Columbia place its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership for at least five years, although the reasons for targeting this department were not disclosed. The letter from federal officials also called for reforms in student discipline policies, including expelling or suspending students involved in recent protests and establishing a formal definition of antisemitism. 

These demands come in the wake of a contentious environment at Columbia, exacerbated by the administration's previous cancellation of $400 million in federal grants due to alleged failures to address antisemitism amid pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The situation has been further complicated by the recent arrest of former student Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist, which has sparked protests and legal challenges. 

Columbia's interim president confirmed that the university is reviewing the federal letter and remains committed to ensuring a safe environment for all students. Critics argue that the administration's actions represent an attack on academic freedom and a broader effort to suppress dissent on college campuses. As the university navigates this crisis, it remains under scrutiny, not just from the federal government but also from civil rights groups and advocates for free speech.
