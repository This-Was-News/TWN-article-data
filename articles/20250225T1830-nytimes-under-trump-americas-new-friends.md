## Article summary
The article "Under Trump, America’s New Friends: Russia, North Korea and Belarus" discusses President Trump's foreign policy shifts during his second term, particularly his alignment with countries like Russia, North Korea, and Belarus, while distancing from traditional allies such as Britain, France, and Germany. Trump’s recent decision to vote against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine symbolizes this realignment, positioning the U.S. alongside international outliers. This shift raises concerns about the future of American foreign policy and could lead to European and Asian allies re-evaluating their alliances. 

Critics, including some Republicans, express alarm over Trump's stance, arguing it contradicts American ideals of freedom and democracy. Trump's administration defends his approach as a strategy for negotiating peace in Ukraine, despite the implications of alienating Ukraine's leadership. The article highlights Trump's historical admiration for autocrats, contrasting his approach to leaders like Putin and Kim Jong-un with his lack of support for democratic leaders like Ukraine’s Zelensky. 

The U.S. has rarely aligned with North Korea and Belarus on significant issues, making this shift particularly notable. The article concludes that Trump’s actions may be reshaping the global diplomatic landscape, creating a new alignment that favors authoritarian regimes over traditional democratic allies.
