## Article summary
President Trump announced new tariffs on various countries, set to take effect on August 7, unless they negotiate deals with the United States within a week. These tariffs range from 10% to 41%, with countries like Syria, Laos, and Myanmar facing the highest rates. The tariffs aim to address the U.S. trade deficit, which reached a record $1.2 trillion last year. The announcement has led to stock market declines in Asia and Europe, and has raised concerns about global economic uncertainty. Trump also imposed a 40% tariff on goods transshipped to avoid higher duties, targeting practices like those used by Chinese companies.
