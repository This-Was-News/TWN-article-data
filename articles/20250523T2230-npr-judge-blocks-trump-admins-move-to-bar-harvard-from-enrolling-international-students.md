## Article summary
A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to revoke Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. This legal action came after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would terminate Harvard's certification for enrolling these students. Harvard's lawsuit claims the revocation violates the First Amendment and retaliates against the university for resisting government control over its governance and curriculum. Before the judge's ruling, DHS instructed current international students to transfer to other universities to maintain their visa status. Harvard has approximately 7,000 international students, constituting about 27% of its student body. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of fostering violence and antisemitism, and of colluding with the Chinese Communist Party. Harvard's president condemned the administration's actions as unlawful, warning of the broader implications for international students across the U.S. The uncertainty surrounding their status raises concerns about the U.S.'s reputation as a welcoming destination for international education. International students significantly contribute to the U.S. economy, with nearly $44 billion spent in the last academic year.
