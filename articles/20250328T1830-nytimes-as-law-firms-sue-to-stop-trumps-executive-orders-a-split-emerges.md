## Article summary
Law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration to block executive orders that threaten their ability to represent clients. These lawsuits reflect a division within the legal profession, with some firms choosing to resist Trump's attacks while others, like Skadden and Paul Weiss, have opted to negotiate with the administration. Trump's executive orders target firms that he perceives as adversaries, potentially stripping lawyers of security clearances and limiting their access to federal buildings. Jenner & Block argues that the orders are unconstitutional and have already been deemed unlawful by a federal court.

The lawsuits seek immediate relief to prevent the orders from taking effect, highlighting the firms' commitment to advocate for their clients' rights. In contrast, Paul Weiss reached a deal with Trump, committing to pro bono services in exchange for the rescission of an executive order against them. Critics of the deals argue that they represent capitulation to political pressure. The executive orders are based on Trump's claims that certain law firms have weaponized the legal system against him, particularly those involved in investigations related to his campaign. The actions of Jenner & Block and WilmerHale signal a willingness to challenge these executive orders in defense of legal principles and client representation.
