## Article summary
Robert Francis Prevost was elected as the 267th pope of the Roman Catholic Church, taking the name Pope Leo XIV, making him the first American pope. His election, which defied longstanding beliefs about the selection of popes from global superpowers, was met with joy in both Vatican City and his hometown of Chicago. In his inaugural address, he emphasized peace, justice, and building bridges within the church and the world. Prevost, who spent over two decades in Peru, is seen as a balanced figure amid ideological divides within the church, likely continuing the inclusive agenda of his predecessor, Pope Francis. World leaders have congratulated him, expressing hopes for peace and unity under his leadership. Prevost's previous social media activity indicated criticism of certain U.S. immigration policies, aligning with a more progressive stance. As a member of the Augustinian order, he is committed to serving the poor and marginalized. The election has sparked a mix of reactions, with American Catholics expressing pride while some others were surprised by the choice. Prevost's background includes a strong educational foundation in theology, and he is fluent in multiple languages. His papacy is viewed as a potential bridge between conservative and progressive factions within the church.
