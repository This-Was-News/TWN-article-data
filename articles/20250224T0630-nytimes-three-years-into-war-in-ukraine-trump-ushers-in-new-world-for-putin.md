## Article summary
The article discusses the shifting dynamics of the Russia-Ukraine war three years in, particularly in light of Donald Trump's return to power in the U.S. President Vladimir Putin perceives new opportunities to reshape the geopolitical landscape following Trump's election. The previous U.S. administration's strong stance against Russia has been replaced by Trump's inclination for rapprochement, raising concerns among European allies about U.S. commitments to NATO and their own security. Analysts suggest that this shift could embolden Putin to pursue his long-standing goal of undermining NATO and expanding Russia's influence in Europe.

Despite some territorial gains in Ukraine, Russia faces significant challenges, including heavy military casualties and economic strains. The article notes that while there are opportunities for Putin, the complexities of international negotiations and domestic U.S. sentiments against Russia complicate the situation. Public opinion in the U.S. remains largely negative towards Putin, making any perceived concessions to him politically risky for Trump. Furthermore, the article highlights the rise of pro-Kremlin narratives in right-wing media, contrasting with the West's initial unity against Russian aggression. Overall, the evolving political landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Putin as he navigates a changing world order.
