## Article summary
Widespread layoffs are taking place at federal health agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Trump administration has initiated these cuts, affecting approximately 10,000 employees, following earlier reductions of a similar scale. Termination notices were sent out on April 1, 2025, with many employees learning of their dismissal only upon being denied access to their workplaces.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the layoffs aim to reduce "bureaucratic sprawl" and realign the organization with its core mission. However, many within the agencies express concern that these cuts threaten public health, biomedical research, and the ability to respond to health crises. The FDA has seen significant changes, including the loss of its communications team and the departure of key officials, raising alarms about the agency's future effectiveness.

At the NIH, around 1,200 jobs are expected to be cut, with many high-ranking officials reassigned, leading to a sense of despair among remaining staff. The Administration for Community Living and the Office of Energy Assistance also faced severe staff reductions, jeopardizing programs that support vulnerable populations. Critics, including members of Congress, have condemned the layoffs as an unprecedented attack on the federal health workforce, warning that healthcare services will be adversely affected.
