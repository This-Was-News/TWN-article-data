## Article summary
The recent closure of a tariff loophole, known as the de minimis exemption, will significantly impact prices for American shoppers purchasing goods from Shein and Temu. Since 2016, items valued under $800 could be imported without tariffs or customs paperwork, but this exemption is now being eliminated specifically for goods from mainland China and Hong Kong. The change, aimed at curbing the influx of fentanyl, has already led to increased prices for imported items. For instance, shoppers on Temu have noted substantial import charges added to their carts, with some items experiencing price hikes even before the official tariff change takes effect. Shein has also seen price increases, with customers reporting higher costs for summer dresses shortly before the exemption ends. The new tariffs may vary based on shipping methods, with express carriers facing higher rates. Additionally, while the de minimis goods will still not require a Social Security number, they will now be classified as informal entry imports. The transition could lead to delays in package processing, as Customs and Border Protection prepares to manage a larger volume of shipments. Overall, consumers can expect to pay significantly more for Chinese goods moving forward.
