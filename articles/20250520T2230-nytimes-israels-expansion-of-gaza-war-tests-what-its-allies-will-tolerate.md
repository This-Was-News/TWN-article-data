## Article summary
Britain, France, and Canada have condemned Israel's escalation of the Gaza war, marking a significant shift in the stance of these Western allies. They criticized Israel's military offensive and humanitarian blockade, which has left the Palestinian population at risk of famine. The three countries suspended free-trade talks with Israel and issued a joint statement deeming the escalation "wholly disproportionate." The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire, with U.N. officials warning that thousands of babies could die without immediate aid. Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu responded by accusing the allies of aiding Hamas and reaffirming Israel's intent to continue its military actions. The rising Palestinian death toll, reported at over 53,000, has strained diplomatic support for Israel, contrasting sharply with initial backing after the October 7 attacks. The U.S. has not publicly criticized Israel's actions, but President Trump acknowledged the suffering in Gaza and expressed a desire to help. European officials are increasingly frustrated with Israel, with discussions underway about potentially suspending the EU's association agreement with Israel due to human rights concerns. France's foreign minister warned that continued aggression could lead to significant diplomatic consequences for Israel. Overall, the situation remains tense as humanitarian conditions worsen and international criticism mounts.
