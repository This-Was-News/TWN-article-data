## Article summary
A man in northern Idaho intentionally set a fire on Canfield Mountain and ambushed responding firefighters, resulting in the deaths of two and injuries to a third. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris confirmed that the body of the suspected shooter was found on the mountain, along with a weapon, and indicated that the shootings were deliberate. The incident began with reports of a wildfire at 1:21 p.m., followed by gunfire directed at firefighters at 2 p.m. A cell phone signal led authorities to discover the suspect's body later that day. Norris stated that there was no ongoing threat to the community and emphasized that the firefighters were untrained for ambush scenarios. Idaho Governor Brad Little condemned the attack, labeling it a "heinous direct assault" on firefighters. The investigation will continue, with the possibility of more weapons being discovered. Authorities are still determining the motive and have not confirmed if the suspect died by suicide. The crime scene has been compromised due to the fire, but the recovery of the body was prioritized for the investigation.
