## Article summary
The article discusses expectations for Donald Trump's upcoming address to Congress, drawing insights from his previous State of the Union speech in 2020. That address, delivered amidst his first impeachment and the early spread of COVID-19, was characterized by a mix of drama and entertainment, likened to reality TV and a gameshow. Analysts anticipate Trump will again focus on his political achievements and assertive messaging, especially with a Republican majority in Congress. 

The 2020 speech featured several surprising moments, such as the awarding of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh and the emotional reunion of a military family, highlighting Trump's performative style. Critics noted that Trump's speeches often prioritize spectacle over traditional presidential decorum. 

As he prepares for the upcoming address, expectations are for more unconventional moments and a continuation of his assertive "Get on board or get out of the way" approach. Observers predict that Trump's knack for drama will keep the address engaging and unpredictable, ensuring it remains anything but boring.
