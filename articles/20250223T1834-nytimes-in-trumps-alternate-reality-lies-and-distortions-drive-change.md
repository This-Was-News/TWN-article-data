## Article summary
The article from The New York Times discusses how former President Trump employs lies and distortions to reshape political narratives and justify his policy decisions in his second term. It highlights several false claims he has made, such as the U.S. sending $50 million in condoms to Hamas and asserting that Ukraine started the war with Russia. Trump's manipulation of truth is characterized as creating an "alternative reality" that serves to legitimize his actions and undermine opposition. Scholars note that his tactics resemble those seen in authoritarian regimes, using propaganda and misinformation to control the narrative.

The piece emphasizes Trump's ability to shape public perception, often leading his aides to conform to his distorted views. His repeated assertions, even when debunked, create a strategic advantage by setting the terms of debate. The article also points out how Trump's claims about U.S. aid to Ukraine are exaggerated and misleading, illustrating his broader pattern of misinformation. Ultimately, the analysis portrays Trump as a skilled propagandist who thrives on creating chaos around factual discourse, thereby consolidating his power and influence.
