Moyers later became known for his thoughtful and earnest approach to journalism, exploring issues like poverty, democracy, and the influence of money in politics, earning over 30 Emmy Awards throughout his career. His PBS series, "Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth," significantly popularized mythological themes and drew large audiences.

He had a complex relationship with Johnson, ultimately resigning due to political disagreements and family obligations. Throughout his career, he produced impactful documentaries and hosted programs that examined critical social issues.
