## Article summary
The New York Times article discusses the impact of a stopgap spending bill being pushed by Republicans in Congress, which omits approximately $13 billion in earmarks for individual projects. These earmarks, intended for community improvements like airport renovations and mentorship programs, were excluded as lawmakers aimed to prevent a government shutdown. The decision reflects a broader trend of Congress ceding its power over federal spending to the Trump administration, limiting members' ability to direct funds to local initiatives. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed disappointment over the loss of funding for critical community projects.

Earmarks, which were previously banned due to concerns over waste and corruption, were reinstated in 2021 with stricter rules and transparency requirements. However, the current funding measure has reignited debates about their value, with some lawmakers supporting their exclusion as a necessary fiscal restraint amid rising national debt. Despite the setbacks, many lawmakers plan to resubmit their earmark requests in future funding cycles. Overall, the article highlights the ongoing struggle within Congress to balance fiscal responsibility with the needs of constituents.
