## Article summary
The Trump administration has initiated a significant reduction in workforce at the U.S. Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.), firing 2,000 employees and placing many foreign service officers on paid leave. This decision follows a court ruling that allows the administration to proceed with plans to dismantle the agency. The mass layoffs are part of a broader strategy to freeze U.S. foreign aid and overhaul the agency's operations. Employees working on critical programs and core leadership roles are exempt from the layoffs. The agency's new leadership, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and deputy Pete Marocco, is implementing these changes amidst concerns about the continuity of humanitarian assistance programs. Previously, about 400 contractor employees involved in urgent aid were also let go, raising doubts about the administration's commitment to such initiatives. The email communication regarding the layoffs indicated that employees returning from overseas would have their travel expenses covered. Despite promises of continued foreign aid post-review, details about the process remain unclear. The situation has led to anxiety among employees, particularly those stationed abroad, who fear further job losses upon their return to the U.S.
