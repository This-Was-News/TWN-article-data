## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has endorsed the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, a move that has incited backlash from anti-vaccine supporters. In a social media post, he emphasized the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing measles, especially during an ongoing outbreak in Texas that has resulted in multiple deaths. His endorsement aligns with scientific evidence, which shows a high efficacy rate for the MMR vaccine. However, many anti-vaccine activists expressed their anger, feeling that Kennedy's statement contradicted his previous skepticism about vaccines. Prominent figures in the anti-vaccine community criticized him for "parroting" the medical establishment rather than challenging it. Kennedy's past involvement with anti-vaccine organizations has led to skepticism about his recent shift in stance. Despite the controversy, some health experts welcomed his endorsement, acknowledging its potential to influence public perception positively. Nevertheless, concerns remain about the outbreak's escalation, with experts warning that it is not being adequately controlled. Kennedy has also promoted alternative therapies, which experts argue are ineffective for treating measles. Overall, his endorsement has sparked significant debate within the health community and among his supporters.
