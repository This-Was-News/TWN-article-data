## Article summary
President Vladimir Putin has indicated that Russia may capture more territory in Ukraine, specifically mentioning the city of Sumy as a potential target, although he claims there is no specific goal to seize it. He reiterated the idea that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, framing the conflict as a justification for territorial claims. Despite Russia's annexation of four regions, Putin has not provided clear plans for further annexations and has rejected calls for a cease-fire. The Kremlin has linked improved U.S.-Russia relations to the resolution of the conflict, but insists on discussing these matters separately.

Recent Russian military actions have intensified, with drone strikes causing casualties in Ukrainian cities. Negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian representatives have yielded minimal progress, primarily focusing on prisoner exchanges. Meanwhile, U.S. diplomatic efforts under President Trump have shifted attention to other conflicts, such as the situation in Iran and Israel, due to stagnation in peace talks. The economic outlook in Russia is grim, with warnings of a potential recession, prompting Putin to urge government officials to avoid economic stagnation. The St. Petersburg economic conference aimed to attract Western investment but saw little interest from American businesses.
