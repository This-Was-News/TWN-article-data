## Article summary
Hamas has expressed readiness to engage in negotiations for a 60-day cease-fire with Israel, responding positively to a new proposal. The proposal includes hostage-for-prisoner swaps and aims for a permanent resolution to the ongoing conflict, which began with a Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023. President Trump indicated that Israel agreed to the conditions for a temporary truce and urged Hamas to follow suit. The main challenge remains the permanence of any cease-fire, as Hamas demands a lasting end to hostilities before releasing hostages, while Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu insists on dismantling Hamas's military capabilities. The new proposal entails the handover of 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 others in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with releases occurring in stages. The United States, along with Arab mediators Qatar and Egypt, will oversee negotiations during the truce. Netanyahu's government faces pressure from far-right coalition members against ending the war, even as his popularity has risen following military actions against Iran. Hamas's leadership has shifted to Izz al-Din al-Haddad, who opposes dislodging the group from power and has stated terms for negotiations, including Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and lifting restrictions. The situation remains complex, with both sides having previously come close to agreements that ultimately fell apart.
