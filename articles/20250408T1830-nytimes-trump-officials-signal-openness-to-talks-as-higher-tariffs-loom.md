## Article summary
The Trump administration has decided to maintain a 104% tariff on Chinese goods while signaling openness to negotiate with various countries seeking to roll back these levies. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer noted that 70 governments have approached the U.S. for discussions, but President Trump emphasized that negotiations would not halt the impending tariffs, including a new 50% duty on China. Trump defended the tariffs as necessary for revitalizing American manufacturing, despite concerns from economists about a potential recession. While some officials express optimism about negotiations, others, like trade adviser Peter Navarro, argue that the situation is a national emergency rather than a negotiation. Bipartisan pushback is growing in Congress, with some senators planning to introduce resolutions to terminate the emergency declaration that enabled the tariffs. Retail leaders warn that these tariffs could lead to increased prices for consumers, while Democrats criticize Trump's economic management. Despite the challenges, some Republicans remain hopeful that negotiations may yield beneficial outcomes. Overall, the political landscape around the tariffs is marked by significant tension and uncertainty.
