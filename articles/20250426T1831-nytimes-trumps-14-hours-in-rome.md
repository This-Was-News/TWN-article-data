## Article summary
President Trump visited Rome briefly to attend Pope Francis' funeral and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during this time. Their 15-minute meeting took place in St. Peter's Basilica, marking their first encounter since a contentious Oval Office meeting in February. While the discussion was described as "productive," details were scarce, although Zelensky noted they talked about security guarantees to prevent further Russian aggression. Trump emphasized the need for high-level talks between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin to finalize a peace deal. 

Russia claimed to have regained territory in Kursk, while Ukraine denied full withdrawal of its forces. The U.S. presented a cease-fire plan that would recognize Russian control over seized territories, which Zelensky rejected, proposing instead terms that would demand reparations from Russia. During his trip, Trump criticized previous U.S. administrations for Ukraine's situation and threatened new sanctions against Russia. The meeting was seen as symbolic, with Zelensky expressing gratitude despite their disagreements. Trump’s quick departure left no room for further discussions, highlighting the urgency of the ongoing conflict.
