## Article summary
On a recent Monday evening, as few as three air traffic controllers managed the airspace for Newark Liberty International Airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This staffing level was significantly below the target of 14 controllers, as stipulated in an agreement with the controllers' union. The FAA acknowledged the low staffing but emphasized that safety would not be compromised. The reduced number of controllers has contributed to ongoing delays and cancellations at Newark, one of the busiest airports in the U.S., due to a combination of technological issues, worker shortages, and runway construction. 

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stressed that the FAA's measures to slow flight operations are aimed at ensuring safety, not inconveniencing travelers. The air traffic control responsibilities for Newark were shifted from Long Island to Philadelphia last summer, which has faced criticism for not addressing arising technical problems. The Philadelphia facility has a total of 22 certified controllers and five supervisors, alongside trainees. While the controller shortage raises concerns, experts indicate that it does not inherently threaten passenger safety, although it can lead to increased stress and fatigue among staff. Recent communication outages have further complicated operations, prompting some controllers to take leave due to stress. Duffy has also announced plans for a major overhaul of the national air traffic control system, which he described as "antiquated."
