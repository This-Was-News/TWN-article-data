## Article summary
President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erka McEntarfer has sparked controversy, with Trump alleging that the July jobs report was "RIGGED" to make Republicans look bad. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the move, stating that Trump wants his own people in the role to ensure more transparent and reliable numbers. Former BLS Commissioner William Beach, who served during Trump's first term, argued that the decision has damaged the agency's credibility and that the jobs numbers cannot be manipulated. Beach explained that the BLS commissioner has no involvement in the collection or processing of the data, which is designed to prevent political interference. He also noted that large revisions in jobs reports are not unusual, especially during economic turning points, and that the revisions aim to make the numbers more accurate. Beach expressed concern that distrust in statistics could create uncertainty in financial markets and negatively impact the economy.
