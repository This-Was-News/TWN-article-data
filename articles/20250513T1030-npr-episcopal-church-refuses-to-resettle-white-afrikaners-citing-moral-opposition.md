## Article summary
The Episcopal Church has announced the termination of its nearly 40-year partnership with the U.S. government for refugee resettlement, specifically opposing the resettlement of white Afrikaners from South Africa. This decision, articulated by Presiding Bishop Sean W. Rowe, stems from the church's moral stance against classifying Afrikaners as refugees, citing its commitment to racial justice and historical ties to the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. The announcement coincided with the arrival of Afrikaners in the U.S. following a Trump administration executive order aimed at admitting them as victims of racial discrimination. 

Rowe emphasized that while the church will wind down federally funded services by September, it will continue to support other immigrants and refugees. The church's decision reflects its long-standing advocacy against apartheid and its historical divestment from South Africa in the 1980s. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has largely frozen the refugee program, prioritizing Afrikaners while neglecting other refugee populations in need. Critics argue that this selective resettlement demonstrates the government's capacity to process refugees, urging it to honor commitments to all vulnerable groups. Faith-based organizations have expressed frustration over the government's actions, highlighting the urgent need for broader refugee resettlement efforts.
