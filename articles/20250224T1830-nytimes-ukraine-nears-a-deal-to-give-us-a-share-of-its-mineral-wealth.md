## Article summary
Ukraine is nearing an agreement with the United States that would allow Washington to receive a share of Ukraine's revenues from its natural resources. President Trump announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky might visit the White House soon to finalize the deal. The negotiations have progressed significantly, with Ukrainian officials confirming they are in the final stages. The latest draft of the agreement offers more favorable terms for Ukraine compared to previous versions, although it does not include the security guarantees Ukraine has been seeking amid ongoing Russian aggression.

The deal would require Ukraine to share half of its future revenues from natural resources, which would be directed to a fund benefiting U.S. interests, but it would not necessitate repayment of past aid or future commitments. The absence of security guarantees remains a contentious point, as Zelensky has emphasized the need for Western support to ensure Ukraine's future safety. The U.S. administration argues that American economic involvement in Ukraine could deter Russian aggression, even without explicit security provisions. This agreement is tied to broader discussions on military and financial aid to Ukraine amid the conflict with Russia.
