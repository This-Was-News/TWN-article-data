## Article summary
A federal investigation by the Trump administration has concluded that Harvard University violated federal civil rights law by not adequately protecting Jewish students from anti-Semitic harassment. The findings suggest that Harvard has been both deliberately indifferent and a willing participant in such discrimination. As a result, the university risks losing additional federal funding. Harvard disputes these findings, asserting that it is actively working to combat anti-Semitism and support its Jewish community. The investigation, conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights, identified a pattern of unlawful discrimination on campus since October 7, 2023. Harvard's own task force on anti-Semitism provided evidence that was referenced in the federal review. The university has previously faced over $2 billion in federal funds being frozen or canceled due to disputes with the administration and is currently involved in ongoing litigation. A hearing for this case is scheduled for mid-July. Harvard maintains its commitment to ensuring the safety and respect of its Jewish and Israeli community members.
