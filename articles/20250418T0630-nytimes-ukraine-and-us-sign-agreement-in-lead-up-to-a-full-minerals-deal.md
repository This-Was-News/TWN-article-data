## Article summary
Ukraine and the United States signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at establishing a joint economic partnership, moving closer to a minerals deal after contentious negotiations. The agreement, announced by Ukraine's economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko, lacks specific details, particularly regarding the funding for a proposed reconstruction investment fund. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated expectations for a full deal next week, which may mirror earlier proposals that granted the U.S. significant access to Ukraine's natural resources. Previous drafts had faced criticism and negotiations stalled after a public disagreement between the two nations' leaders. The anticipated deal could potentially yield $500 billion for the U.S. from Ukraine's underdeveloped rare earth deposits. While the memorandum hints at redirecting natural resource revenues to the fund, it does not clarify revenue sources or include U.S. security support commitments. Svyrydenko emphasized the agreement's importance for reaffirming American investment in a secure Ukraine. A final agreement will require ratification by both U.S. Congress and the Ukrainian Parliament. The U.S. has been Ukraine's largest supplier of military aid amid ongoing conflict with Russia.
