## Article summary
The Trump administration's handling of immigrant work visas has caused significant concern among employers in seasonal industries, such as resorts and agriculture, who rely on H-2B and H-2A visas to fill labor shortages. With the cap on H-2B visas reached, industry lobbyists have urged Congress to act, fearing delays in workforce planning for the summer. Although the administration recently announced the continuation of these visas, uncertainty looms over future immigration policies as deportations increase and legal statuses of many immigrants are threatened. Business leaders argue for a balance between securing borders and expanding legal immigration channels. Proposals like the Dignity Act aim to provide pathways to legal residency for undocumented workers while reforming visa programs. Despite bipartisan support for certain measures, Republican lawmakers await clearer direction from the White House on immigration reform. As deportations and the loss of work permits rise, employers face growing challenges in maintaining their workforce, particularly in agriculture, where the demand for H-2A workers is surging. The current political climate has shifted toward a more restrictive immigration stance, but some believe there may still be opportunities for comprehensive reform if Trump seeks a significant achievement in this area.
