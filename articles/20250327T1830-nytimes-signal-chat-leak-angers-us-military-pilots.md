## Article summary
The leak of sensitive military chat discussions on the Signal app has sparked outrage among U.S. military pilots, who are concerned about operational security. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's disclosure of attack plans, including specific timing for strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, has raised alarms about the safety of pilots. Current and former pilots expressed disbelief at Hegseth's refusal to acknowledge the severity of the breach, which they believe undermines decades of military protocol. The inclusion of a journalist in the chat has added to their concerns, as operational details were shared with individuals outside the military chain of command.

Pilots voiced that such disclosures could put their lives at risk, emphasizing the importance of keeping attack plans confidential. Hegseth defended his actions by claiming he provided real-time updates, but many in the military view his comments as reckless. Despite the Trump administration's assertion that the leaked information was not classified, military experts argue that revealing specific operational details could have dire consequences. Some retired military personnel are particularly frustrated, stating that such behavior from a high-ranking official is unacceptable. Overall, the incident has shaken pilots' trust in the Pentagon's commitment to their safety during missions.
