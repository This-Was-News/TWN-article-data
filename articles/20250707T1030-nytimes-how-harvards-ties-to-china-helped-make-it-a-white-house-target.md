## Article summary
Harvard University's financial recovery post-Great Recession involved significant ties with China, attracting $560 million in gifts and contracts from 2010 to 2025. Initially seen as a means to promote engagement and democratic ideals, these connections have since become contentious amid a shift in U.S. foreign policy toward a more hawkish stance on China. The Trump administration has targeted Harvard, stripping funding and questioning its ties to Chinese donors, framing them as national security risks. Although Harvard has reduced its connections, the administration continues to investigate its relationships with Chinese companies and donors. 

Despite the decline in Chinese donations since 2020, which fell to $30 million in 2024, international students still comprise a significant portion of Harvard's enrollment. The university has faced scrutiny for its past collaborations, particularly related to training Chinese officials and its engagement with state-owned enterprises. Prominent Chinese donors have also faced challenges, with some experiencing financial decline or legal issues. As political pressures mount, Harvard's Kennedy School and Chan School of Public Health have announced budget cuts and layoffs due to reduced funding. Overall, Harvard's historical ties to China have evolved into a complex landscape of opportunity and scrutiny amid changing geopolitical dynamics.
