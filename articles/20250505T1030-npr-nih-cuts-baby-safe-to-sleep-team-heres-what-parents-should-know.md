## Article summary
The NIH has discontinued its "Safe to Sleep" campaign, which has been instrumental in reducing sleep-related infant deaths, including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), for three decades. Initially launched as "Back to Sleep" in 1994, the campaign significantly lowered infant mortality rates by educating parents on safe sleep practices. The abrupt termination of the program by the Trump administration has raised concerns, especially as sleep-related deaths have recently increased by nearly 12% from 2020 to 2022, likely due to reduced access to safe sleep information during the pandemic. Experts, including Dr. Rachel Moon, express shock and disappointment over the decision, emphasizing the importance of the campaign's resources in preventing infant deaths. Nonprofits like First Candle plan to continue their educational efforts but lack the funding previously provided by the NIH. The NIH stated that no final decision has been made regarding the campaign's future, although many materials are currently unavailable for order. The cuts have left many worried about the potential consequences for new parents who may not receive essential safety information. The situation highlights the critical need for accessible resources to ensure infant safety during sleep.
