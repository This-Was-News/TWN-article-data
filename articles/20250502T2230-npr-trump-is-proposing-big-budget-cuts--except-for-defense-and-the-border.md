## Article summary
President Trump has proposed significant budget cuts totaling $163 billion for non-defense discretionary spending in the 2026 fiscal year, while exempting defense and border security from these reductions. The plan suggests an overall 22.6% decrease in projected spending, targeting agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Science Foundation for cuts exceeding 50%. Additionally, education funding would see a 15% reduction, although funding for early child care programs like Head Start would be maintained. 

The proposed budget also aims to eliminate several government agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In contrast, defense spending is slated for a 13% increase, and border security funding is expected to rise by 65%. While the budget serves as a guideline for Congress, it is not binding, and experts predict many proposed cuts will face challenges in Congress. 

The White House has collaborated closely with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, to implement prior spending reductions. Despite potential congressional pushback, Trump's administration may explore executive orders to enforce cuts if necessary.
