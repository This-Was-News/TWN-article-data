## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will aggressively revoke visas of Chinese students, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. This decision is expected to cause anxiety among the approximately 275,000 Chinese students in the U.S. and could lead to retaliatory actions from China. The specific fields deemed critical remain undefined, but they likely include physical sciences. Concerns have been raised about how the U.S. will identify students with Communist Party ties. American universities have historically benefited from international students, and the crackdown aligns with broader tensions between the U.S. and China, particularly regarding trade. Rubio also stated that the State Department would deny visas to foreign officials who censor American citizens. The announcement follows a previous visa cancellation for over 1,000 Chinese students linked to military universities. While the number of Chinese students in the U.S. has decreased, the overall international student population remains significant, with China contributing the second-largest share. Responses on Chinese social media to the visa revocation have been mixed, reflecting both resignation and a sense of triumph among nationalists.
