## Article summary
Senator Joni Ernst faced intense scrutiny during a town hall in Butler County, Iowa, where constituents expressed their dissatisfaction with her support for President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The atmosphere shifted quickly from a friendly introduction to a confrontational questioning regarding the bill's proposed cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Ernst defended the legislation, claiming that those removed from these programs were ineligible beneficiaries, which led to a heated response from the audience, including a comment about the potential for people to die as a result of these cuts. Ernst replied, "Well, we all are going to die," further inciting disapproval from the crowd. 

The GOP budget package aims to provide significant tax cuts for the wealthy while slashing funding for social programs, and it narrowly passed in the House. However, it faces challenges in the Senate, particularly over its impact on the national debt and social services. During the town hall, Ernst was also confronted by a Navy veteran about Trump's governing style, prompting more dissent from the audience. Despite the backlash, Ernst appeared unfazed after the event, sharing a message on social media expressing her appreciation for the constituents who attended. The event highlighted the growing tensions surrounding the proposed legislation and Ernst's controversial stance on social safety net programs.
