## Article summary
Israeli airstrikes targeted two major energy facilities in Tehran, hitting the Shahran gas depot and the Shahr Rey oil refinery, resulting in widespread explosions and fires. The Shahran depot, located in a wealthy neighborhood, contains at least 11 storage tanks, and residents reported terrifying scenes as explosions occurred. The strikes represent a significant escalation in Israel's military campaign against Iran, particularly affecting its energy infrastructure, which is vital for both exports and domestic supply. Earlier attacks included a key section of the South Pars Gas Field, crucial for Iran's energy production. Residents expressed fear and confusion, with one woman recounting a loud explosion that caused her mother to faint. Concerns about fuel shortages arose, as the attack threatened the city's gasoline supply. Iranian officials noted that the explosions could severely impact nearby residential areas, highlighting the risks associated with the depot's location. Discussions about relocating the Shahran depot had been ongoing due to fears of such attacks. Israeli defense officials also reported strikes on sites related to Iran's nuclear program. Israel has not commented on the recent strikes.
