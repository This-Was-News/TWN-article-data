## Article summary
The IRS has introduced a solution for electric vehicle (EV) buyers who were unable to claim their tax credits for 2024 due to dealers failing to report sales correctly. Previously, some customers discovered they couldn't access the EV tax credit because their dealers had not submitted necessary information through a new online portal within a three-day timeframe. The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) announced that the IRS is now allowing dealers to retroactively report qualifying sales, effectively waiving the previous deadline. This change was made available for testing on March 25 and is officially rolling out for dealers to utilize immediately. 

The NADA highlighted that both consumers and some dealers were affected by this issue, as some dealers had offered the tax credit upfront but failed to report the transactions in time. The IRS has not publicly commented on the matter but has not disputed the information provided by NADA. Taxpayers needing to benefit from this fix must work directly with the dealer who sold them the vehicle, as only dealers can access the ECO portal to submit sales data to the IRS. NADA has been advocating for this remedy and has informed Congress of the issue based on constituent feedback.
