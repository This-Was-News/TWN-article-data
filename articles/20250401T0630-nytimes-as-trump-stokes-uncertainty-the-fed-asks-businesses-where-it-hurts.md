## Article summary
The Federal Reserve is grappling with heightened uncertainty in the economy as businesses express caution due to President Trump's trade and immigration policies. Chris Bergen, a greenhouse owner, highlights the impact of potential tariffs on costs and labor availability, leading him to reconsider expansion plans. Similarly, other business leaders report rising costs and reduced orders, raising fears of an impending recession. The Fed is trying to gauge the extent of these policy effects on inflation and economic growth, with mixed signals from hard data indicating stability and soft data reflecting consumer pessimism. 

As businesses delay investments and hiring, the Fed's challenge lies in balancing inflation control with fostering economic growth. While some officials project interest rate cuts in response to growth concerns, others warn of a stagflationary shock due to rising inflation expectations. The Fed's decisions are complicated by the need to monitor how inflation expectations evolve amid slowing growth. Overall, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies creates a precarious environment for both businesses and monetary policy.
