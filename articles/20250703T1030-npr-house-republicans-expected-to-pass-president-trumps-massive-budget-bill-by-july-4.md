## Article summary
House Republicans are on the verge of passing President Trump's significant budget bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, by a self-imposed July 4 deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson successfully gathered the necessary votes, overcoming opposition from five holdouts, with the final count at 219 to 213. The legislation aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, temporarily eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, and increase defense and immigration spending, while raising the national debt limit by $5 trillion. To fund these initiatives, the bill proposes cuts to various programs, notably Medicaid, which could result in approximately 11 million people losing coverage. This nearly 1,000-page bill represents a substantial shift in federal policy, reallocating resources from the social safety net and clean energy investments towards tax cuts and defense. Following floor debates, lawmakers will proceed to a final vote, anticipated to happen soon. Despite the expected passage, Democrats are preparing to use this legislation as a focal point in their campaign to regain control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. The ongoing negotiations and internal divisions within the Republican Party highlight the contentious nature of the bill. Overall, the bill reflects a dramatic realignment of government priorities in American life.
