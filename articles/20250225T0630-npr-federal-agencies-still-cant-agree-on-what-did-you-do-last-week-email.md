## Article summary
Federal agencies are experiencing confusion over Elon Musk's directive for employees to report five accomplishments from the previous week, following a government-wide email from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Various departments, including Defense, State, and Homeland Security, issued conflicting instructions, with some advising employees not to respond while others encouraged compliance. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) initially instructed staff to reply but later retracted this, stating that responding was not mandatory. OPM's updated guidance indicated that responses were voluntary, but many employees felt pressured to comply due to fears of repercussions. The situation has led to widespread confusion among federal workers, with some expressing frustration over the lack of clear leadership and guidance. Musk and Trump have made statements suggesting that noncompliance could result in job loss, further complicating the matter. Unions are taking legal action against the administration's directives, arguing that OPM lacks the authority to manage responses from employees of other agencies. As the deadline for responses looms, the chaos has left many federal employees feeling uncertain about their obligations and job security.
