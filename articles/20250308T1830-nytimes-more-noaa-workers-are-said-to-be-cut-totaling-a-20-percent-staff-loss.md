## Article summary
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is facing significant staff reductions, with plans to cut an additional 1,000 employees, which would amount to a 20% decrease in its workforce of approximately 13,000. This move comes as part of broader cuts mandated by the Trump administration, raising concerns among scientists and meteorologists about the agency's ability to provide essential weather forecasts as hurricane season approaches. Recent resignations and layoffs have already strained NOAA's operations, leading to the suspension of critical activities like launching weather balloons.

NOAA managers have been instructed to propose layoffs and reorganizations, although they have received little guidance on which programs to prioritize for cuts. These reductions are part of a larger agenda that some Trump allies advocate, suggesting NOAA's functions should be dismantled or privatized. The potential impact of these cuts could jeopardize public safety and disrupt various industries reliant on NOAA's forecasts.

Employees at NOAA are experiencing heightened anxiety due to unannounced firings and frozen government-issued credit cards, hindering their ability to conduct research. The administration's actions have sparked protests nationwide, with scientists expressing fears that the integrity of American scientific leadership is being undermined. Experts argue that private companies cannot effectively replace NOAA's forecasting capabilities, emphasizing the coordinated effort required between public and private sectors for accurate weather predictions.
