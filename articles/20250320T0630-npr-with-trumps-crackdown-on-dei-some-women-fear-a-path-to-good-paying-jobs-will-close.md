## Article summary
The article discusses concerns among women regarding job opportunities in the wake of President Trump's revocation of Executive Order 11246, which mandated federal contractors to address barriers to employment for women and people of color. Lauren Sugerman, who benefited from this order in her career, fears that the progress made since its implementation will be undone. Trump's executive order aims to eliminate what he describes as "illegal DEI" practices, which he claims undermine merit-based opportunities and traditional values. This move is expected to dismantle the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, reducing oversight on compliance with civil rights laws.

Federal contractors, employing 20% of the U.S. workforce, are now left uncertain about how to navigate the changes while remaining compliant with existing non-discrimination laws. The article highlights that despite previous progress, women still comprise less than 5% of the construction workforce, emphasizing the importance of initiatives aimed at increasing female representation in high-paying jobs. Activists warn that the end of EO 11246 could lead to a significant setback for civil rights efforts, leaving women and people of color with fewer protections and opportunities in the job market.
