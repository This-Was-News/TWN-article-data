## Article summary
President Trump announced a new travel ban on 12 countries, with partial restrictions on seven others, effective June 9. The White House stated that the ban aims to protect the U.S. from terrorist threats due to inadequate screening from the listed nations, which include Afghanistan, Iran, and Libya. Trump highlighted a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, as justification for the ban, despite the attacker being from a non-restricted country. 

Shawn VanDiver, from a nonprofit aiding Afghan resettlement, criticized the ban for blocking many Afghans with pending cases from safety, regardless of their loyalty to the U.S. This ban follows an executive order Trump signed upon returning to the White House, which sought to identify countries with insufficient vetting processes. 

Trump previously campaigned on reinstating his earlier travel ban, which faced significant legal challenges and public outcry when first enacted in 2017. The original ban targeted seven Muslim-majority countries and was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court after several revisions. In 2021, President Biden rescinded the ban, but the new restrictions indicate a potential return to similar policies.
