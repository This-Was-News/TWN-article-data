## Article summary
The article discusses increasing allegations of racial profiling during immigration raids in Los Angeles, particularly targeting Hispanic individuals. Emma de Paz was handcuffed and detained by immigration agents while selling food outside a Home Depot, despite having no prior questioning about her legal status. Her brother, Carlos Barrera, asserts that she was arrested solely based on her appearance. Advocates claim that immigration agents are conducting these raids in violation of constitutional protections, often rounding up individuals without reasonable suspicion. ACLU representatives describe the situation as "open season" on immigrants, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of these operations. The Department of Homeland Security denies these claims, stating that their operations are targeted and based on prior knowledge. Legal experts argue that agents must have specific, articulable facts to justify arrests, which they often lack. The article also recounts the experience of Javier Ramirez, a U.S. citizen detained during a raid, who expressed his distress over being targeted due to his Hispanic appearance. Ramirez's case, along with others, has prompted a federal class action lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these immigration practices. The community's fear and trauma from these raids are evident, with ongoing protests against such actions.
