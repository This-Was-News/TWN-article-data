## Article summary
The article discusses the implications of President Trump's immigration crackdown on public perceptions of immigrants and crime. Critics argue that the administration prioritizes optics over effective policy, creating a narrative that portrays immigrants as criminals. Despite claims of success, recent data reveals that a significant portion of those detained, particularly Venezuelan migrants, are classified as low-threat individuals without serious criminal records. An NPR/Ipsos poll indicates that misinformation about immigrants is prevalent, especially among those consuming conservative media, leading to beliefs that immigrants commit more crimes than native-born citizens. Experts express concern that the administration's media-centric approach reinforces these misperceptions, with Trump likened to a reality show producer staging enforcement actions for public consumption. This strategy appears to resonate with a substantial segment of the population, embedding false narratives into their worldview. The article emphasizes the potential dangers of conflating media representation with reality in shaping immigration policy and public opinion. Overall, the piece highlights the complex interplay between political messaging, media influence, and societal beliefs regarding immigration.
