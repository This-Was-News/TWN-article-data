## Article summary
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Governor Greg Abbott are seeking court orders to remove state House Democrats who broke quorum by leaving the state, potentially allowing Abbott to appoint replacements. Paxton declared that Democrats who do not return to the House by Friday will have abandoned their offices, while Abbott filed an emergency petition to the Texas Supreme Court seeking the removal of Democratic lawmaker Gene Wu. Wu defended the Democrats' actions, stating they were fulfilling their oath and opposing Abbott's agenda. Legal experts question whether Abbott has the authority to appoint replacements and whether courts will rule in favor of the Democrats being deemed to have abandoned their offices. The dispute stems from Democrats' efforts to block a Republican-backed congressional redistricting map, with Abbott also directing investigations into the Democrats for potential felony bribery and political corruption.
