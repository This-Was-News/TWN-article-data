## Article summary
The article discusses the effectiveness of America's Massive Ordnance Penetrator (GBU-57) in a recent strike on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility. Despite claims of total destruction, a classified assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that the bombs only caused limited damage, setting back Iran's program by a few months. The White House disputes this assessment, asserting that the bombs would have resulted in obliteration. Historical context is provided, referencing past efforts to develop powerful earth-penetrating weapons, such as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, which was ultimately abandoned due to technical limitations. 

The penetration capabilities of the GBU-57 are analyzed, revealing that its effectiveness greatly depends on the type of rock it strikes. Calculations show that in medium-strength rock, the bomb could penetrate only about 7.9 meters, far short of the claimed 60 meters needed to reach the depth of Fordo. Geological variations could also alter the bomb's trajectory and blast effectiveness. American military planners deployed 12 GBU-57s in an attempt to maximize impact, but geological factors likely mitigated their success. Ultimately, the article suggests that deeper fortifications may render such bunker-busting efforts ineffective.
