## Article summary
Senator Alex Padilla, D-Calif., delivered an emotional speech on the Senate floor recounting his forceful removal from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press conference last week. The event, led by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, addressed the Trump administration's response to immigration protests in Los Angeles. Padilla attended the conference after a scheduled meeting was delayed, but when he attempted to question Noem, he was physically removed by officials, handcuffed, and detained without explanation. He criticized the DHS's initial accusation of "disrespectful political theatre" and described his detainment as a turning point in the administration's "undemocratic crackdown" on protests. 

Padilla condemned comments made by Noem that suggested federal forces were meant to "liberate" Los Angeles from democratically elected officials. He characterized this statement as an "un-American mission statement" and urged his colleagues to resist such tactics. Highlighting his background as the son of Mexican immigrants and his journey into politics, Padilla emphasized the importance of American voices in the face of governmental overreach. He warned that if the president can deploy military forces without justification in one area, it could happen anywhere. His address aimed to rally support against the administration's actions and advocate for the rights of peaceful protesters.
