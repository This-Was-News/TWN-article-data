## Article summary
Higher prices for various grocery items are anticipated due to new tariffs announced by President Trump. Economists predict that items such as seafood, coffee, wine, nuts, and cheese will experience price increases. The tariffs, which affect a wide range of products, are expected to impact nearly half of the items in supermarkets. Seafood, primarily imported from countries like Chile and Vietnam, is likely to be significantly affected, as the U.S. imports about 85% of its seafood. Coffee, with major sources in Brazil and Colombia, and fruits from Guatemala and Costa Rica are also on the list of items expected to rise in price.

Alcohol, particularly wine from the European Union and beer from Mexico, will see price hikes due to tariffs, while beef and rice, despite being mostly domestically produced, may also face upward price pressures. Cheese imports from Europe are subject to tariffs as well, potentially driving up costs for popular varieties. Nuts, especially cashews and macadamia nuts from various countries, are expected to become more expensive. Additionally, olive oil prices, already high, are projected to increase further due to tariffs on imports from the EU. Overall, the combination of tariffs and other related economic factors will likely lead to higher grocery bills for consumers.
