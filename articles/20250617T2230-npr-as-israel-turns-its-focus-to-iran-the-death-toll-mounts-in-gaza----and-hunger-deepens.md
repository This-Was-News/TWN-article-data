## Article summary
As Israel intensifies its focus on Iran, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza escalates, with a rising death toll and deepening hunger. Recent attacks by Israeli military drones and artillery resulted in at least 59 Palestinian deaths on a single day, primarily as individuals sought food aid in Khan Younis. Since March, Israeli actions have led to over 400 fatalities among those attempting to access food, contributing to an overall death toll of nearly 55,500 in the ongoing conflict. The restrictions on aid are justified by Israel as a measure to prevent resources from benefiting Hamas, which currently holds hostages from the October 7, 2023, attack. The situation has plunged half a million people into starvation, with the risk of famine looming over the territory. Survivors recount harrowing experiences, with many witnessing horrific scenes while trying to obtain basic necessities. Nasser Hospital, the largest functioning medical facility in Gaza, struggles under overwhelming patient loads and limited resources, often needing to evacuate wards to accommodate the wounded. Aid distribution efforts are fraught with danger, as many have been killed near food distribution sites established by U.S. contractors. The United Nations has criticized the current aid distribution mechanisms, calling for urgent changes to prevent further loss of life.
