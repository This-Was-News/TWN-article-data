## Article summary
Ultra-processed foods, which are prevalent in today's food environment, can be particularly harmful to some children, especially those with a strong food reward drive. These children are more prone to overeating, struggle with satiety, and are at a higher risk of health problems like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Psychologists like Kerri Boutelle and Ashley Gearhardt emphasize that children with a strong food reward drive need different strategies to manage their eating habits. To help these children, experts recommend minimizing ultra-processed foods at home, allowing them only on special occasions, and teaching them to make healthier choices outside the home. Creating a safe eating environment and focusing on whole or minimally processed foods can significantly improve their health outcomes.
