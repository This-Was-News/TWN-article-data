## Article summary
Two employees from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have reportedly gained access to classified networks containing sensitive information about U.S. nuclear weapons. The individuals, Luke Farritor and Adam Ramada, have been associated with these networks for at least two weeks, despite lacking prior experience in handling classified information. The Department of Energy has denied these claims, asserting that the employees did not access the networks. However, sources indicate that their names were visible in the network directories, which are accessible to numerous personnel involved in nuclear operations.

The networks in question include the National Nuclear Security Administration's systems for transmitting detailed nuclear data and the Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). Access to these systems typically requires a high-level security clearance, and while the presence of DOGE employees could indicate increased privileges, it does not guarantee access to all classified information. Concerns have arisen regarding DOGE's handling of sensitive data, particularly following a whistleblower's claims about unauthorized access to internal systems at the National Labor Relations Board.

The situation has sparked scrutiny about the broader implications of DOGE's activities within government agencies, as well as potential security risks associated with their access to classified information.
