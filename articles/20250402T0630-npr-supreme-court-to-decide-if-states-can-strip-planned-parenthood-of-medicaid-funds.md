## Article summary
The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding whether South Carolina can exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from its Medicaid program, despite Medicaid funds not being used for abortions. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic operates two clinics in South Carolina that provide essential healthcare services, including cancer screenings and contraception, to low-income patients. In 2018, the state's Republican governor terminated Planned Parenthood's Medicaid participation, prompting the clinics to challenge this decision in court. Lower courts ruled that federal Medicaid law allows patients to choose qualified providers, which includes Planned Parenthood.

The state's argument is that federal regulations permit them to disqualify providers for any reason, citing taxpayer preferences against funding organizations that provide abortions. Planned Parenthood's representatives argue that the real issue is the state's dislike of the organization, not its qualifications. As the case reaches the Supreme Court, the critical question is whether Planned Parenthood is a qualified provider under Medicaid and what legal recourse is available for patients and providers if excluded. 

If the court rules in favor of South Carolina, it could lead to other states following suit, significantly reducing healthcare options for Medicaid patients. The case highlights the tension between state control and federal law regarding Medicaid provisions and patient rights.
