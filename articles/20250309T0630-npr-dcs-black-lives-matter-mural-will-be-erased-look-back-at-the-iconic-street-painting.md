## Article summary
Washington, D.C.'s Black Lives Matter mural, a significant symbol of activism since its creation in June 2020, is set to be removed following a legislative ultimatum from U.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde. The mural, painted in response to the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests, spans two blocks near the White House and was initially declared a permanent installation by Mayor Muriel Bowser. However, recent congressional interference has prompted the mayor to reverse her stance, stating that the city cannot be distracted by such actions. 

The mural became a prominent gathering place for various demonstrations, celebrating racial justice and mourning civil rights leaders like John Lewis. Despite its impact, the D.C. chapter of Black Lives Matter criticized the mural as a "performative distraction," while the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation condemned its removal as an erasure of truth. As preparations for the mural's removal begin, artists involved in its creation reflect on its legacy, acknowledging its role in inspiring global awareness and activism. The decision marks a controversial moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding racial justice and public art.
