## Article summary
A charter plane carrying 49 white South Africans, who claim to be victims of discrimination, departed for the U.S. after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration. This initiative marks a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, as Trump has largely halted refugee admissions from war-torn regions while creating a fast-tracked process for Afrikaners, a white ethnic group historically linked to apartheid. The refugees, facing job denials and violence due to their race, were seen leaving Johannesburg amid media restrictions and expressed mixed emotions about their departure. Critics, including immigrant rights activists and even some Afrikaner leaders, argue that the program undermines the refugee system meant for the most vulnerable and suggests support for better living conditions in South Africa instead. Tensions have risen between South Africa and the U.S. over this program, as the South African government perceives it as a politically motivated attack. The historical context includes unresolved land ownership issues stemming from apartheid, with Afrikaners controlling a significant portion of farmland despite being a small percentage of the population. Recent legislation in South Africa allows the government to seize land without compensation, raising fears among white farmers. Trump's past claims regarding land confiscation in South Africa have been deemed inaccurate. Overall, the situation highlights ongoing racial and economic disparities in post-apartheid South Africa.
