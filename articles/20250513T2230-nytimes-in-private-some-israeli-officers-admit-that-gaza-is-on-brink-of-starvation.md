## Article summary
Some Israeli military officials have privately acknowledged that Gaza is on the brink of widespread starvation unless aid deliveries are restored soon. Despite Israel's public stance that its blockade does not threaten civilian life, military officers warn that many areas are close to running out of food. The urgency of the humanitarian situation is highlighted by reports of bakeries closing and the United Nations World Food Program running out of food stocks. A U.N. initiative has warned that famine is imminent if military escalation continues. Israeli officials have indicated that the blockade aims to weaken Hamas, but aid groups argue that civilians are the primary victims of these restrictions. Reports of skyrocketing food prices and malnutrition among residents have emerged, with individuals struggling to access basic sustenance. Specialist officers have briefed military leadership on the critical situation, and plans are being explored to restart aid deliveries while avoiding Hamas. However, proposed plans to centralize food distribution have been criticized for potentially increasing civilian risk. Experts emphasize that enforcing a blockade that leads to starvation constitutes a violation of international law. The document reveals a significant disconnect between Israel's public narrative and internal assessments regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
