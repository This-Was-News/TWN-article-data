## Article summary
Elon Musk has made maximum allowable donations to Republican members of Congress who support impeaching federal judges perceived to be obstructing President Trump's agenda. Musk's contributions, totaling $6,600 each, have gone to seven Republican lawmakers who have endorsed judicial impeachments or taken action against recent court rulings, including a controversial decision by Judge James E. Boasberg. This decision involved the administration's handling of Venezuelan gang members and has raised concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. Musk's support for these lawmakers signals his willingness to back efforts that align with Trump's objectives, particularly regarding judicial actions. 

Notable recipients of Musk's donations include Representatives Eli Crane, Lauren Boebert, and Andy Ogles, as well as Senator Charles E. Grassley. The donations come amid escalating calls from Trump and Musk for judicial impeachments, with Musk characterizing judicial decisions as a form of legal abuse. Grassley, while not calling for Boasberg's impeachment, has expressed concerns about the implications of such judicial rulings. The contributions highlight Musk's influence in Congress and his commitment to supporting lawmakers who align with his and Trump's views. 

The article also notes Musk's history of supporting his own political action committees rather than directly donating to candidates, emphasizing his strategic approach to political contributions.
