## Article summary
Hurricane Katrina exposed and exacerbated long-standing issues in New Orleans' criminal justice system, particularly in the public defender's office. Meghan Garvey, a recent law school graduate at the time, helped locate and represent incarcerated individuals whose records were lost during the storm. The chaos revealed systemic problems, such as part-time public defenders, lack of client information, and inadequate resources. Over the past two decades, significant changes have been made, including full-time staff, better funding, and improved client services. Today, the Orleans Public Defenders office is more robust, but challenges remain, and the focus is on ensuring a fairer and more effective criminal justice system.
