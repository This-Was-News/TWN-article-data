## Article summary
Hollywood filmmaker Carl Erik Rinsch has been charged with defrauding Netflix out of $11 million. Rinsch was working on a sci-fi series titled *Conquest*, which was never completed. Instead of using the funds for production, prosecutors allege he misappropriated the money for personal investments, luxury rentals, and high-end vehicles, including five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari. His charges include wire fraud, money laundering, and unlawful monetary transactions, which could result in decades of imprisonment.

The fraud began after Netflix initially paid Rinsch $44 million for the series, with additional funding requested for completion. Reports suggest that Rinsch's behavior became increasingly erratic during production, leading to complaints from crew members and a divorce filing from his wife. Despite financial losses, Rinsch falsely assured Netflix that the project was progressing well. An arbitrator ruled in Netflix's favor last year, requiring Rinsch to repay $11.8 million. He appeared in court recently, agreeing to post a $100,000 bond, while his attorney stated she had not yet reviewed the prosecution's evidence.
