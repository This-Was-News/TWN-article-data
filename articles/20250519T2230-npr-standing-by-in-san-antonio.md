## Article summary
Qatar has gifted a luxury Boeing 747 to the U.S. government, intended to replace Air Force One for President Trump. The plane is currently at a San Antonio airport, awaiting an extensive overhaul by a defense contractor before it can be used. However, experts suggest that retrofitting the aircraft to meet presidential standards could take several years, raising concerns about national security if shortcuts are taken. The Air Force will take ownership of the plane once the necessary paperwork is finalized. Trump has expressed gratitude for the gift, stating he would not use it after leaving office but hopes to display it in his presidential library.

Criticism has emerged from various quarters, including some Republican lawmakers who prefer a domestically built aircraft. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has proposed a ban on retrofitting foreign planes for presidential use. Trump has defended the acceptance of the gift, arguing that it would save taxpayer money and benefit the country. The timeline for the plane's readiness remains uncertain, potentially leaving Trump without a suitable aircraft during his presidency.
