## Article summary
Russia has intensified its aerial bombardments across Ukraine, resulting in significant casualties, including 30 deaths and 163 injuries in recent attacks. These escalations coincide with President Trump's apparent withdrawal from diplomatic efforts to mediate the conflict, following a recent phone call with President Putin. Analysts suggest that the U.S. is reducing military support for Ukraine, which is perceived by Russia as an opportunity to increase its offensive. Trump has condemned the Russian attacks but has not indicated a willingness to provide military assistance to Ukraine, criticizing President Zelensky instead. The U.S. has not approved new military aid packages since Trump took office, and it remains uncertain whether Ukraine will receive further American weaponry. As Ukraine depletes its interceptor missiles, the threat from Russian bombardments is expected to grow. Former Ukrainian military commander Valery Zaluzhny warned that without significant changes, the conflict will persist, with Russia leveraging its manpower advantage. Recent Russian advances in eastern Ukraine highlight the ongoing struggle for key territories. Military analysts note that while Ukraine has adapted its strategies, the increasing pressure from Russian forces could lead to prolonged and bloody battles.
