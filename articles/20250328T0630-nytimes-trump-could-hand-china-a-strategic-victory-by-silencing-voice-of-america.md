## Article summary
The article discusses the potential implications of the Trump administration's decision to dismantle Voice of America (VOA) and end funding for Radio Free Asia (RFA). It highlights how these U.S. government-run outlets have historically provided crucial information about democracy and human rights to millions of Chinese citizens, many of whom learned English through their broadcasts. The author, Li Yuan, shares personal anecdotes from individuals who relied on VOA during oppressive times in China, illustrating the outlet's role in countering state propaganda and offering a window to the outside world. The dismantling of these agencies is seen as a strategic victory for the Chinese government, which has long criticized their reporting on sensitive topics such as the treatment of Uyghurs and Tibetans. 

The article emphasizes that without independent reporting from VOA and RFA, the Chinese populace may be more susceptible to state propaganda, distorting their understanding of reality. Critics, including former listeners, express disappointment and concern over the U.S. government's retreat from promoting its values globally. The article also notes that the Trump administration's rationale for the closure stems from allegations of bias among VOA reporters, although supporters argue that the outlets provide valuable news that challenges authoritarian narratives. Overall, the author argues that the U.S. is relinquishing a vital tool in its competition with China, which continues to invest heavily in shaping global narratives.
