## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has disrupted the established process for U.S. childhood vaccinations by dismissing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (A.C.I.P.), claiming the need to eliminate conflicts of interest. This committee's recommendations have historically ensured that vaccines are covered by insurance and provided for free through the Vaccines for Children program. Kennedy appointed eight new members, many of whom are skeptical about vaccines, raising concerns about a potential rollback of federal vaccination recommendations. Experts warn that changes could lead to increased out-of-pocket costs for parents, creating a two-tier vaccination system based on financial ability. As measles and whooping cough cases rise, the American Medical Association has called for the reversal of this purge. The new committee could impact herd immunity and complicate access to vaccines, especially for uninsured children. While states typically maintain vaccination mandates, confusion remains about how federal changes will affect local policies. Some scientists are forming alternative groups, like the Vaccine Integrity Project, to provide unbiased vaccine guidance. The upcoming A.C.I.P. meeting raises questions about the preparedness of the new members without previous committee support. Overall, this upheaval poses significant risks to public health and vaccination access in the U.S.
