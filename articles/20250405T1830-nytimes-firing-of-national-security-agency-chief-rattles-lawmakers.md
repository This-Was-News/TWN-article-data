## Article summary
The firing of Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, has caused significant concern among lawmakers. President Trump dismissed Haugh on the advice of conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who accused him of disloyalty. This decision has raised questions about the criteria for national security appointments, with critics like Senator Mitch McConnell expressing alarm over the shift towards appointing individuals skeptical of U.S. alliances. Lawmakers, including Representative Jim Himes, defended Haugh, asserting his competence and warning that the administration's actions could weaken national security. There are fears that the Trump administration may separate the roles of NSA director and Cyber Command head, a move opposed by Himes, who believes it could lead to further inefficiencies. The removal comes at a precarious time, with rising cyber threats from adversaries like China and Russia. Senator Angus King emphasized the danger of losing experienced leaders in the face of ongoing cyberattacks. Overall, the firings have been characterized as part of a troubling trend influenced by questionable sources within the administration.
