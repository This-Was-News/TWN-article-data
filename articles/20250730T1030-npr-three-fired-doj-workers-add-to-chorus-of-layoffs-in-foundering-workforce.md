## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has seen hundreds of employees fired this year, often without clear reasons, creating fear and transforming the workforce. Career civil servants like Ila Dess and Carolyn Fensten have lost their jobs abruptly, with Dess being terminated without explanation and Fensten dismissed due to her husband's app, ICEBlock, which tracks immigration agents. The Trump administration has used Article 2 powers to bypass civil service laws, leading to widespread layoffs. Former DOJ lawyer Erez Reuven, who was fired after revealing a wrongful deportation, has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging political appointees misled courts to expedite deportations. Reuven's actions highlight broader concerns about the DOJ's integrity and the treatment of career civil servants under the current administration.
