## Article summary
Four former housekeepers have accused R&B legend Smokey Robinson of rape and sexual battery in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The complaint alleges that the women, who worked for Robinson and his wife, experienced repeated sexual assaults and harassment, with one housekeeper claiming she was forced to resign due to the misconduct. The allegations span back to at least 2007 and include claims of false imprisonment, emotional distress, gender violence, and illegal working conditions. The plaintiffs are represented by the law firm Harris & Hayden, which is seeking $50 million in damages. During a press conference, attorney John Harris labeled Robinson a "serial assaulter" and indicated that the women felt intimidated by his celebrity status, which prevented them from speaking out sooner. The lawsuit has not yet received a response from Robinson's representatives, and the women have not filed police reports regarding the incidents. Robinson, now 85, is known for his significant contributions to Motown music, including hits like "The Tears of a Clown."
