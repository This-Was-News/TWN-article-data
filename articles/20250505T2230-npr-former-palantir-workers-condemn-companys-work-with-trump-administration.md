## Article summary
Former employees of Palantir, a data-mining and surveillance company, have publicly condemned its collaboration with the Trump administration, arguing it contradicts the company's founding principles. In a letter, 13 ex-workers, including software engineers and privacy experts, expressed concern over a recent deal in which Palantir was paid $30 million by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to monitor migrant movements. They emphasized that when they joined Palantir, they believed in its commitment to democracy and ethical AI development, which they feel has been compromised. The letter highlights the ethical implications of using technology for immigration enforcement and criticizes the company's leadership for promoting violent rhetoric. 

The former workers called for greater resistance among tech employees against what they perceive as the misuse of AI under the current administration, including policies that may infringe on due process rights. They warned of the dangers posed by normalizing authoritarianism in Silicon Valley and urged others in the tech community to speak out against these trends. Despite the small number of signatories relative to Palantir's workforce, their statement is significant given the company's secretive nature and the typical silence of former employees due to non-disparagement agreements. The letter serves as a wake-up call for the tech industry to reconsider its role in shaping societal and governmental policies.
