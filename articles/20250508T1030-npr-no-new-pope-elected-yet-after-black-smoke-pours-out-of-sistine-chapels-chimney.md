## Article summary
Black smoke emerged from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel on May 8, 2025, signaling that the conclave of 133 cardinal electors has yet to elect a new pope. The cardinals have voted three times without reaching the required two-thirds majority. They are scheduled to conduct two additional votes that afternoon, with plans for four votes daily until a candidate is chosen, followed by a day of prayer if needed. The conclave commenced with cardinals entering the chapel to select a successor to the late Pope Francis. 

St. Peter's Square was filled with a diverse crowd, reflecting various ages and languages, as people gathered in anticipation of the smoke signaling the election outcome. Many attendees, including pilgrims and locals, expressed a sense of quiet anticipation. Some, like Texas native Ceci Triska, emphasized the importance of prayer and divine guidance in the selection process. Patrizia Silveri, a Roman local, expressed a desire for an Italian pope, viewing the pope as part of their family. Meanwhile, young Catholic student Mireia Mejias from Spain hopes the new pope will continue the legacy of inclusivity established by Pope Francis.
