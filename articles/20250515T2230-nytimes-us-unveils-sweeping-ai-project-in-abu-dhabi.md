## Article summary
The United States and the United Arab Emirates have entered into a significant agreement aimed at enhancing the U.A.E.'s capabilities in artificial intelligence. This initiative was announced during President Trump's visit to a new A.I. campus in Abu Dhabi, which will be the largest A.I. project outside the U.S., powered by American-made A.I. chips. The campus, developed by Emirati company G42 in collaboration with U.S. firms, will utilize 5 gigawatts of electrical power and span 10 miles. This project builds upon the U.S.-U.A.E. A.I. Acceleration Partnership, reinforcing their collaboration in the A.I. sector. 

The agreement allows the U.A.E. to obtain American A.I. chips, a move that diverges from a previous framework established by the Biden administration, which limited chip sales based on recipient countries. Critics have raised concerns about the reliability of the U.A.E. as a partner, given its authoritarian government and connections to China. There are worries that the technology could inadvertently benefit China, or that major data centers could shift to the Middle East rather than remain in the U.S. 

Despite these concerns, U.S. officials have emphasized the importance of the agreement, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick calling it a historic partnership that advances U.S. A.I. dominance and extends American technology to a strategic ally in the region.
