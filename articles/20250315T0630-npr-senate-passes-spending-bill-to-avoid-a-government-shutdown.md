## Article summary
The Senate has passed a spending bill aimed at preventing a government shutdown, voting 54 to 46 to fund the government through the end of September. The bill, which includes a modest increase in defense spending and cuts to non-defense programs, reflects Republican priorities and has sparked division among Democrats. Notably, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's decision to support the bill led to backlash from House Democrats, who largely opposed it, viewing it as a "blank check" for President Trump. 

Some Senate Democrats expressed concerns that passing the bill would enable further cuts to federal programs without oversight. Despite these concerns, many acknowledged that a shutdown would cause significant harm to constituents. Schumer justified his support by arguing that keeping the government open was preferable to allowing Trump to gain more power through a shutdown. 

The vote has intensified discussions about leadership within the Democratic party, with some members questioning Schumer's strategy. The situation highlights a broader rift in the party regarding how to confront the Trump administration and manage internal divisions.
