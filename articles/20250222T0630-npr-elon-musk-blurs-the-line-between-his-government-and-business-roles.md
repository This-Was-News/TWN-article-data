## Article summary
Elon Musk's dual roles as a tech entrepreneur and a "special government employee" have raised significant concerns about potential conflicts of interest. While Musk claims to be slashing government inefficiencies through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), critics argue that his ongoing business ventures, which often involve federal contracts, blur the lines between his governmental and corporate responsibilities. Both Musk and President Trump assert that they will avoid conflicts of interest, but ethics experts express skepticism, noting the difficulty for the public to verify these claims.

Musk's frequent appearances alongside Trump and world leaders, such as during a recent meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, further complicate perceptions of his role. Critics highlight that Musk's ability to "change hats" as needed raises questions about his commitment to public interests versus personal business gains. The lack of required public disclosures about Musk's activities adds to the opacity surrounding his influence in government.

Despite assurances from the White House that Musk will file financial disclosures, there are concerns about the absence of established protocols to prevent self-dealing. As Musk continues to navigate these roles, the ambiguity surrounding his authority and responsibilities remains a topic of debate among legal and ethics experts. Ultimately, the situation underscores a broader issue of transparency and accountability in government appointments involving private sector leaders.
