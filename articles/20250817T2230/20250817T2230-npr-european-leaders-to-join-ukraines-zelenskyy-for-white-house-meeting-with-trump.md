## Article summary
European and NATO leaders have announced they will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. This move follows Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The European leaders aim to support Zelenskyy and prevent a repeat of a heated encounter that occurred in February. Retired French General Dominique Tranquand noted that the Europeans are concerned about the meeting's outcome and want to show solidarity with Zelenskyy. The presence of these leaders demonstrates Europe's support for Ukraine and could help ease concerns about Ukraine being pressured into a peace deal with Russia. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are among those who will join Zelenskyy. While some leaders have confirmed their participation in the talks, others have not specified if they will be part of the actual meeting with Trump. This collective effort underscores Europe's determination to have a voice in Trump's peace-making efforts, especially after Zelenskyy was not invited to the recent U.S.-Russia summit.
