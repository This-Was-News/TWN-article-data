## Article summary
Dr. Aleu Kamara, Sierra Leone's first and only neurosurgeon, has revolutionized healthcare in the country by performing the first-ever spine surgery on a patient named More Abbu. Kamara's journey to becoming a neurosurgeon was inspired by the lack of medical care for head and spinal injuries in Sierra Leone. After training in China, he returned to Sierra Leone and, with the support of global partners like Mission Brain, established a neurosurgery program. The surgery on Abbu, who was paralyzed and suffocating due to a mass at the base of his skull, was a success, with Abbu showing signs of movement just hours after the operation. The effort to bring neurosurgery to Sierra Leone involved a network of professionals and organizations, including Fatu Conteh, Dr. Kee Park, and Mission Brain. Despite challenges such as limited medical supplies and funding, Kamara and his team are committed to improving healthcare in Sierra Leone, with plans to establish a teaching service and a fund for indigent patients. Kamara's dedication highlights the potential for meaningful change in the country's health sector.
