## Article summary
Washington's hydropower has spurred a data center boom in towns like Quincy, bringing economic benefits such as reduced poverty, new public amenities, and improved schools. However, concerns arise over the long-term sustainability of water and energy resources, as data centers have significant demands. While data centers initially create many construction jobs, they offer fewer long-term positions. Environmental activists worry about the impact on climate goals and the potential for future resource shortages. Despite these concerns, the data center industry continues to expand, with new projects pending and discussions about additional power sources, including natural gas and renewable energy. The boom has also led to new businesses catering to the influx of workers, but there are fears about the industry's long-term viability and the eventual end of the 'gold rush.'
