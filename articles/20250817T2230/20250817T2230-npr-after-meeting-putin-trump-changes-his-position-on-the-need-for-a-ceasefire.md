## Article summary
President Trump initially prioritized a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war during his flight to Alaska for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, after meeting Putin, Trump changed his stance, stating that a ceasefire was not essential and advocating for a permanent peace agreement instead. This shift aligns Trump with Putin's position and puts him at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who supports a ceasefire. Zelenskyy is scheduled to visit the White House, aiming to secure further Western support for Ukraine. Ukraine argues that a ceasefire is necessary to stop immediate fighting and force Russia to negotiate, fearing that without it, Putin will continue the war to gain concessions. Russia, on the other hand, believes a ceasefire could weaken its military momentum. The diplomatic debate now centers on whether to pursue a near-term ceasefire or a comprehensive peace agreement, a topic that will be discussed during Trump and Zelenskyy's meeting.
