## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is set to meet with President Trump, accompanied by European leaders to ensure a viable Ukraine and maintain the trans-Atlantic alliance. Concerns arise as Trump's shifting stance on Ukraine aligns more closely with Putin's interests, potentially undermining European security. European officials aim to prevent Trump from pressuring Zelensky into unfavorable deals. Trump has offered U.S. security assurances for Ukraine post-war, though details remain unclear. European leaders emphasize the importance of security guarantees and a cease-fire, urging talks among the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. Tensions highlight the risk of a divided NATO, with Trump adopting Putin's rhetoric and strategies. The U.S. and European allies now pursue different negotiating strategies, creating opportunities for Putin to exploit divisions. Trump's reversal on requiring a cease-fire before peace talks has raised alarms among European allies, who fear for the cohesion of the Atlantic alliance. European leaders are working to secure concrete security guarantees for Ukraine, including potential peacekeeping efforts, while navigating Trump's unpredictable policies.
