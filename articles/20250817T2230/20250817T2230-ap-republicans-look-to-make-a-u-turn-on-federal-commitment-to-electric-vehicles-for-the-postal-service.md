## Article summary
The U.S. Postal Service's plan to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is facing opposition from Republican lawmakers who seek to revoke federal funding and halt the shift to clean energy. Despite a Senate parliamentary block, efforts continue to stop the fleet's transition, citing cost savings. Critics argue that canceling the program would waste millions already invested. A 2022 University of Michigan study found that electric postal vehicles could cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over 20 years. Many GOP lawmakers, including Sen. Jon Ernst and Rep. Michael Cloud, criticize the EV initiative, calling it a wasteful boondoggle with delays and high costs. The Postal Service maintains that production delays are modest and planned. The agency is in the midst of a $40 billion modernization plan, backed by President Joe Biden, to replace aging gas-powered trucks. The new electric vehicles, designed for greater capacity and safety, have been praised by postal employees. The agency has ordered 51,500 Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, including 35,000 battery-powered ones, and has received some initial deliveries. Despite opposition, proponents argue that postal routes are ideally suited for electric vehicles due to their short distances and frequent stops.
