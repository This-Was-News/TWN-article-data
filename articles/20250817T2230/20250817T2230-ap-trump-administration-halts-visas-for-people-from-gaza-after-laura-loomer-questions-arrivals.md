## Article summary
The Trump administration has halted B-1 and B-2 visitor visas for people from Gaza pending a review, following conservative activist Laura Loomer's social media posts questioning how children from Gaza obtained visas for medical treatment in the U.S. The State Department announced the pause on Saturday, citing concerns raised by congressional offices about potential links between organizations involved in the visa process and terrorist groups like Hamas. Secretary of State Marco Rubio mentioned the pause on Sunday, without providing evidence or naming the organizations. Loomer had posted videos of children from Gaza arriving in San Francisco and Houston for medical treatment, facilitated by an organization called HEAL Palestine. The State Department declined to comment on the number of visas granted or whether Loomer's posts influenced the decision. HEAL Palestine expressed distress over the visa halt, stating it provides urgent medical care to children in Palestine. The World Health Organization has called for more medical evacuations from Gaza, where the health system has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict. The U.N. and partners report severe shortages of medical supplies in Gaza due to Israel's blockade.
