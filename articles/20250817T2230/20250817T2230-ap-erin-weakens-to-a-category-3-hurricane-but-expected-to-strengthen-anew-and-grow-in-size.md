## Article summary
Hurricane Erin weakened to a Category 3 hurricane on Sunday, with its outer bands affecting the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Despite a decrease in maximum winds, the storm grew in size, prompting tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas. The storm is expected to strengthen again and could bring dangerous rip currents and flooding tides along the U.S. East Coast. Bermuda may also experience similar conditions as Erin is forecast to turn north and then northeast. Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, previously reached Category 5 status with winds of 160 mph before weakening. It is expected to remain powerful and grow over the next few days. The storm's center was located northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and east of Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest. Heavy rain and winds caused power outages and flight cancellations in Puerto Rico. Scientists link the rapid intensification of hurricanes to climate change, with warmer ocean temperatures fueling stronger storms.
