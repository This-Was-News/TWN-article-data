## Article summary
European and NATO leaders, including those from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Finland, will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. This gathering aims to present a united front in discussions about ending Russia's war in Ukraine and establishing U.S. security guarantees. The European leaders' support follows Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They seek to ensure a more positive outcome than a previous heated encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy. French President Emmanuel Macron and other leaders have outlined plans to strengthen Ukraine's armed forces with training and equipment. They also propose an allied force in Ukraine to secure peace and deter further Russian invasion. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed support for Trump's willingness to contribute to security guarantees. The substance of these guarantees, rather than their label, is deemed crucial. The meeting includes high-ranking officials from various European countries and NATO, aiming to address Ukraine's security and future. Zelenskyy emphasizes the importance of both U.S. and European involvement in negotiations, highlighting the need for a strong Ukrainian army and international support.
