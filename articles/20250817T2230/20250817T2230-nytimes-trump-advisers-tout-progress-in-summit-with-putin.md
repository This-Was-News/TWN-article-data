## Article summary
The web page discusses various political events and statements related to President Trump's interactions with President Putin and the situation in Ukraine. Senator Chris Murphy criticized the Trump-Putin meeting, calling it a failure and suggesting secondary sanctions against Russia's trading partners. European leaders commended Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees to Ukraine. Former Vice President Mike Pence welcomed Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Washington to combat crime, despite his earlier criticism of Trump's slow response during the January 6 Capitol riots. Trump's advisers, Steve Witkoff and Marco Rubio, provided differing views on the progress made during the summit, with Witkoff suggesting Putin was open to concessions, while Rubio cautioned that both Russia and Ukraine would need to make concessions for a peace agreement. The page also mentions a report about sensitive documents left in a hotel printer in Anchorage, which the Trump administration downplayed as a glorified lunch menu. Additionally, it covers protests in Washington against the National Guard deployment and the announcement of additional troops from Republican-led states to support Trump's initiative to restore order in the capital.
