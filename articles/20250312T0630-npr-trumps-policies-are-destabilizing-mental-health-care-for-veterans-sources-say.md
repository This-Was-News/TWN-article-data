## Article summary
Trump's policies are reportedly destabilizing mental health care for veterans, leading to significant concerns among providers and patients at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The agency, a major mental health care provider, is facing cuts, including a planned reduction of 80,000 jobs, which many fear will negatively impact care quality. Providers express anxiety over changes that target marginalized groups, particularly LGBTQ patients, with new executive orders prompting the removal of supportive symbols in the workplace. This has created a culture of fear among employees, who worry about being reported for non-compliance with these directives.

Patients with PTSD and other mental health issues are experiencing heightened anxiety due to these changes, with some feeling compelled to alter their medical records to avoid discrimination. Advocates warn that eliminating staff may compromise the integrated care model essential for effective treatment, potentially jeopardizing ongoing research initiatives. Despite assurances from VA leadership about preserving critical positions, the future of specialized services remains uncertain. The overall atmosphere within the VA is described as increasingly precarious, likening it to a sinking ship where many are unaware of the impending crisis.
