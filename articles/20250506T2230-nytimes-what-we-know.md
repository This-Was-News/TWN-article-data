## Article summary
India has conducted strikes on Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, primarily Hindu tourists. The Indian government claims the attackers had cross-border links to Pakistan, which denies any involvement. The strikes targeted several locations in Pakistan, including areas previously associated with militant groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. In response, the Pakistani military stated that the attacks would not go unanswered. The April 22 attack in Kashmir was one of the deadliest in decades, prompting a crackdown by Indian security forces.

The Kashmir conflict dates back to the 1947 partition of British India, leading to ongoing tensions between the two nations over territorial claims. Pakistan has historically supported militancy in Kashmir, although it now asserts that groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba are defunct. Experts warn that a military confrontation could escalate quickly due to both countries' nuclear capabilities, with India feeling emboldened by international support. Kashmir remains heavily militarized, with significant unrest and political suppression in both Indian and Pakistani-administered regions. The situation is further complicated by India's revocation of Kashmir's semi-autonomous status in 2019, which has intensified local discontent.
