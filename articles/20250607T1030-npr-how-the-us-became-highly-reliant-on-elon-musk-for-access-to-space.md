## Article summary
The U.S. has become increasingly dependent on SpaceX for essential space operations, particularly amid tensions between Elon Musk and former President Trump. Musk's feud with Trump raises concerns about the stability of federal contracts, with Trump threatening to cut SpaceX's funding. SpaceX has gained prominence due to its innovative reusable rocket technology, which has made it a favored partner for the Pentagon. Currently, SpaceX accounts for 83% of global spacecraft launches and provides critical services like the Starlink satellite network, which is utilized by the military. The ongoing geopolitical situation, including the war in Ukraine, underscores the risks of relying on a single individual for vital technologies. Although SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become NASA's primary transport to the International Space Station, concerns remain about Musk's control over these capabilities. If Musk were to withdraw support, NASA might have to revert to using Russian rockets, which poses additional risks. Future missions, such as the Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon, could face delays if SpaceX's Starship fails to meet its goals. Despite these challenges, experts believe that neither Trump nor Musk could easily act on their threats to terminate contracts, as doing so would face legal obstacles. Overall, the situation reflects the complexities of public-private partnerships in the aerospace sector.
