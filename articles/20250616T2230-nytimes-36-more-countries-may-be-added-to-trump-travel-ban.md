## Article summary
The Trump administration is contemplating expanding its travel ban to include 36 additional countries that fail to address specific security and diplomatic concerns within two months. This potential expansion follows a recent ban on 12 countries and a partial ban on seven others. The countries identified, primarily from Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific region, and Central Asia, must implement corrective measures regarding vetting and screening processes. Concerns include issues related to government competency, passport security, visa overstays, and cooperation in deportations. The State Department aims to uphold national security through its visa processes but has not detailed the specific issues for each country. A country may mitigate concerns by accepting deportees or serving as a safe third country for asylum seekers. The initial travel bans stemmed from Trump's 2015 campaign promise to halt Muslim immigration, evolving into a broader policy targeting low-income and nonwhite countries. After Biden's presidency rescinded these bans in 2021, Trump reinitiated efforts for a new travel ban upon returning to office. The document highlights ongoing tensions between national security measures and immigration policies.
