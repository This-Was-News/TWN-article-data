## Article summary
Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut and commander of the Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. NASA confirmed his death and shared a statement from his family, highlighting his incredible life, leadership in space exploration, and the profound impact he had on them. Lovell's career was marked by numerous firsts, including setting a space endurance record during Gemini 7 and commanding Apollo 8, the first mission to leave Earth's orbit and reach the moon. The Apollo 13 mission, which nearly ended in disaster due to an oxygen tank explosion, showcased his calm leadership and the heroic efforts of the NASA team to bring the crew home safely. Lovell's experiences and the Apollo 13 mission were later depicted in the 1995 film 'Apollo 13,' starring Tom Hanks. Despite the near-disaster costing him the chance to land on the moon, Lovell reflected on the mission as a triumph and a successful failure that demonstrated the power of teamwork and leadership. Throughout his life, Lovell was a proponent of perseverance, having faced setbacks early in his career before achieving his dreams. He also noted the enduring legacy of the U.S. space program in inspiring children to pursue careers in science, technology, and engineering. Lovell's Apollo 8 mission, which took the famous 'Earthrise' photograph, provided a moment of hope and optimism during a turbulent year in the United States. He lamented that NASA did not receive enough funding to continue bold explorations of the universe.
