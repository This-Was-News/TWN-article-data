## Article summary
Robert Francis Prevost, the newly elected pope, has Creole roots tracing back to New Orleans, where his maternal grandparents, Joseph Martinez and Louise Baquié, lived in the Seventh Ward. This revelation, confirmed by his brother, highlights that the pope is not only the first U.S.-born pontiff but also represents a diverse American heritage. Genealogist Jari C. Honora discovered the pope's ancestry, noting that the grandparents were identified as Black or mulatto in historical records. Their marriage certificate and census records provide evidence of their background, with Joseph Martinez listed as a Black cigar maker. 

Creole culture in Louisiana, which includes mixed-race people of color, has a rich history tied to education, business, and the arts, particularly jazz. The announcement of the pope's heritage has been seen as significant for the history of Louisiana Creoles, as many have historically concealed their identities. John Prevost, the pope's brother, stated that their family did not actively discuss their Creole roots. This discovery raises important discussions about racial identity in the U.S. and reflects the complex tapestry of American experiences. The investigation into the pope's background underscores the interconnectedness of American identities.
