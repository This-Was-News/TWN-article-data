## Article summary
President Trump's tariffs on foreign goods are now fully in effect, with the highest import levies since the 1930s. Tariffs on goods from Europe, Japan, Vietnam, and Bangladesh have increased, while additional penalties apply to Chinese goods. Retailers and wholesalers began stockpiling goods last winter to avoid new import taxes, which has delayed the full impact on store prices. Many businesses have absorbed some of the tariff costs to avoid passing them entirely onto consumers. Companies like General Motors and Stellantis have felt significant financial impacts but have largely absorbed these costs. Economists predict that U.S. consumers will eventually pay about $2,400 per household due to higher tariffs. Procter & Gamble plans to raise prices on a quarter of its products by an average of 2.5%. Inflation is slightly heating up, with prices increasing faster in categories affected by tariffs, such as clothes, appliances, and toys. Businesses hope that the original high tariff rates on Chinese goods will not be implemented, as they could severely impact their operations.
