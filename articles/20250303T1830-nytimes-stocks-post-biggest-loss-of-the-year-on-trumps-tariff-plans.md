## Article summary
On March 3, 2025, the stock market experienced its most significant loss of the year, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.8 percent following President Trump's announcement of a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico. This decision heightened investor concerns about potential impacts on corporate profits and inflation. The Nasdaq index fell 2.6 percent, nearing a correction phase, while the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.1 percent, marking a decline of over 14 percent since its peak in late November. Trump's tariff plans also included an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, compounding fears of rising prices and prolonged elevated interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The market had already shown signs of weakness in February, with a 1.4 percent decline attributed to investor unease over the administration's policies and consumer sentiment. The Vix volatility index, a measure of market fear, rose sharply, reflecting growing anxiety among traders. The sell-off was further exacerbated by a weaker-than-expected manufacturing index reading, signaling slower growth in that sector. Overall, the day's events underscored the fragility of market confidence in light of escalating trade tensions.
