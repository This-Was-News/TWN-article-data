## Article summary
NPR's annotated fact check of President Trump's address to Congress provides a detailed analysis of the claims made during his speech. Trump, addressing Congress for the first time in his second term, discussed his administration's actions and future plans regarding various topics including immigration, inflation, energy, and foreign policy. He asserted that illegal border crossings had dropped significantly since his administration took office and emphasized plans for the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. 

Trump criticized the Biden administration for high illegal crossings and linked immigration to crime, despite data showing that increased immigration has contributed to labor force growth. On inflation, he claimed that the previous administration left an economic disaster, citing high grocery prices, particularly for eggs, which have surged due to avian flu. 

He also mentioned his administration’s push for fossil fuel production while ignoring the record levels of oil and gas output achieved under Biden. Trump's remarks on gender and education included a commitment to banning transgender ideology in schools, which critics argue could harm transgender youth. He called for extending tax cuts and balancing the federal budget, despite the growing national debt during his terms. Lastly, he made misleading statements about the U.S. support for Ukraine and the Paris Climate Accord, emphasizing a narrative of fiscal irresponsibility on the part of previous administrations.
