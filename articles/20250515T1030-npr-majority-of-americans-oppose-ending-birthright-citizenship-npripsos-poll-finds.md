## Article summary
A recent NPR/Ipsos poll reveals that a majority of Americans, 53%, oppose ending birthright citizenship, a principle allowing automatic citizenship for children born on U.S. soil. Despite President Trump's push to eliminate this policy, public opinion remains largely unchanged since earlier polls. The survey indicates that while support for some of Trump's hardline immigration policies persists, there are signs of softening among certain demographics, particularly independents. Nearly half of respondents support deporting alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, but opinions on mass deportation are nearly split, with 40% in favor and 42% opposed. The poll highlights a complex public sentiment regarding due process for immigrants, with 45% believing that First Amendment rights should apply to all, regardless of legal status. However, 46% agree with Trump that legal proceedings for undocumented immigrants would be overly lengthy. Respondents express concern over the impact of deportation policies on families and communities, with many feeling that the Trump administration's actions lack compassion. The findings underscore a significant divide in American views on immigration and citizenship rights.
