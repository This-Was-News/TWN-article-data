## Article summary
The U.S. economy has shown resilience amid inflation and high interest rates, but the recent trade war initiated by President Trump could jeopardize the strong job market. Economists warn that the sweeping tariffs will raise prices for consumers and businesses, potentially leading to reduced hiring and layoffs if the situation persists. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies has already caused businesses to delay hiring and investment plans. The labor market, despite its current strength, may be more fragile than it appears, with companies hesitant to add jobs and workers taking longer to find employment. Industries directly impacted by tariffs, such as retail and manufacturing, are likely to feel the effects first, with many companies scaling back hiring plans. Even businesses seemingly unaffected may suffer if consumer spending declines due to higher prices. Layoffs have increased among small businesses, but many employers are still reluctant to cut jobs due to recent labor shortages. The potential for rising unemployment is concerning, with forecasts suggesting it could reach 5 percent. Overall, the combination of tariffs and inflation complicates the hiring landscape, making future job cuts a possibility if conditions do not improve.
