## Article summary
Harvard University and the Trump administration are nearing a settlement that would require Harvard to pay $500 million to regain access to federal funding and end investigations. The agreement aims to resolve a months-long dispute that began with an investigation into campus antisemitism and escalated into a broader conflict. The Trump administration cut over $2.6 billion in research funding and attempted to block Harvard from hosting international students. Harvard sued the administration, alleging illegal retaliation. The proposed $500 million payment would be the largest penalty imposed by the administration on elite universities. Columbia University previously agreed to pay $200 million, and Brown University agreed to pay $50 million. The settlement details are still being finalized, including where Harvard's payment would go. The Trump administration has targeted Ivy League schools, accusing them of promoting liberal ideology. Over a dozen Democratic Congress members who attended Harvard warned against the settlement, fearing it would set a dangerous precedent.
