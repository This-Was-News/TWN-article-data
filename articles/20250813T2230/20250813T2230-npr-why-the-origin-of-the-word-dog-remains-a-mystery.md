## Article summary
The origin of the word 'dog' remains a mystery despite its common usage. Dogs, descended from wolves, have been domesticated for thousands of years and share a close bond with humans. The term 'dog' became standard around 500 years ago, replacing 'hound,' which was derived from Old English 'hund.' Initially, 'dog' was used as an insult but later became a term of affection. Its meaning has evolved over time, describing various things like an ugly woman in the 1930s and a sexually aggressive man in the 1950s. Theories suggest 'dog' may come from Old English 'dox,' meaning a color, or 'dugan,' meaning good or strong. The word's long history and common usage make its origin hard to trace. 'Dog' has also inspired various sayings and idioms, reflecting its deep integration into human language and culture.
