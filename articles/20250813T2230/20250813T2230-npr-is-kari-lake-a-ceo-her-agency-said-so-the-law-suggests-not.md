## Article summary
Kari Lake, a Trump administration advisor, has been referred to as the acting CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and Voice of America (VOA), but her legal eligibility for the position is questionable. Lake has been overseeing the agency despite lacking a clear, documented role, which raises legal concerns about her decisions. Former federal officials and ethics experts argue that Lake does not meet the legal requirements to hold the CEO position, as she has not been officially appointed by the president or confirmed by the Senate. The agency's recent actions, including firing VOA journalists and reducing language services, have sparked legal challenges. Lake's title has shifted multiple times, adding to the confusion about her authority. The Trump administration's justification for her role relies on presidential control of the executive branch, but the legal requirements for the CEO position are not being met. The situation has led to ongoing legal battles and questions about the legitimacy of Lake's actions at VOA and USAGM.
