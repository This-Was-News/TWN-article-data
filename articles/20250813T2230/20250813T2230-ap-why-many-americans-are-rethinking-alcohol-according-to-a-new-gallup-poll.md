## Article summary
A new Gallup poll reveals that fewer Americans are reporting alcohol consumption, with a growing belief that even moderate drinking poses health risks. A record 53% of U.S. adults now consider moderate drinking unhealthy, up from 28% in 2015, driven largely by young adults but also increasingly by older adults. The survey, conducted in July, shows that 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, the lowest rate in three decades. Concerns about health impacts are rising, with even alcohol consumers drinking less. The federal government is updating dietary guidelines, including those around alcohol, as evidence mounts that alcohol consumption leads to negative health outcomes and is a leading cause of cancer. Younger adults are quicker to accept the harms of drinking, but older adults are also increasingly recognizing the risks. The scientific consensus has shifted, with several countries lowering their alcohol consumption recommendations. The U.S. surgeon general recently recommended labeling alcohol bottles to outline the link between consumption and cancer. Current guidelines suggest limiting alcohol intake, with men advised to have no more than two drinks a day and women no more than one. The survey found that while concerns about health risks aren't causing everyone to quit alcohol entirely, they may be influencing how often people drink. Overall, only about one-quarter of Americans who drink reported consuming alcohol in the previous 24 hours, a record low.
