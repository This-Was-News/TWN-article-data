## Article summary
European leaders virtually met with President Trump, urging him to push Russian President Vladimir Putin for a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine before peace talks begin. The Trump-Putin meeting is scheduled for Friday in Alaska, without Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy present. Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Trump agreed Russia must commit to these terms before negotiations. They emphasized the importance of rejecting the legal recognition of Russian-occupied territory. Merz warned that Europe's security and democracy are at risk if Russia's invasion goes unchallenged. He suggested increasing pressure on Russia if no progress is made in Alaska. Trump described the meeting as 'friendly' and expressed optimism for a follow-up summit with Putin and Zelenskyy if Friday's talks go well. However, he acknowledged doubts about stopping Putin from targeting civilians and the difficulty in achieving a quick truce. Putin currently controls nearly 20% of Ukraine and demands Ukraine withdraw from remaining territories and abandon NATO plans, which Kyiv finds unacceptable.
