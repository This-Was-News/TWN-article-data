## Article summary
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnck, overseeing the Census Bureau, acknowledged that Congress, not the president, has final authority over the national census. He suggested differentiating between legal and undocumented residents during the count. Lutnck's remarks come amid Republican efforts to redraw congressional maps using census data before the 2026 midterm elections. Trump has proposed a new census excluding undocumented immigrants, but experts deem it impractical due to the short timeline. Lutnck's comments highlight potential legal hurdles and reference Trump's call to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census. The 14th Amendment mandates counting all persons for apportionment. Lutnck has previously stated he would count every person, but also supports consistency in state counts. Legal experts note that Congress has the authority to direct the census, and current laws allow for a mid-decade census but not for redistributing House seats. Trump's proposal has sparked concerns among census advocates about diverting resources from the 2030 census preparations.
