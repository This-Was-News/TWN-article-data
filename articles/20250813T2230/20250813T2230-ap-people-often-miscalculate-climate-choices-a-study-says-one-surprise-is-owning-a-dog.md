## Article summary
A recent study by the National Academy of Sciences reveals that many Americans struggle to accurately assess which personal decisions most significantly impact climate change. Participants often overestimate the impact of small actions like recycling and underestimate high-impact choices such as avoiding long-haul flights or adopting a dog. The study highlights that actions like avoiding plane flights, not getting a dog, and using renewable electricity are among the most effective but are frequently underestimated. Conversely, low-impact actions like changing to energy-efficient appliances and recycling are often overestimated. Marketing and human psychology contribute to these misconceptions, as visible actions like recycling are more likely to be prioritized over invisible carbon emissions from activities like flying or meat consumption. Dogs, as meat eaters, contribute significantly to climate change due to the methane emissions from farm animals. Experts suggest that better information can help people make more accurate and impactful climate-related decisions. The study found that participants adjusted their choices after being corrected, indicating a willingness to adopt more effective actions once informed. Overall, the findings emphasize the need for clearer communication about the true impact of various lifestyle choices on the environment.
