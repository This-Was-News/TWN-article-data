## Article summary
The White House announced a 24/7 presence of National Guard troops and federal officers in Washington, D.C., starting Wednesday, following President Donald Trump's decision to take over the city's police department for at least a month. The move comes amid Trump's claims of emergency-level crime, despite statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low. Federal agents have been visible in scattered areas, with a significant increase in their presence expected. The administration reported 43 arrests on Tuesday night, though critics downplayed these as routine traffic stops. Various federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, have been patrolling different neighborhoods. Trump hinted at possibly extending his control over the city's police, facing potential resistance from Democratic leaders. The federal effort includes clearing homeless encampments, with the U.S. Park Police removing tents and offering shelter and treatment options. Despite a drop in violent crime, the administration's actions have drawn mixed reactions from city officials and residents, with some expressing concern over the increased law enforcement presence.
