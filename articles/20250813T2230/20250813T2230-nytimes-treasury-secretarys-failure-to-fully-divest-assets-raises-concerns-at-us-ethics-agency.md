## Article summary
The U.S. Office of Government Ethics (O.G.E.) has warned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for failing to divest his financial assets as agreed upon before his confirmation. Bessent, a former hedge fund manager, pledged to divest from various funds, trusts, and farmland investments to avoid conflicts of interest. Despite the requirement to divest within 90 days of confirmation, Bessent has not fully complied, prompting the O.G.E. to notify Senator Michael D. Crapo. Bessent has made partial changes to his ethics agreement but has yet to fully divest, citing the illiquid nature of some assets, particularly farmland in North Dakota. The O.G.E. continues to monitor his compliance and has advised him to avoid any actions that could create conflicts of interest. Bessent has stated that he has divested 90% of the required assets and is working to sell the remaining 4%, which includes farmland. The sale of his farmland could be complicated by the U.S. trade war with China, as a significant portion of North Dakota's soybeans are exported to China. Ethics watchdog groups and Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, with some calling for investigations into Bessent's compliance with ethics laws.
