## Article summary
A record number of U.S. lawmakers are planning to leave Congress ahead of the 2026 midterms, with nine senators and 21 House members announcing they won't seek re-election. This marks a modern record for this point before an election. Notably, several senators, including Tommy Tuberville, Marsha Blackburn, and Michael Bennet, are eyeing gubernatorial runs, a trend not seen in 90 years. The shift is attributed to political polarization and the diminished power of Congress under President Trump. Additionally, the success rate of governors running for Senate is high, with 10 of 14 incumbent or ex-senators winning gubernatorial campaigns in the last 40 years. On the House side, nine representatives, including five Democrats and four Republicans, are aiming for Senate seats. Governors like Brian Kemp and Chris Sununu have opted not to run for Senate, possibly due to the less attractive political climate in Washington. The trend of lawmakers leaving Congress has been driven by retirement, election losses, or pursuing other offices. The August recess often sees an uptick in retirement announcements as lawmakers gauge their re-election prospects.
