## Article summary
A federal appeals court panel ruled 2-to-1 that foreign aid groups cannot challenge President Trump's decision to freeze billions in foreign aid. The decision allows the Trump administration to continue withholding funds approved by Congress, as only the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has the legal right to challenge such actions under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The ruling overturned a lower court's order that required the administration to process foreign aid payments. The funds included nearly $4 billion for global health activities and over $6 billion for H.I.V./AIDS programs. The GAO has found that the Trump administration illegally withheld funds for various programs, but it has not yet sued to force the release of these funds. Foreign aid nonprofits have argued that Trump overstepped his authority, but the appeals court ruled that they lack standing to challenge the president's actions. Judge Karen L. Henderson, writing for the majority, stated that the law outlines a clear process for challenging impoundment, which involves the GAO suing on Congress's behalf. Judge Florence Y. Pan dissented, arguing that courts should scrutinize instances where a president appears to have overruled Congress. The decision is part of a series of appeals court rulings that have overturned lower court efforts to curb Trump's actions. The Trump administration has faced multiple lawsuits over its foreign aid policies, with lower courts previously ruling that the administration violated the separation of powers.
