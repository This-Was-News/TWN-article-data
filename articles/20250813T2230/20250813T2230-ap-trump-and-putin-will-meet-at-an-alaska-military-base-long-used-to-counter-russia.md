## Article summary
President Donald Trump is set to discuss the war in Ukraine with Russian leader Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, a military base historically crucial in countering the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The meeting, scheduled for Friday, takes place at a base that once monitored and deterred Soviet military activity and still plays a role today. The base, formed by merging Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort Richardson in 2010, hosts key aircraft squadrons, including the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jet, and intercepts Russian aircraft entering U.S. airspace. The location provides security and avoids protests, allowing Trump to showcase American military strength while facilitating a productive dialogue. Trump aims to cultivate ties with Putin while signaling military power to gain a bargaining advantage for a potential second meeting. The irony of Putin visiting a base aimed at countering Russian threats comes as Trump seeks a ceasefire deal in the Ukraine war, which he promised to end quickly during his 2024 campaign. Officials from Ukraine and Europe fear the one-on-one meeting could favor Russian goals. French President Emmanuel Macron noted Trump's clear intention to achieve a ceasefire. Trump hinted at possible land swaps and a potential meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin or a meeting with both leaders. Trump expressed optimism for a second, more productive meeting to follow.
