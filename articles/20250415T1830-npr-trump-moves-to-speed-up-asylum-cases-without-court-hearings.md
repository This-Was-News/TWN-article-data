## Article summary
The Trump administration is implementing a new policy to expedite asylum cases in immigration courts, allowing judges to dismiss "legally deficient" cases without holding a hearing. This directive, outlined in an April 11 memo, aims to address the backlog of nearly 4 million pending cases, including 1.5 million asylum requests. Critics argue that this change could lead to unfair outcomes, as judges may decide on asylum eligibility based solely on complex application forms rather than conducting hearings. The policy is part of a broader effort to increase deportations and has drawn comparisons to previous actions taken during Trump's first term, which included limiting asylum approvals and imposing quotas on judges.

Legal experts warn that many asylum seekers lack proper legal representation, which could result in poorly argued cases and increased risks of persecution if they are returned to their home countries. Historically, asylum decisions have relied on comprehensive evaluations, including interviews and evidence submission. The new approach may significantly shorten the timeframe for case resolution but could jeopardize the rights and safety of vulnerable individuals seeking refuge. Asylum claims typically require extensive preparation, often taking hundreds of hours for experienced attorneys, and delays in decision-making have been common, with applicants waiting over four years for outcomes.
