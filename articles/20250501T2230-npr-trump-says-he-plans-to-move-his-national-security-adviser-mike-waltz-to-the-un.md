## Article summary
President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, marking a significant reshuffle in his administration. This move will be the first major change in Trump's second term. Alongside this, Trump plans for Marco Rubio, currently Secretary of State, to serve as the interim national security adviser, a dual role not seen since Henry Kissinger during the Nixon era. Waltz expressed his honor at continuing to serve the president and the nation, although his confirmation by the Senate is required.

The UN ambassador position has been vacant since Trump redirected his first nominee, Elise Stefanik, to remain in Congress. Waltz has faced scrutiny after a recent incident where he accidentally included a journalist in a private chat about military plans. Despite this, Trump has defended him, attributing the mishap to a "glitch." The announcement follows rumors about Waltz's departure, with the last few months described as tumultuous within the administration. Waltz, a former Green Beret and advocate for strong national security policies, has had a complicated relationship with Trump's approach to foreign adversaries.
