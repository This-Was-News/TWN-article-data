## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has canceled nearly $500 million in grants and contracts for developing mRNA vaccines, as announced by the Department of Health and Human Services. This move follows the earlier revocation of a $600 million contract with Moderna for a bird flu vaccine, disappointing scientists who view mRNA vaccines as crucial for pandemic preparedness. Critics, including former BARDA officials, argue that this decision weakens the U.S.'s ability to respond to biological threats and undermines national security. Kennedy has been vocal in his criticism of mRNA technology, making inaccurate claims about its effectiveness against respiratory illnesses. The health department plans to shift focus to older vaccine technologies, such as whole-cell vaccines, despite their known harsh side effects.
