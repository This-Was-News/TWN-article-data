## Article summary
Twenty-one staff members from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have resigned, citing their refusal to assist in dismantling critical public services. In a letter addressed to White House Chief of Staff Susan Wiles, the employees expressed concerns about the risks to Americans' data and public services due to DOGE's initiatives under Elon Musk. The resigning staff, primarily software engineers and product managers formerly with the U.S. Digital Service, noted that they could no longer honor their oath to serve the American people amidst ongoing layoffs and agency dismantling. 

Musk's administration has been criticized for its aggressive approach to reducing government size, which has included significant layoffs and a push to eliminate entire agencies. The resignations follow a chaotic email request from Musk to federal employees, asking them to report their weekly activities, which led to confusion and panic among staff. The departing employees warned that their exit jeopardizes the security of vital government systems that serve millions. 

One of the terminated staff members, Jonathan Kamens, suggested that his dismissal was politically motivated. The letter highlighted growing security risks due to personnel changes and questioned the motivations behind DOGE's efforts. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the resignations in a terse statement.
