## Article summary
President Trump recently made claims about a "genocide" of white farmers in South Africa, presenting a video during a meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa that he asserted showed burial sites of white farmers. The video depicted a road lined with white crosses, which Trump misidentified as graves. However, Nathan Rafferty, whose parents were murdered on their farm in 2020, clarified that the crosses were erected as a memorial and not as markers for graves. Rafferty expressed shock at the use of the video in such a context, stating it reopened painful memories. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the video's implications, suggesting it represented victims of racial persecution. South African officials noted that while crime rates are a significant issue, the narrative around farm murders is often misrepresented. Recent crime statistics revealed that out of six farm-related murders in early 2025, only one victim was white. Police Minister Senzo Mchunu emphasized that the history of farm murders includes many African victims and criticized the distortion of facts to support a misleading narrative.
