## Article summary
European leaders are facing urgent challenges as President Trump’s recent confrontational stance towards Ukraine raises concerns about U.S. support. Following a tense meeting where Trump criticized Ukrainian President Zelensky, European officials are compelled to reassess their defense strategies and increase military spending to reduce reliance on the U.S. The shift in U.S. foreign policy, perceived as favoring Russia, has alarmed leaders who fear that a weak peace deal could embolden Russian aggression across Europe. 

As a response, discussions among European nations are intensifying regarding how to ensure Ukraine's security and what terms they might accept in future aid packages. Upcoming meetings in London and Brussels aim to solidify plans for enhancing European defenses and defining security guarantees for Ukraine. Despite the urgency, building a robust European military capability will take time and financial commitment, which is complicated by existing budgetary constraints. 

European leaders are also grappling with differing opinions on how best to support Ukraine, with Hungary expressing reluctance towards new aid packages. The recent exchanges have fostered a sense of unity among many European nations, prompting calls for immediate action and a reevaluation of defense spending priorities. The situation emphasizes the need for Europe to step up its role in global security as it navigates a more unpredictable relationship with the United States.
