## Article summary
The article discusses Donald Trump's promises to achieve peace in Ukraine within a day, which remain unfulfilled over four months after his second-term inauguration. Despite Russia's proposal for peace talks, both Ukraine and Russia remain entrenched in their positions, particularly regarding territorial disputes. Trump has shown frustration with the slow progress and has suggested that he might "just back away" from negotiations if no advancement occurs. Experts caution that a U.S. withdrawal from negotiations could shift the balance of power in favor of Russia. 

The article outlines Trump's early attempts to engage both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, including a notable Oval Office meeting where Trump criticized Zelenskyy for not being ready for peace. Tensions escalated with the U.S. suspending critical aid to Ukraine and both sides accusing each other of violating ceasefires. 

In recent developments, direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials took place in Istanbul, resulting in a prisoner exchange but little substantial progress. Despite these diplomatic efforts, fighting continues, exacerbated by recent Russian missile strikes on Ukraine. Trump expressed dismay at these actions, indicating his desire for a ceasefire while acknowledging the challenges ahead, including potential concessions from Ukraine that Zelenskyy has thus far rejected.
