## Article summary
The article discusses how current tax cuts may lead to rising tax rates in the future, urging taxpayers to adopt a strategy of diversification to mitigate risks. Investors face uncertainty regarding both their income and the evolving tax code, particularly in light of potential budget deficits stemming from recent tax policies. The article emphasizes that while there is a lack of immediate appetite for tax increases, financial markets may eventually necessitate higher taxes due to increasing deficits. To navigate this uncertainty, taxpayers are encouraged to diversify their tax risk by utilizing various tax shelters, such as traditional and Roth accounts in 401(k)s and IRAs. The author suggests that individuals should consider contributing to both account types based on their changing income levels. Additionally, education accounts (529s) and health savings accounts (HSAs) are highlighted as flexible tax-sheltered investment vehicles. The article points out that diversifying tax strategies can provide more options and potentially limit tax liabilities in the future. Overall, the piece advocates for proactive tax planning in an unpredictable fiscal environment.
