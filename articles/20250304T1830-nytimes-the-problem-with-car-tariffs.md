## Article summary
The article discusses the complexities surrounding car tariffs and the definition of imports in the context of U.S. automotive manufacturing. It highlights how supply chains span across U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico, complicating the classification of vehicles as American-made or imported. President Trump's proposed 25% tariffs on goods from these countries could significantly impact automakers and consumers due to the intricate nature of vehicle assembly and parts sourcing. 

For instance, the Chevrolet Blazer is assembled in Mexico but incorporates parts from the U.S., while the Nissan Rogue, produced in Tennessee, relies heavily on components from Japan and Mexico. The article notes that a vehicle is deemed an import if it undergoes final assembly outside the U.S., despite the origin of its parts. 

Automakers express concern over the potential tariffs, with industry leaders indicating that such measures could severely disrupt the U.S. automotive sector. Despite these complexities, many consumers remain indifferent about the origin of their vehicles, focusing instead on the overall quality and performance. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for clarity in tariff application as the automotive industry navigates these challenges.
