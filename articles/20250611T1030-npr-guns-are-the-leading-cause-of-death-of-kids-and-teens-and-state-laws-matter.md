## Article summary
Gun deaths among children and teens have risen significantly, with state laws playing a crucial role in this trend. A study published in *JAMA Pediatrics* found that states with permissive gun laws saw a substantial increase in pediatric firearm deaths from 2011 to 2023, while those with stricter regulations did not experience such a rise. Dr. Maya Haasz emphasized the potential for policy changes to enhance safety, advocating for a careful examination of effective laws. Following the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in *McDonald vs. Chicago*, many states altered their gun laws, leading to a mix of more lenient and stricter regulations. The study revealed over 6,000 excess deaths in states with the most permissive laws compared to previous years, highlighting a 67% increase in pediatric fatalities. Research suggests that child access prevention laws can effectively reduce gun-related injuries and deaths. The next steps involve identifying specific laws that can help mitigate these fatalities. Dr. Chethan Sathya pointed out the importance of understanding what works in states with lower death rates. Overall, the findings underscore the need for targeted research into gun laws to prevent not only fatalities but also non-fatal injuries among children and teens.
