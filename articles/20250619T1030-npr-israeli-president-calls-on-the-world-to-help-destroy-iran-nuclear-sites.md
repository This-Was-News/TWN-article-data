## Article summary
Israeli President Isaac Herzog has urged the international community to assist in dismantling Iran's nuclear program, which Israel claims is on the verge of producing atomic weapons. Speaking with NPR, Herzog emphasized that while Israel has not formally requested U.S. military involvement, it would welcome support from other nations. The discussion occurred amidst ongoing missile strikes from Iran against Israel. Herzog criticized Iran's nuclear ambitions, calling for an end to its rogue actions. He revealed that Israel had shared intelligence with the U.S. regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities prior to launching its attacks, marking the first public acknowledgment of such cooperation. Although Israel has established air superiority over Iranian territories, the Fordo nuclear site remains particularly challenging to target. Herzog suggested that the conflict could potentially weaken the Iranian regime, possibly leading to its collapse and altering the regional landscape. However, some analysts caution that U.S. intervention might escalate the situation, provoking Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the Gulf and disrupting global markets.
