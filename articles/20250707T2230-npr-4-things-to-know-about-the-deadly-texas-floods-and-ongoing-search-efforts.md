## Article summary
The recent catastrophic flooding in central Texas has resulted in at least 89 confirmed deaths, with ongoing search and rescue efforts underway. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, affecting low-lying areas and leading to significant destruction, including the loss of Camp Mystic, an all-girls' summer camp. Governor Greg Abbott has committed to locating all missing individuals, particularly campers and counselors, as the death toll is expected to increase. Search efforts are complicated by difficult terrain, debris, and adverse weather conditions, with over 850 rescues reported so far. Questions have emerged regarding the adequacy of emergency warnings and preparedness in a region known for flash floods. While some officials blame the National Weather Service for insufficient alerts, the NWS maintains it issued timely warnings. President Trump plans to visit Texas to offer support, and there has been a surge in donations and volunteer efforts from around the world. Local officials are assessing the response to improve future preparedness as the community begins its long recovery process.
