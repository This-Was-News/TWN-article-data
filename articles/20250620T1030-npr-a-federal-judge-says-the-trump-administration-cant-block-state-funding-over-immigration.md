## Article summary
A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a preliminary injunction, stating that significant harm would result without it. The ruling came after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy tied grant disbursements to adherence to immigration enforcement conditions. Twenty Democratic state attorneys general challenged this policy, arguing it was coercive and unrelated to the intended purposes of the funding. Judge McConnell supported the states' position, noting no connection between ICE enforcement and transportation funding. He emphasized that a lack of funding could disrupt vital transportation services and projects, affecting public health and safety. The ruling comes ahead of a grant application deadline, highlighting the urgency of the situation. The Department of Transportation did not comment on the ruling immediately. Overall, the decision underscores the legal limits on federal authority regarding state funding and immigration policy.
