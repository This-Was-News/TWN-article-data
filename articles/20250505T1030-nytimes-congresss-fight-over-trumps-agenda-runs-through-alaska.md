## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of Congress's internal disputes over President Trump's agenda on clean energy initiatives in Alaska, particularly in the village of Noatak. Residents face exorbitant energy costs, with electricity bills four times higher than the national average, primarily due to the reliance on diesel transported by plane. In response, the community has sought to invest in solar energy, especially after the Inflation Reduction Act provided tax credits for clean energy projects. However, uncertainty surrounding the future of these tax credits, as some Republicans push for their elimination, jeopardizes local projects and financial stability. Senator Lisa Murkowski advocates for the preservation of these credits, emphasizing their importance for rural Alaskan communities that lack access to natural gas pipelines. The article highlights the struggles of residents like Bessie Monroe, who face difficult choices between heating and other essential expenses. As energy costs soar, the potential for rolling blackouts looms due to natural gas supply shortfalls. The situation illustrates the broader implications of political decisions on everyday life in isolated communities. Overall, the article underscores the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions to alleviate the financial burden on Alaskan villagers.
