## Article summary
The Justice Department is investigating George Mason University's faculty for their resolution supporting the university's diversity programs and President Gregory Washington, the university's first Black president. The investigation seeks drafts of the resolution, communications among faculty members, and correspondence with the president's office. Free speech advocates criticize the move as an attack on academic freedom, noting that faculty senate resolutions typically have no force and attract little notice. The Trump administration has accused George Mason of antisemitism and discriminatory hiring practices, with similar actions leading to the resignation of the University of Virginia's president and the non-renewal of the Virginia Military Institute's first Black superintendent. Faculty members express concern that the investigations could jeopardize President Washington's job, with the university's Board of Visitors, appointed by Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, set to review his performance.
