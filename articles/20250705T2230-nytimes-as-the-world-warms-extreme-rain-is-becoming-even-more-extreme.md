## Article summary
As global temperatures rise due to fossil fuel consumption, extreme rainfall events are becoming increasingly frequent and intense, leading to catastrophic flooding, such as the recent incidents in Texas. Scientists note that warmer air holds more moisture, resulting in larger downpours when storms occur. Texas, known for its varied weather extremes, faced devastating flooding when humid air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific collided with cooler air, causing severe storms. Data indicates that the likelihood of such extreme rainfall events has dramatically increased, with the Guadalupe River experiencing a rapid rise from three to 34 feet in just 90 minutes. The eastern part of Texas has seen a 20 percent increase in days with significant precipitation since 1900, and projections suggest a further 10 percent increase in extreme rain intensity by 2036. Communities rely on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for planning and infrastructure design related to flooding. NOAA is set to update its precipitation estimates to include climate change projections, aiding future planning efforts. However, recent budget cuts and staff reductions under the Trump administration threaten NOAA's ability to provide essential climate data and assessments. These developments underscore the urgent need for effective climate adaptation strategies in light of increasing weather extremes.
