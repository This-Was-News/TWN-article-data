## Article summary
The turnover rate among U.S. election officials has reached its highest level in decades, with nearly 41% of those who administered the 2020 election leaving their jobs before the 2024 cycle. This trend, particularly pronounced in large jurisdictions, is attributed to increased pressure, harassment, and burnout following the 2020 election and the spread of misinformation. Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center and UCLA highlights a steady increase in turnover rates over the past two decades, with a significant spike after 2020. Factors contributing to this trend include chronic underfunding of elections, budget cuts, and an ongoing information war about election processes. Despite these challenges, the 2024 election was widely considered a success, with high voter confidence. Election officials have responded by improving recruitment and training programs to ensure continuity and competence. The researchers noted that many replacements have prior experience in elections or government, suggesting a resilient election workforce.
