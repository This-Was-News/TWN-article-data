## Article summary
President Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on crime policy, particularly in Washington, D.C., blaming local Democratic leadership for public safety issues. He has criticized Democratic-led cities for what he calls 'radical left' criminal justice policies and has taken extraordinary steps such as nationalizing the D.C. police force. Democrats argue that crime rates have fallen nationwide, but Republicans have successfully framed themselves as the party of 'law and order.' Democrats struggle to counter this narrative, with some blaming the 'defund the police' movement for creating a perception of weakness on crime. Despite Trump's focus on cashless bail, experts note a lack of data supporting this claim. Democrats face challenges in communicating their holistic approach to criminal justice, which includes addressing income inequality and drug addiction. Polls show that many Americans view crime as a serious problem and trust Trump more than Democrats on crime and safety issues. Former officials like Bill de Blasio acknowledge the difficulty in countering Republican messaging, even when crime rates have dropped. Democrats are urged to adopt more centrist stances and improve their messaging on crime to regain voter trust.
