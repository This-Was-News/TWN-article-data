## Article summary
Former President Donald Trump has broadened his criticism of the Smithsonian Institution to include other museums across the country, labeling them as 'woke' in a recent social media post. He expressed dissatisfaction with the Smithsonian, calling it 'OUT OF CONTROL' and hinting at similar scrutiny for other museums. The White House announced plans to audit eight Smithsonian museums to ensure alignment with Trump's directives to celebrate American exceptionalism and remove divisive narratives. Trump's post on Truth Social accused the Smithsonian of focusing on negative aspects of American history, such as slavery, rather than success and brightness. He instructed his attorneys to review museums, similar to actions taken with colleges and universities. Museum and historical associations, including the Organization of American Historians and the American Association for State and Local History, have opposed what they describe as growing threats of censorship against U.S. museums. The American Alliance of Museums emphasized the importance of freedom of thought and expression in museums, which are foundational American values. The White House did not respond to inquiries about the potential chilling effect of governmental reviews on museums' free speech rights and their ability to engage openly with the public.
