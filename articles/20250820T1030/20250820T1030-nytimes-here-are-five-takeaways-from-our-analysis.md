## Article summary
A New York Times analysis of voter registration data reveals a significant decline in Democratic Party registration across the U.S. between 2020 and 2024. The Democratic share of the electorate decreased in all 30 states and Washington, D.C., where voters can register with a political party, while Republicans either expanded their advantage or closed the gap. Key findings include Democrats losing ground with new voters, with their share dropping from 63% in 2018 to less than 48% in 2024. Battleground states like Florida and New Hampshire have seen Democrats lose their long-held registration edges, with Republicans now outnumbering them. The gender gap is widening, with Republican strength among men surpassing the Democratic edge among women. Younger voters, who make up 65% of new registrations, are increasingly opting for the G.O.P., with Republicans becoming a majority among new registrants under 45 in 2024. Despite hopes of a reversal post-Trump's return to the White House, Democratic registrations continue to decline, with 160,000 fewer registered Democrats and 200,000 more Republicans since Election Day 2024. The trend remains bleak for Democrats, even excluding data from New York and New Jersey, where recent primaries may have boosted registrations.
