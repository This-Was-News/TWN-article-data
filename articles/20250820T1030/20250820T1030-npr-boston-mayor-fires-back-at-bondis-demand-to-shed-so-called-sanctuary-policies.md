## Article summary
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu strongly rejected U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's demands to expand police cooperation with immigration enforcement, calling the Trump administration's actions 'false and continuous attacks' on cities and residents. Wu emphasized that Boston follows local, state, and federal laws and will not participate in mass deportations. During a press conference, she defended Boston's Trust Act, which limits police involvement in civil immigration enforcement, and highlighted the city's safety record. Wu criticized the administration's threats of legal action and financial sanctions, stating that Boston will not comply. She was joined by supporters, including U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, who condemned the federal government's actions. Wu also addressed ICE's lack of transparency and Boston's preparedness to defend its rights. Community members, including a 12-year-old U.S. citizen, shared personal stories of the impact of immigration policies. Wu's challenger, Josh Kraft, also opposed the administration's deportation plans. The event underscored Boston's commitment to protecting its immigrant community.
