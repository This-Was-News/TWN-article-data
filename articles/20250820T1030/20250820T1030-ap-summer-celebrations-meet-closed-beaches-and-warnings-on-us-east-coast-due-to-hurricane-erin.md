## Article summary
Hurricane Erin disrupted summer activities along the U.S. East Coast, causing beach closures and dangerous rip currents from Florida to New England. The storm's outer edges brought high winds, large swells, and life-threatening rip currents, with the biggest swells expected as early as Wednesday. New York and New Jersey closed beaches, while Delaware restricted ocean access. Nantucket Island faced waves over 10 feet, and North Carolina's Outer Banks, particularly vulnerable to storm surges, saw mandatory evacuations. Erin, a Category 2 hurricane with winds around 100 mph, was 495 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras. Residents prepared for potential flooding and road closures, with memories of Hurricane Dorian's devastation in 2019 still fresh. Climate scientists note that Atlantic hurricanes are increasingly likely to rapidly intensify due to warmer oceans, as seen with Hurricane Lee two years ago. The Outer Banks, already vulnerable to erosion, faced risks of washed-out roads and damaged homes.
