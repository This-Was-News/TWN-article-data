## Article summary
President Trump has recently held high-stakes summits with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky, along with other European leaders, aiming to end the war in Ukraine. However, the detailed diplomatic work that typically follows such meetings is now underway, with significant gaps and uncertainties emerging. Key issues include whether Russia would accept U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and whether Putin is serious about meeting with Zelensky. Trump's approach has deviated from traditional diplomatic norms, leading to concerns about the lack of preparation and the potential for rushed agreements. Despite Trump's claims of progress, Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine, and there is no clear path to a cease-fire. The Trump administration's statements sometimes contradict information from Russia, adding to the complexity. Trump has ruled out deploying U.S. troops to Ukraine but is open to providing air support for European troops. Foreign policy experts have criticized Trump's shifting stances and lack of a cohesive strategy, describing the diplomatic process as chaotic. Trump acknowledges the difficulty of the situation but hopes for a positive outcome.
