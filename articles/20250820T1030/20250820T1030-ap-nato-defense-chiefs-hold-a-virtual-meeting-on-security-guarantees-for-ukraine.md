## Article summary
NATO defense chiefs held a virtual meeting to discuss potential security guarantees for Ukraine, aiming to support a future peace agreement. Italian Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of NATO's Military Committee, announced the video conference involving 32 defense chiefs. U.S. General Alexus Grynkewicz, NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, participated in the talks. U.S. President Donald Trump has been mediating between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but recent meetings yielded no concrete progress. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for strong security guarantees to prevent future Russian invasions, following overnight missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian regions. European allies are planning a security force to backstop any peace agreement, with 30 countries, including European nations, Japan, and Australia, supporting the initiative. The role of the U.S. in this force remains unclear, as Trump ruled out sending American troops to defend Ukraine. Russia has opposed the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine. Zelenskyy called for increased pressure on Moscow through new sanctions and tariffs. Trump mentioned arrangements for a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, though the Kremlin has not confirmed this. French President Emmanuel Macron suggested Geneva as a possible venue, but Putin's travel is limited due to an International Criminal Court warrant for his arrest.
