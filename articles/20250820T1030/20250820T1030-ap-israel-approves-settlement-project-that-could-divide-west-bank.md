## Article summary
Israel has approved a controversial settlement project in the occupied West Bank, which could effectively divide the territory in two. The project, located in E1 east of Jerusalem, includes plans for around 3,500 apartments to expand the settlement of Maale Adumim. This development has been under consideration for over two decades but was previously frozen due to U.S. pressure. The approval was finalized after the last petitions against it were rejected. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich framed the approval as a response to Western countries planning to recognize a Palestinian state, stating that it buries the idea of a Palestinian state. The E1 location is significant as it is one of the last geographical links between Ramallah and Bethlehem, crucial for a future Palestinian state. Peace Now, an organization tracking settlement expansion, warns that the project is deadly for any chance of a peaceful two-state solution. Israel's settlement plans are part of a challenging reality for Palestinians in the West Bank, amid increasing attacks and restrictions. Over 700,000 Israelis now live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas sought by Palestinians for a future state. The international community largely considers these settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel's government, dominated by religious and ultranationalist politicians, has granted Smotrich authority over settlement policies, with plans to double the settler population in the West Bank.
