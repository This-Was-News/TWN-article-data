## Article summary
Hurricane Erin is approaching the U.S. East Coast, bringing dangerous rip currents and flooding risks. As of Tuesday, it was 615 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, moving north-northwest at 10 mph with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph. Although it is not expected to make landfall, the storm will push large waves of 15 to 20 feet or higher onto the shoreline, along with storm surge. Tropical storm warnings and storm surge warnings are in effect for the Outer Banks, with mandatory evacuations ordered for Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands. Forecasters warn of life-threatening inundation and road closures due to flooding. The storm's massive size, rather than its wind speeds, poses the greatest threat, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 230 miles from its center. Experts note that the storm's size is linked to higher storm surge levels and more dramatic impacts, particularly in vulnerable areas like the Outer Banks. Hurricane Erin is the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, and experts caution that climate change is making hurricanes more intense, even if fewer in number.
