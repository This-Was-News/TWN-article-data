## Article summary
Residents of Montmartre, Paris, are fighting against overtourism, which has transformed their neighborhood into a crowded, tourist-dominated area. Local shops and the friendly atmosphere are disappearing, replaced by tourist trinkets, selfie-takers, and cafes spilling into the streets. Olver Baron, a resident, has put his apartment up for sale due to the challenges posed by pedestrian-only streets and the influx of visitors. The Basilica of Sacré-Cœur attracts up to 11 million people annually, overwhelming daily life in Montmartre. Residents protest the 'Disneyfication' of their neighborhood, with banners expressing their frustration. Similar tensions exist at the Louvre Museum, where staff struck over overcrowding and deteriorating conditions. Paris welcomed 48.7 million tourists in 2024, straining local infrastructure. European cities like Barcelona, Venice, and Athens are also implementing measures to manage overtourism, such as entry fees and visitor caps. Urban planners warn of historic neighborhoods becoming 'zombie cities' with displaced residents. Paris is trying to mitigate the issue by cracking down on short-term rentals, but the growing global tourism pressure poses significant challenges for residents.
