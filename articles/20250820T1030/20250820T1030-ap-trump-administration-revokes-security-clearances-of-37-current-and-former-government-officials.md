## Article summary
The Trump administration announced the revocation of security clearances for 37 current and former national security officials, citing accusations of politicizing intelligence and failing to safeguard classified information. The memo by Director of National Intelligence Tuls Gabbard did not provide evidence to support these claims. Many of the targeted officials had left the government years ago, with some involved in matters that angered Trump, such as the intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The move is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to target perceived adversaries and reflects the president's distrust of career intelligence officials. Critics argue that revoking clearances stifles dissenting voices within the intelligence community. Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer whose clearance was also revoked, called the actions unlawful and hypocritical. Gabbard defended the move, stating that security clearances are a privilege, not a right. The revocations come amid efforts to revisit the intelligence community's assessment on Russian election interference, despite multiple government investigations confirming it. Security clearances are crucial for both current and former government workers, impacting their ability to work in the private sector. Trump has previously revoked clearances of other officials, including former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, though some actions were blocked by federal judges. Some of the latest targets were part of Biden's national security team and learned of the revocation through news reports.
