## Article summary
As of May 1, 2025, small-ticket items imported from China to the U.S. will no longer be exempt from tariffs due to President Trump's decision to close the de minimis loophole. This change is expected to significantly increase prices for American consumers who have relied on affordable goods from China, affecting independent online vendors who depend on these imports. The move aims to address concerns about the loophole's connection to the fentanyl trade. Retailers and small businesses, like Kelly Kendall's craft supplies company, are worried about rising costs and the potential need to increase prices for their products. The new tariffs will vary based on shipping methods, with express carriers facing rates as high as 145%. Canadian sellers are also feeling the impact, as the changes have led to confusion and unexpected costs for their U.S. customers. Many small businesses are scrambling to adapt, with some, like Émile Arsalane, halting sales of Chinese-made goods altogether. This shift poses a significant threat to their operations, as tariffs disproportionately affect smaller sellers compared to larger companies. Overall, the closure of the loophole is anticipated to create chaos in the shipping and import sectors, with businesses struggling to navigate the new regulations.
