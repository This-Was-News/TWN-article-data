A mother, referred to as Dana, shares her son Elliott's harrowing experience with predatory online networks that target minors. Elliott, 14, became influenced by these networks, leading to severe self-harm and dangerous ideologies. Dana initially set up parental controls but found Elliott bypassing them. He was drawn to online forums related to his musical interests, where predators manipulated him. These networks, like 764 and CVLT, have been linked to violent acts, including school shootings and suicides. Dana discovered Elliott's extensive self-harm and disturbing online activity after he was hospitalized. The FBI has warned about these networks, which promote nihilistic violent extremism. Experts highlight the manipulative tactics used to exploit vulnerable individuals, often leading them to harm themselves or others. Dana's story underscores the urgent need for awareness and intervention to protect children from these dangerous online influences. Despite the challenges, Elliott has made progress with intensive therapy and support.
