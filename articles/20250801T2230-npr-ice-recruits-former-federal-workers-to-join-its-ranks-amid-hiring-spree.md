## Article summary
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is actively recruiting retired federal workers to join its enforcement, legal, and investigative units as part of a broader hiring initiative. The agency is offering a $50,000 signing bonus and a "dual compensation waiver" that allows retirees to collect their new ICE salary while retaining existing federal benefits, including pension payments. This recruitment drive comes as the Trump administration aims to hire 10,000 people for immigration enforcement, supported by new congressional funds totaling $76.5 billion, with $30 billion specifically allocated for hiring. ICE has extended over 1,000 tentative job offers since July 4, including bringing back officers and agents who retired under the previous administration. Despite these efforts, the agency faces challenges in scaling up deportations, with limited enforcement resources and a significant backlog of nearly 4 million cases in immigration courts.
