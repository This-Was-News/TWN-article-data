## Article summary
Nvidia has become the first public company to reach a $4 trillion valuation, driven by its dominance in providing AI chips and the rapid growth of the AI industry. The company's stock surged to over $164 per share, surpassing tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's success is attributed to its early investment in AI technology and its control over 80% of the market for AI chips, with major tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon heavily investing in its products. The company's market value has skyrocketed from $330 billion in late 2022 to $4 trillion, with CEO Jensen Huang becoming one of the world's richest men. However, Nvidia faces challenges such as competition from other tech companies developing their own AI chips, regulatory scrutiny, and geopolitical risks, which could impact its future dominance in the AI market.
