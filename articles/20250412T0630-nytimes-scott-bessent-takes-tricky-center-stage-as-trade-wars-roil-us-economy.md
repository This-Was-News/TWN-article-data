## Article summary
The gathering of former Treasury secretaries to welcome Scott Bessent into his new role was marked by a serious tone, reflecting the turmoil in the U.S. economy due to President Trump's aggressive tariff policies. Bessent, who was expected to bring moderation to these policies, found himself defending the administration's stance amidst criticism from his predecessors. The dinner attendees, including notable figures like Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, expressed concerns about the potential economic repercussions of the trade war with China, which many economists fear could lead to inflation and a recession. Despite having previously expressed skepticism about tariffs, Bessent has publicly aligned himself with the administration's pro-tariff position, arguing that they will not be inflationary. His comments, which downplayed the impact of market fluctuations on Americans' retirement savings, drew criticism and concern from both investors and political figures. While Bessent has managed to temper some of Trump's tariff strategies, the deepening conflict with China continues to create volatility. Ultimately, the decision-making power regarding tariffs rests with Trump, leaving Bessent in a challenging position. Former Treasury secretaries offered their support and historical insights during the dinner, emphasizing the complexity of Bessent's role amid conflicting interests. The event underscored the serious implications of the current trade policies for the U.S. economy and the difficulties Bessent faces in navigating them.
