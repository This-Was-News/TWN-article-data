## Article summary
President Trump is hosting a dinner at his Trump National Golf Club for 220 top investors in his $TRUMP meme coin, raising ethical concerns regarding the intersection of cryptocurrency and presidential ethics. Launched just before his inauguration, the $TRUMP coin reached a market cap of $27 billion but has seen significant volatility since. Critics argue that the dinner exemplifies potential violations of the Emoluments Clause, suggesting that foreign entities may exploit the situation for political favors. Prominent attendees include cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun, who has faced legal issues with the SEC, and other crypto investors seeking influence. While some view the dinner as merely a networking opportunity, Republican lawmakers have expressed unease about the implications of monetizing access to the presidency. Norm Eisen, a former ethics advisor, warns that such actions could lead to national security risks and foreign interference in U.S. politics. The White House maintains that the president acts in the best interests of Americans, distancing the administration from the meme coin. Critics fear that if unchecked, this could set a precedent for future administrations, effectively commodifying the presidency.
