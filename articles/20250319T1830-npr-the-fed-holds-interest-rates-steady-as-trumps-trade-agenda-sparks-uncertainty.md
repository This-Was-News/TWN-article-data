## Article summary
The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates between 4.25% and 4.5%, citing uncertainty in the economic outlook influenced by President Trump's trade policies, particularly tariffs. While inflation has eased, it remains above the Fed's desired levels, and there are indications that businesses may raise prices due to the tariffs imposed. Trump's recent tariffs include a 20% tax on imports from China and 25% on steel and aluminum, which have contributed to market volatility and uncertainty regarding future economic conditions. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted the difficulty in predicting the long-term effects of these tariffs on the economy and emphasized the importance of waiting for clearer signals before making further adjustments to monetary policy.

Despite the uncertainty, the overall economy remains strong with a low unemployment rate of 4.1% and an annual inflation rate slowing to 2.8%. However, consumer spending has softened, which could lead to slower economic growth and increased pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. The Fed's projections for economic growth have been downgraded from 2.1% to 1.7%, with a slight increase in expected unemployment. Powell highlighted that the Fed is closely monitoring the impacts of tariffs and will adjust its policies based on the evolving economic landscape.
