## Article summary
Chinese President Xi Jinping capitalized on a favorable moment this weekend as leaders of India and Russia joined him at a security summit in China. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the summit, which was followed by a military parade in Beijing showcasing China's newest missiles and warplanes. The event highlighted Xi's efforts to reshape the global order dominated by the United States. The summit of more than 20 leaders, mostly from Central Asia, and the military parade demonstrated China's growing influence. Xi has been successful in turning America's alienation of India into an opportunity and validating his long alignment with Putin. The summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Tajikistan and the military parade in Beijing commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II were significant events. Xi has sought to recast World War II as a struggle where China and the Soviet Union were the decisive theaters of battle, shifting claims of victory towards China and Russia. The military parades are part of an ongoing memory war, offering an alternative history to the Western narrative of the Allied victory. Xi's foreign policy strategy has been reflected in the parade of leaders traveling to China, with analysts noting that Xi feels more besieged by visiting heads of state than encircled by the United States and its allies. The convergence of Putin, Modi, and leaders from other emerging economies contrasts with the growing discord within the U.S. alliance with European and Asian countries. Despite concerns over China's conduct, some countries increasingly regard the United States as a destabilizing force in the international order. China has tried to use Washington's disorder to persuade countries like India to reassess their relationship with the United States. The summit and parade allowed Putin and Xi to reaffirm their close relationship, a partnership that the West has tried and largely failed to break.
