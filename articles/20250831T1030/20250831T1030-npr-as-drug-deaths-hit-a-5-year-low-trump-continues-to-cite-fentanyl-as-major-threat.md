## Article summary
Drug deaths in the U.S. have significantly declined since mid-2023, with the latest CDC data showing 77,648 fatalities in the year ending March 2025, the lowest since at least March 2020. Despite this drop, President Trump continues to emphasize fentanyl as a major threat, implementing policies like the 'Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act,' which imposes mandatory 10-year sentences for traffickers. Trump has also threatened military action against Mexico, imposed tariffs based on exaggerated claims, and falsely linked fentanyl trafficking to undocumented immigrants. His crime emergency campaign in Washington, D.C., aims to remove visible drug users and pressure them into treatment. Critics argue these tactics are misguided, as addiction is a chronic illness requiring ongoing management. Concerns also arise over potential cuts to health and addiction programs, which could hinder progress. States like West Virginia and larger ones such as California and New York have seen significant reductions in drug deaths, with some states reporting 30-40% improvements. Experts attribute the decline to disrupted supply chains and improved healthcare for addiction. The latest CDC data reverses a previous report of a slight uptick in deaths, confirming a consistent downward trend since mid-2023.
