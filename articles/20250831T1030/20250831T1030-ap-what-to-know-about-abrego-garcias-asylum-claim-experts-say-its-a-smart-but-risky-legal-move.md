## Article summary
Klmar Abrego Garca's request for asylum in the United States is a strategic but risky move to fight deportation efforts by the Trump administration. Experts say it provides better legal options but could result in his return to a notorious El Salvador prison where he claims he was abused. Abrego Garca, 30, became a focal point in the debate over Trump's immigration policies after being wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March. The administration initially deported him based on allegations of gang affiliation, which he denies. A U.S. immigration judge had previously barred his deportation to El Salvador due to credible threats from a local gang. After a Supreme Court order, he was returned to the U.S. but faced human smuggling charges. The administration now intends to deport him to Uganda, which he fears due to documented human rights abuses. Asylum could end the fight, but reopening his 2019 immigration case is risky. If denied, he could be sent back to the El Salvador prison. His lawyers argue he has the right to request asylum now due to his recent wrongful deportation. The asylum petition will go through the U.S. immigration court system, under the Trump administration's authority. Despite having a legal team and federal judge monitoring his case, the government is likely to appeal any asylum approval. The outcome depends on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has been generally favorable to asylum claims.
