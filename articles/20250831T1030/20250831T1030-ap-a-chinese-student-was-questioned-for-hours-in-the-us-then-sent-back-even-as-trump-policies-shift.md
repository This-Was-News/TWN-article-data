## Article summary
A 22-year-old Chinese philosophy student, identified only by his family name Gu, was detained and interrogated for 36 hours upon arriving in Texas to study at the University of Houston, despite having valid paperwork and a scholarship. He was subsequently deported and banned from re-entering the U.S. for five years, halting his academic aspirations. This incident is part of a broader trend where Chinese students with valid visas have faced intense questioning and deportation, drawing protests from Beijing and highlighting uncertainties in U.S. policies under President Trump. While Trump has expressed a desire to welcome Chinese students, some officials and lawmakers have raised concerns about students studying advanced technologies and their potential links to the Chinese government. The Chinese Embassy reported over 10 cases of students and scholars being interrogated, harassed, and deported, often under the pretext of visa issues or national security concerns. Gu's experience included prolonged questioning about his ties to the Chinese Communist Party and government scholarships, despite his claims of no direct involvement. The embassy criticized the U.S. for discriminatory enforcement actions, while Gu considers appealing the deportation decision, facing potential financial and temporal challenges.
