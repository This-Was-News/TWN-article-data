## Article summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has experienced significant turmoil this week. CDC Director Susan Monarez, who led the agency for less than a month, was forced out after refusing to endorse what her attorneys described as 'unscientific, reckless directives.' Her departure followed a contentious meeting with Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy appointed Jim O'Neill, a top advisor with no medical background, as the acting CDC director. O'Neill, known for his libertarian views and criticism of the CDC's pandemic response, will serve in both roles as acting CDC director and deputy secretary of HHS. Three top CDC leaders, including Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry, resigned in protest of Monarez's firing and the agency's new direction. The resignations came after a gunman attacked the CDC headquarters, motivated by discontent with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and amid layoffs and a shift in the CDC's focus to solely address infectious diseases. Senate HELP Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, who supported Kennedy's confirmation, has called for oversight of the CDC resignations, while ranking Democrat Bernie Sanders has requested a hearing on the leadership upheaval.
