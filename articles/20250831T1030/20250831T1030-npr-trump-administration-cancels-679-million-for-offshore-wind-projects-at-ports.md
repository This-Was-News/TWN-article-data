## Article summary
The Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal funding for offshore wind projects at ports, marking the latest move in its campaign against wind power. Offshore wind is a developing industry in the U.S., requiring substantial infrastructure at ports for construction. Twelve port projects, from California to Virginia, had received funds under the Biden administration, all of which are now being withdrawn or canceled. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that the funds would be redirected to critical port upgrades. Critics, like Rep. Jared Huffman, argue that this decision will destroy clean energy sectors and kill jobs. The Trump administration has also ordered a halt to construction on a Rhode Island wind farm, citing national security interests. The wind industry is reeling from these decisions, which contrast with previous growth driven by increasing electricity demand. The Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project in California, which stood to lose over $426 million, represents a significant economic opportunity for the rural area. Despite the funding cancellation, the port's director remains hopeful, noting the ongoing push for renewable energy in California. The Trump administration's moratorium on new offshore wind projects has created uncertainty, but industry experts believe the demand for electricity will ultimately drive the development of offshore wind.
