## Article summary
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Tianjin on August 31, 2025, during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. They pledged to resolve border differences and strengthen cooperation, marking Modi's first visit to China since the 2020 border clashes. Modi noted improvements in relations and a peaceful environment at the borders. Xi emphasized the importance of not letting the border issue define the overall relationship and focused on economic development. Both leaders agreed to prioritize partnership over rivalry. Russian President Vladimir Putin is also in Tianjin and is scheduled to meet with both leaders. Earlier in August, China's top diplomat Wang Yi visited New Delhi, where both sides announced a rapprochement, including the resumption of border talks, visa issuance, and direct flights. Despite U.S. tariffs on India, the two nations have been increasing official visits and discussing easing trade and movement restrictions. In June, China allowed Indian pilgrims to visit holy sites in Tibet.
