## Article summary
An Israeli airstrike killed Ahmed al-Rahaw, the prime minister of the Houthi rebel-controlled government in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The strike occurred during a routine government workshop, also wounding other ministers and officials. Al-Rahaw was not part of the inner circle running the group's military affairs but managed civilian matters in Houthi-held areas. The strike targeted a meeting of Houthi leaders in a villa in southern Sanaa. Israel confirmed the strike, stating it targeted senior officials responsible for terror actions against Israel. The Houthi leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, had vowed retaliation against Israel earlier. The U.S. and Israel have been conducting airstrikes against the Houthis in response to their attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Israel. The killing of al-Rahaw is seen as a significant setback for the Houthis, marking a shift in Israel's strategy to target rebel leaders. The Houthis had previously agreed to a deal with the Trump administration to end airstrikes in exchange for halting attacks on shipping, but they maintained the right to target perceived Israeli-aligned entities.
