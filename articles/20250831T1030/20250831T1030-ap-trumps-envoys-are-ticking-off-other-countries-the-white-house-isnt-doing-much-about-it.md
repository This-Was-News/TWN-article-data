## Article summary
Recent incidents involving U.S. envoys have sparked diplomatic tensions. Denmark summoned the U.S. ambassador over reports of covert influence operations in Greenland linked to Trump associates. France also summoned the U.S. ambassador, Charles Kushner, over his letter to President Macron criticizing France's handling of antisemitism. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey, Tom Barrack, apologized for using the word 'animals' during a press conference in Lebanon. The Trump administration largely stood by its envoys, with the White House dismissing concerns about diplomatic fallout. The incidents reflect Trump's blunt diplomatic style and 'America First' approach, which have alienated some allies. The administration emphasizes its foreign policy achievements, including trade deals and the release of detained Americans. Analysts warn that these diplomatic missteps could strain relationships with Western allies amid rising tensions with China. The French Foreign Ministry firmly rejected Kushner's allegations, highlighting the strain on transatlantic relations. Denmark's Foreign Ministry also sought explanations for the reported influence operations in Greenland. Despite these incidents, the Trump administration shows no signs of changing its approach, leaving other countries to decide how to manage their relations with the U.S.
