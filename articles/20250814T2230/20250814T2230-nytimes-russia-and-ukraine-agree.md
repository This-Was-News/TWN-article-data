## Article summary
The upcoming summit between President Trump and President Putin in Alaska is seen as a significant victory for Russia, as it brings Putin out of diplomatic isolation and provides him with an opportunity to influence the American president. Both Russia and Ukraine agree that the summit is a win for Putin, as it elevates his status and gives him a platform to push his agenda. The summit has also caused discord within NATO, a long-standing Russian goal, and postponed Trump's threat of new sanctions against Russia. Putin's objectives include securing Trump's support for Russian proposals and turning the situation to his favor. The summit may also discuss other issues like economic ties and nuclear weapons. Trump has suggested that a peace deal could involve land swaps, which Ukraine's President Zelensky has rejected. The summit is seen as a tactical maneuver by Putin to manipulate Trump, who believes in his negotiation skills. However, Putin's ultimate goals remain unclear, and the summit's outcomes are uncertain.
