## Article summary
President Trump's upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska has raised expectations and concerns. While Trump portrays the meeting as a chance to reset his relationship with Putin and showcase his deal-making skills, the stakes are high, particularly for Ukraine and NATO allies. Trump aims to position himself as a peacemaker, but the risks include potential concessions to Russia, such as territorial swaps, which could undermine Ukraine's sovereignty. Putin, meanwhile, seeks to end his isolation by the West and may use the meeting to distract from the war in Ukraine and secure economic benefits. The meeting could also strain NATO alliances if Putin drives a wedge between Trump and European allies. For Trump, the meeting is an opportunity to save face and bolster his peacemaker credentials, but it comes with significant geopolitical risks. The outcome could impact ongoing conflicts, arms control treaties, and future U.S. relations with Russia and its allies.
