## Article summary
President Trump is exerting unprecedented control over U.S. business, with corporate America largely staying silent. In recent weeks, Trump has intensified pressure on major companies and their CEOs, demanding concessions and publicly attacking executives. Notably, he struck a deal with Nvidia for a 15% share of its H20 chip sales in China, raising concerns about government interference in private business. Critics argue this move defies free-market capitalism and resembles state capitalism. Trump's actions have sparked worries among business leaders, who fear cronyism and the erosion of independent decision-making. Despite Trump's aggressive policies, many CEOs avoid public criticism, fearing retaliation. However, some, like Intel's CEO, have successfully appealed to Trump privately. Meanwhile, Trump continues to target other companies, such as Goldman Sachs, over economic policies. His actions have also extended to undermining the independence of institutions like the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Despite economic concerns, U.S. markets remain strong, and investors seem unfazed. Analysts predict that significant economic damage will be necessary before CEOs publicly oppose Trump, emphasizing the need for collective action to counter his influence.
