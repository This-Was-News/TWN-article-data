## Article summary
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a special election on November 4 to seek voter approval for a new congressional map aimed at securing five more U.S. House seats for Democrats in 2026. This move is a direct response to a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas, supported by former President Donald Trump, to maintain their slim House majority. Texas Republicans are considering a new map to send five more Republicans to Washington, while California Democrats plan to make their campaign about defending American democracy and rejecting Trump's policies. Newsom encouraged other Democratic-led states to join the fight, stating that California alone cannot stand against the nationwide threat to democracy. The new California map would only take effect if a Republican state moves forward with its own maps and would remain in place until the 2030 elections. Some opponents, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, plan to campaign against the effort, while Republicans criticize Newsom's move as a power grab. Meanwhile, U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted patrols outside Newsom's news conference, drawing condemnation from the governor.
