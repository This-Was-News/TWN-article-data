## Article summary
The Associated Press celebrated the 100th anniversary of its All-America football team by announcing an all-time team, with Ohio State and Pittsburgh each placing three players on the list. Since 1925, nearly 2,000 men have been named AP first-team All-Americans, one of the most prestigious honors in college football. The Big Ten led all conferences with seven selections. The all-time team includes 25 players, five of whom won the Heisman Trophy and 21 are in the College Football Hall of Fame. A panel of 12 AP sports writers selected the team, which is not definitive due to the vast number of great players over the last century. To qualify, players must have been an AP first-team All-American at least once, and their professional careers were not considered. Notable selections include Tim Tebow as the all-time first-team quarterback, Barry Sanders and Herschel Walker as running backs, and Randy Moss and Larry Fitzgerald as wide receivers. The team also features legendary players like Orlando Pace, John Hannah, and Chuck Bednar on the offensive line, and Charles Woodson, Deion Sanders, and Ronnie Lott in the secondary. The selection process aimed to avoid recency bias, but only three players from before 1970 made the team. Fans noted the omission of players like Anthony Munoz and Ray Guy, who were not first-team AP All-Americans during their college careers.
