## Article summary
Researchers have found that taking around 7,000 steps a day is associated with significant health benefits, including a nearly 50% lower risk of dying compared to taking just 2,000 steps. This number is backed by studies showing reduced risks of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and dementia. While exceeding 7,000 steps offers additional benefits, the improvements become smaller. Studies also indicate that even modest increases in steps, such as from 2,000 to 4,000, can have a major impact on well-being. The optimal step count may vary with age, with older adults needing fewer steps than younger adults. Speed of walking does not seem to affect the benefits, as the total number of steps matters more. Experts recommend a balanced approach to physical activity, including mobility and strength training. The federal guidelines focus on minutes of exercise rather than steps, but there is a push to include step counts in future updates. Ultimately, any physical activity is better than none, and more steps are better than fewer, especially for those who spend a lot of time sitting.
