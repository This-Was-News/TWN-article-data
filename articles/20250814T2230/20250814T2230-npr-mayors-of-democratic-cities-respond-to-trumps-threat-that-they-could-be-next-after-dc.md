## Article summary
Mayors of major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Oakland, Baltimore, and New York, have criticized President Trump's threats to take federal control of their cities' police forces, similar to his actions in Washington, D.C. These mayors, all of whom are Black and Democrats, argue that crime rates in their cities are down and that Trump's claims are politically motivated. They have vowed not to allow federal law enforcement to take over their cities, viewing Trump's actions as an attempt to dismantle democracy. Legal experts agree that Trump lacks the authority to federalize local law enforcement in these cities, as they are governed by state laws. The White House, however, maintains that these cities are among the most dangerous in America and should focus on improving their own streets. The mayors have also highlighted the need for federal support in addressing issues like gun violence and human trafficking, but not through military intervention. They argue that Trump's actions are a test for authoritarian control and a scapegoating of Black and Brown communities.
