## Article summary
Mpox, once a major global health concern, has seen a decline in cases but remains a significant threat, particularly in Africa. The virus has spread rapidly across 24 African countries, with over 97,000 suspected cases and nearly 600 deaths this year. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern a year ago, but critics argue the global response has been inadequate. The virus, initially associated with remote forested areas, has now spread to urban centers and among sex workers and their clients. Data on cases is limited due to stigma, remote locations, and reduced foreign aid. Vaccination efforts have fallen short, with only about 886,000 people vaccinated across a dozen African countries. The U.S. promised 1 million doses but has delivered only 90,000, with many doses expiring. Experts warn that the lack of a robust response could undermine future disease control efforts and the effectiveness of global health alert systems. Despite challenges, Africa CDC has made progress in building capacity, approving vaccines, and expanding laboratory networks. However, much more work is needed to contain the virus and prevent its further spread.
