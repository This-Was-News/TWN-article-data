## Article summary
A federal judge ordered the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to stop sharing Medicaid enrollees' personal data, including home addresses, with deportation officials. The data sharing began in June and was expanded in July, granting the Department of Homeland Security daily access to sensitive information of 79 million Medicaid enrollees. The policy was challenged by 20 states, including California, Arizona, Washington, and New York, due to privacy concerns. Judge Vince Chhabra's order temporarily halts the data sharing until the health department justifies its policy. The Trump administration's broader efforts to provide immigration enforcement agencies with more data on immigrants have raised alarms among advocates. Immigrants, including those seeking emergency medical care, may fear repercussions from sharing their information. The judge emphasized that using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement could disrupt the program's critical role in providing health coverage to vulnerable residents. The health department maintains that its agreement with DHS is legal, but critics argue that protecting private health information is vital for ensuring access to medical care without fear.
