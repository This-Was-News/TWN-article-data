## Article summary
A federal judge has struck down two Trump administration actions targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and colleges. Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Education Department violated the law by threatening to cut federal funding from institutions continuing DEI initiatives. The guidance has been on hold since April when federal judges blocked various parts of the anti-DEI measures. The ruling followed a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association challenging the government's actions. The case centered on two Education Department memos ordering schools to end race-based decision-making or face penalties, including loss of federal funding. The judge ordered the department to scrap the guidance, stating it violated procedural requirements. The memos expanded the government's interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring race-based admissions, applying it across all educational aspects. The memos drew backlash from states and education groups, calling it illegal government censorship. The American Federation of Teachers argued the government imposed unclear and subjective limits on schools, forcing them to choose between protected speech and risking federal funds.
