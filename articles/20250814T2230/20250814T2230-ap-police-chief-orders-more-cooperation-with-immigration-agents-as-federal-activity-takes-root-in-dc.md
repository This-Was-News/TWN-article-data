## Article summary
The D.C. police chief has increased cooperation between local officers and federal immigration agents, allowing information sharing and transportation assistance. This change erodes the district's long-standing policy against cooperating with civil immigration enforcement. Mayor Muriel Bowser was out of town but expected to return. The city is tense as federal law enforcement presence increases, with National Guard troops stationed at landmarks and checkpoints. President Trump praised the police chief's order. Homeless people are being moved from encampments, with volunteers assisting. Federal agents are visible in various parts of the city, including popular areas like U Street and the National Mall. The National Guard is assisting with traffic control and crowd management. The White House denies diverting counterterrorism resources. The deployments are unprecedented but follow a gradual increase in federal presence. Protesters and advocates are critical of the administration's actions.
