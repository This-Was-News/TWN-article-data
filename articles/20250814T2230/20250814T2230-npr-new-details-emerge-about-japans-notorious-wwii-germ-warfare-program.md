## Article summary
As Japan approaches the 80th anniversary of its WWII defeat, new details about the notorious Unit 731, a Japanese germ warfare program, have emerged. Hideo Shimozawa, a 95-year-old former member of Unit 731, recently returned to China to apologize for the atrocities committed by the unit. The release of WWII-era military documents and the premiere of a film about Unit 731's inhumane medical experiments on Chinese victims have sparked discussions about this dark chapter in history. Shimozawa, who joined Unit 731 at age 14, recalled the shocking discoveries he made, including human organ specimens and the mistreatment of prisoners. The unit, which is estimated to have killed around 3,000 people, has never been officially acknowledged or apologized for by the Japanese government. Meanwhile, researchers have discovered a network of similar units across Asia, each adapting to local conditions to spread diseases among enemy forces. The leaders of Unit 731 avoided prosecution due to a deal with the U.S. government, which sought the unit's medical data in exchange for immunity. This decision has been criticized as a significant lapse of justice.
