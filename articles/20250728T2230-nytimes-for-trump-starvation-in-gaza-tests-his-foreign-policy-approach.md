## Article summary
President Trump has acknowledged the starvation crisis in Gaza, which has been exacerbated by Israeli bombardment and aid restrictions, leaving nearly two million Palestinians in a hunger crisis. During a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump promised to open new food sites in Gaza but did not specify how the aid would be delivered. He criticized the current aid distribution effort as ineffective and proposed setting up food centers without boundaries or fences. Trump has previously blamed Hamas for stealing aid and deflected questions about the hunger crisis, but recent discussions with European leaders have led him to acknowledge the severity of the situation. Humanitarian groups emphasize the need for a substantial increase in food aid, as the Israeli government has imposed a near-total blockade on food and medicine.
