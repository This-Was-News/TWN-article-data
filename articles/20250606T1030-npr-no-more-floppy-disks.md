## Article summary
The U.S. air traffic control system is facing significant challenges as it attempts to modernize, highlighted by recent outages at Newark Liberty International Airport that caused numerous delays. Acting FAA administrator Chris Rocheleau has emphasized the need to replace outdated technology, including floppy disks and paper flight strips, which have persisted for decades. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the overhaul as the most critical infrastructure project in recent history, supported by a coalition of industry stakeholders advocating for a new system. However, a lack of funding has hindered past modernization efforts, with estimates for a new system running into the tens of billions of dollars. The FAA is seeking input from private companies to innovate and lead the project, but obstacles remain, including the management of aging facilities and potential political resistance to consolidating air traffic control sites. Experts express skepticism about meeting the ambitious four-year timeline proposed by the Trump administration. Overall, while there is broad recognition of the need for change, the path to modernization is fraught with complexity and uncertainty.
