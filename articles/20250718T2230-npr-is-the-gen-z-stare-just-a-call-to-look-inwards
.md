## Article summary
The article discusses the "Gen Z stare," a viral term describing the tendency of Generation Z to stare blankly at others during interactions. This phenomenon is categorized into two types: the "customer service stare" by workers and the "customer stare" by customers. The article compares this generational tension to historical critiques of youth, noting that young people often reject established norms. Jennifer Grygiel, a social media expert, suggests that the stare might reflect boredom or a lack of experience in real-world socializing, rather than a unique generational trait. The article concludes by highlighting that criticisms of Gen Z may reflect broader societal issues and the need for more enriching interpersonal interactions.
