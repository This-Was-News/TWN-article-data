## Article summary
The U.S. economy is showing signs of strain due to President Trump's recent policies, including significant federal spending cuts, layoffs of government workers, and the imposition of tariffs on major trading partners. These actions have led to a decline in consumer and business sentiment, with rising inflation expectations and stalled investment plans. Economists warn that Trump's tariffs could increase prices and trigger trade wars, which may hinder economic growth. Local economies are feeling the impact of frozen federal funding, leading to potential tax increases and bond offerings to stabilize budgets.

The labor market, previously strong, is now at risk due to job cuts initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency. Protests have emerged in response to layoffs, and states like Pennsylvania are suing the administration over funding freezes affecting essential programs. Economic indicators reflect growing anxiety, with consumer sentiment dropping significantly and business expansion slowing amid uncertainty around new policies. The housing market is also under pressure from high mortgage rates and tariff concerns.

While Trump's advisers argue that these economic impacts will be offset by other policies, even some of his supporters express unease about the current economic climate, highlighting concerns over slower growth and higher inflation. The Federal Reserve is prioritizing inflation outlooks, indicating that relief in borrowing costs may not be forthcoming in the near future.
