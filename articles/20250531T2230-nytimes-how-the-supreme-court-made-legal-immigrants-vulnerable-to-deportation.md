## Article summary
The Supreme Court has made a significant decision that puts over 500,000 legally residing immigrants in the U.S., particularly from Haiti, Cuba, and Venezuela, at risk of deportation. Recent rulings have revoked protections from deportation, shifting many from lawful status to deportable status, which raises concerns about their vulnerability due to the detailed information they provided to the government. The Trump administration has been pushing for increased deportations, arguing that some immigration programs are being misused. The court's decisions target humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status, which previously shielded these immigrants. Critics, including immigrant advocacy groups, express alarm over the potential for a large-scale deportation effort, as the rulings effectively enable the administration to expedite removal processes for those who have been in the U.S. for less than two years. The administration's actions reflect a broader goal to streamline deportations and enhance immigration enforcement, including detaining individuals at immigration courts. While expedited removal is typically used at the border, the Trump administration's expansion allows for its application to a wider range of individuals. The implications of these rulings are profound, potentially leading to aggressive enforcement measures against vulnerable populations.
