## Article summary
Kari Lake, a senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, has initiated significant layoffs at the Voice of America (VOA), reducing its workforce by 85%, or 1,400 positions. This decision follows an executive order from President Trump aimed at restructuring the agency, which oversees various government-funded international networks. Lake described the cuts as necessary to eliminate a "bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy," criticizing the agency for dysfunction and bias. The layoffs, affecting a majority of VOA's staff, are set to take effect on September 1.

In the wake of escalating conflicts, Lake has reinstated some staff to reestablish the Persian-language service, although many of those called back also received layoff notices. Employees have expressed that these actions threaten 83 years of independent journalism that supports U.S. democratic ideals. The agency's director and other networks have filed lawsuits against Lake, citing concerns over the agency's ability to provide objective news globally. Lake has raised allegations of security issues within the agency, echoing claims made by previous Trump appointees. She is scheduled to testify at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing titled "Spies, Lies and Mismanagement."
