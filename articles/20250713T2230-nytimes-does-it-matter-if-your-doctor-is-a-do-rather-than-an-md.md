## Article summary
The number of doctors of osteopathic medicine (D.O.s) has grown significantly, with over a quarter of U.S. medical students training to become D.O.s. Despite their increasing presence, many patients are unaware of the differences between D.O.s and M.D.s, often confusing them with other types of practitioners. Historically, D.O.s focused on holistic care and manual adjustments, but today their training and practice closely resemble those of M.D.s, with minimal differences in patient outcomes. D.O.s are more likely to work in rural areas and primary care, a trend attributed to both practical factors and the osteopathic philosophy of serving underserved communities. The distinct identity of osteopathic medicine is fading, raising questions about its future as a separate profession, especially since the U.S. is the only developed country with two fully licensed medical professions.
