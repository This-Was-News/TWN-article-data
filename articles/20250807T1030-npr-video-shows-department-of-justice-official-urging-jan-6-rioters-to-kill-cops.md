## Article summary
Video footage and transcripts from January 6, 2021, show Jared Wse, now a senior advisor at the Department of Justice, berating and encouraging rioters to attack police officers. Wse, a former FBI agent, was not convicted of any crimes related to the Capitol riot due to President Trump's order to end all related prosecutions. He acknowledged yelling 'kill 'em' during the riot but claimed it was an angry reaction to perceived police brutality. Wse's trial was dismissed after Trump took office and ordered the case dropped. He now works on internal reviews of alleged 'weaponization' of law enforcement. The Trump administration has pardoned over 1,500 January 6 defendants and closed active investigations into assaults on police. The administration has also settled a wrongful death suit related to the riot and demoted or fired prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases. Conservative activist Ed Martn, appointed as U.S. Pardon Attorney, has suggested that violence against police on January 6 may have been justified due to conspiracy theories about the event being 'staged'. The hiring of former January 6 defendants by the administration highlights its efforts to rewrite the history of the Capitol riot.
