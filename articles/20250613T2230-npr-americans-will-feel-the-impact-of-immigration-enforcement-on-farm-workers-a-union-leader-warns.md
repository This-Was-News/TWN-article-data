## Article summary
The United Farm Workers (UFW) union president, Teresa Romero, warns that increased immigration enforcement is instilling fear among agricultural workers, potentially impacting food availability for American households. Recent raids in California and New York have heightened this anxiety, leading many workers to feel terrified yet compelled to show up for work to support their families. Romero emphasizes the need for agricultural employers to educate their staff about legal rights and protections against unlawful enforcement actions. 

The UFW highlights that approximately 40% of crop farmworkers lack work authorization, which complicates their situation during raids. Romero asserts that current immigration practices target hardworking individuals rather than criminals, contradicting promises made during Trump's campaign. She argues that the economic consequences of these actions could lead to food shortages and increased prices for consumers. 

Romero calls for a more humane approach, urging that workers should be treated with dignity and their constitutional rights upheld. She stresses that the repercussions of immigration raids will ultimately affect everyone, as crops may go unharvested and prices could rise due to labor shortages. The situation calls for immediate attention, as the ongoing raids threaten the livelihoods of many and the stability of the food supply chain.
