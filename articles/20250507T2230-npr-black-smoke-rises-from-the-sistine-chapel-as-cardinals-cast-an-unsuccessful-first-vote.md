## Article summary
The first conclave vote for the next pope ended unsuccessfully, as indicated by black smoke rising from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel. The 133 cardinal electors were unable to reach the necessary two-thirds majority to elect a successor to the late Pope Francis. Following their initial vote, the cardinals will continue to meet daily, voting four times until a candidate secures the required majority. If no pope is elected after three days, there will be a day of prayer before voting resumes. The atmosphere in Rome is lively, with many pilgrims, journalists, and onlookers gathering in Vatican City to witness the proceedings. On Thursday morning, the cardinals will celebrate Mass before voting again. If the next vote is also unsuccessful, they will vote immediately again, maintaining a rigorous schedule of two votes each morning and afternoon in subsequent days. The conclave is a highly anticipated event for the Catholic Church, which serves over 1.4 billion followers worldwide.
