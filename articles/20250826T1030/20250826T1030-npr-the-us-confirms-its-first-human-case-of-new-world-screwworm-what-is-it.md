## Article summary
The U.S. has confirmed its first human case of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite typically affecting livestock. The case involved a Maryland resident who had traveled to El Salvador, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirming the infection on August 4. The individual has since recovered, and there is no indication of transmission to others. The New World screwworm, a parasitic fly, lays eggs on live animals, with larvae feeding on flesh, causing painful and potentially fatal infections. While human cases are rare, the parasite poses a significant threat to livestock, particularly cattle. The U.S. previously eradicated the screwworm in the 1960s using sterile insect technique, but recent outbreaks in Mexico and Central America have raised concerns about its northward spread. The U.S. has taken measures to combat the threat, including halting live-cattle imports from Mexico and announcing plans to build a sterile-fly production facility in Texas. The USDA is also investing in surveillance and technology to prevent further spread, with agricultural groups supporting these proactive steps to protect the livestock industry.
