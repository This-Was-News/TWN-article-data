## Article summary
Judges in Washington, D.C., are pushing back against recent criminal charges, citing concerns over federal overreach and unlawful searches. A federal judge dismissed a weapons case against Torez Rley, calling the search that led to his arrest 'the most illegal search' he had ever seen. Rley, a Black man, was allegedly singled out due to his appearance and the heavy backpack he was carrying. The case was dismissed after prosecutors reviewed body camera footage of the arrest. This incident comes amid heightened scrutiny of law enforcement in D.C., where President Trump has deployed federal officers and the National Guard to assist in crime prevention. U.S. Attorney Jeanne Prro has directed prosecutors to seek maximum charges and pretrial detention for defendants. Judge Za Faruqu expressed outrage over the charges, stating that criminal charges should not be filed recklessly. Prro defended her office's actions, criticizing the judge's history of releasing dangerous felons. The judge also noted that multiple search warrants have been suppressed in recent weeks, a highly unusual occurrence. The case highlights tensions between federal authorities and local judges over policing and prosecutorial decisions in D.C.
