## Article summary
Israel struck a major hospital in the Gaza Strip twice on Monday, killing at least 20 people, including five journalists and rescue workers. The first strike hit an upper floor of Khan Younis Nasser Hospital, and the second strike targeted the stairwell as journalists and rescuers rushed to the scene. Among the dead was Maram Dagga, a 33-year-old visual journalist who worked for The Associated Press. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called the strike a tragic mishap and stated that the military was investigating. The AP and Reuters demanded an explanation in a joint letter to Israeli authorities, condemning the attack on a location protected under international law. The hospital was already overwhelmed with patients, including many malnourished individuals, due to the ongoing war and famine in Gaza. The U.N. secretary-general, along with Britain, France, and others, condemned the attack. U.S. President Donald Trump initially expressed unhappiness about the strike but later suggested there might be a conclusive ending in Gaza in the coming weeks. The war, which began with a Hamas-led attack in 2023, has resulted in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis, with many journalists and health workers among the casualties.
