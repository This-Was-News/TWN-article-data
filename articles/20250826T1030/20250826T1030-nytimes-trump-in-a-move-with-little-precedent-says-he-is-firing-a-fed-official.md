## Article summary
President Trump announced on Monday that he was removing Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. Ms. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board, denied the allegations and vowed to fight her dismissal, stating that no legal cause exists for her removal. Trump justified the firing by pointing to claims that Ms. Cook falsified records to obtain favorable mortgage terms, though she has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Legal experts raised concerns about the legality of Trump's actions, warning that his intervention could compromise the Fed's independence. Trump invoked a power in the Fed's founding statute to remove governors for cause, but experts questioned whether the allegations met that standard. Ms. Cook's dismissal could give Trump a majority on the Fed's board, with members he has appointed. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, condemned the move as an authoritarian power grab that violates the Federal Reserve Act. The dismissal follows a pattern of political retaliation by Trump and his allies. Ms. Cook's departure would create a second vacancy on the seven-member board, allowing Trump to appoint another loyalist. The Fed plays a crucial role in monitoring inflation and the labor market, and a premature reduction in interest rates could cause severe economic damage. The legal battle over Ms. Cook's dismissal is likely to define the limits of Trump's power over the Fed.
