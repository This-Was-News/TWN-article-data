## Article summary
President Trump attempted to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, escalating his efforts to gain more control over the central bank. Trump cited allegations from a Trump ally that Cook made false statements on a mortgage application, claiming this undermined confidence in her integrity. Cook denied Trump's authority to remove her and vowed to continue her duties. Federal law requires Fed governors to be removed only for cause. Trump accused Cook of deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter. Earlier, Bill Pulte, a Trump loyalist, accused Cook of mortgage fraud, alleging she obtained two home loans with favorable terms by misrepresenting each property as her primary residence. Cook has not responded in detail to the allegations but insisted she would continue her role. Her attorney promised to fight the dismissal, calling it a flawed and unauthorized act. The move comes amid Trump's campaign to lower interest rates, with an existing vacancy on the Fed's board. If successful, removing Cook would create another vacancy, potentially giving Trump appointees a majority on the board. Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, defended Cook, calling the attempt a legal violation and an authoritarian power grab.
