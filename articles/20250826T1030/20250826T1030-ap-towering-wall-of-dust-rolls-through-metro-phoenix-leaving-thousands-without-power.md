## Article summary
A powerful storm in metro Phoenix on Monday generated a towering wall of dust, known as a haboob, which darkened the sky, blinded drivers, and caused widespread power outages and flight disruptions. Bernae Boykin Hitesman experienced the storm firsthand while driving her children home, describing the intense conditions where visibility was nearly zero. The haboob, characterized by strong winds and heavy rain, led to delays at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and damage to a terminal roof. Over 15,000 people lost power, primarily in Maricopa County. Richard Fley, a resident in Gilbert, noted the storm's impact on his home, including dust infiltrating through cracks and swaying trees. Despite the disruption, Fley acknowledged the haboob's spectacular and somewhat beautiful natural phenomenon. Phoenix has seen a drier-than-usual monsoon season, with varying rainfall across different regions of Arizona. Meteorologist Mark O'Malley explained that such variability is typical for monsoons. The forecast for metro Phoenix includes a 40% chance of rain on Tuesday, followed by drying conditions.
