## Article summary
President Trump announced the removal of Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's board of governors, citing unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Cook of falsifying records to obtain favorable mortgage terms on properties in Atlanta and Ann Arbor. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, has not been charged with any wrongdoing. She denied the allegations and vowed to continue her duties. Experts note that evidence of fraud is limited, and the legal basis for her removal is uncertain. The Fed's independence is crucial for economic stability, and political interference could have severe consequences. Similar investigations have been opened against other officials, including Senator Adam Schiff and Letitia James. The Federal Housing Finance Agency typically investigates mortgage fraud, but such cases are rarely pursued before a loan defaults.
