## Article summary
A federal judge ordered Kari Lake, a Trump administration official, to testify under oath regarding her efforts to dismantle Voice of America (VOA) despite congressional mandates. Judge Royce C. Lamberth criticized Lake for withholding information and accused her of verging on contempt of court. Lake rejected the judge's authority, arguing that district court judges often overstep their bounds. The case involves multiple plaintiffs, including VOA's director, journalists, and press advocacy groups. During the hearing, Lamberth criticized the Justice Department for vague responses and questioned Lake's actions, such as seeking funding, suspending staff, and negotiating with right-wing media outlets. Lake, who arrived at the agency in February, has significantly reduced VOA's operations, leaving fewer than 10% of journalists employed. The judge emphasized that VOA must fulfill its legal mandate to provide reliable and objective news. Congress has stipulated funding limits for the agency, and Lake's attempts to defund sister networks have been blocked by court rulings. The case highlights tensions between executive powers and congressional intent regarding federal broadcasting agencies.
