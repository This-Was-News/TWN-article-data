## Article summary
Lisa Cook has stated she will not resign from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, following President Trump's announcement of her removal. Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook, though she has not been charged or convicted. Cook's lawyer asserted there is no legal basis for her dismissal, and they will take necessary actions to challenge it. Cook was initially appointed to fill an unexpired term and was reappointed in 2023, with her full term set to end in 2038. Trump invoked a power in the Federal Reserve's founding statute to remove her, claiming the allegations compromise her ability to regulate effectively. Trump has previously targeted Fed Chair Jerome Powell but recently focused on Cook. Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Cook of falsifying mortgage records. Cook's removal could face legal challenges, as she was confirmed by the Senate in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.
