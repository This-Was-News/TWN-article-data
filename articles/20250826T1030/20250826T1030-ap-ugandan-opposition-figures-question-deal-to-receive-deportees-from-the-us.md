## Article summary
Ugandan opposition figures and others criticized an agreement with the United States to receive deported migrants, questioning the lack of parliamentary approval and alleging it eases political pressure on President Yoweri Museveni. The deal, which Ugandan officials say prefers African-origin deportees without criminal records, includes the possibility of housing high-profile detainee Klmar Abrego Garca. Opposition figures argue the agreement lacks parliamentary oversight and comes at a time when Uganda struggles to care for refugees from neighboring countries. The specifics of what Uganda gains from the deal remain unclear, with government officials not immediately available for comment. Museveni, an authoritarian leader in power since 1986, has seen his standing in Washington decline due to corruption, human rights concerns, and sanctions. The deal is seen as politically and economically advantageous for Museveni, easing U.S. pressure and potentially offering trade opportunities. Opposition lawmakers insist the agreement should be handled by Parliament and is flawed without parliamentary authorization. The U.S. has recently deported migrants to Eswatini and South Sudan, with Rwanda also agreeing to accept up to 250 deportees.
