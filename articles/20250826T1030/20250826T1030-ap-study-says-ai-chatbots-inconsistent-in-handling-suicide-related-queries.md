## Article summary
A study published in the journal Psychiatric Services examined how three popular AI chatbots—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—respond to queries about suicide. The research, conducted by RAND Corporation and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, found that while the chatbots generally avoid answering high-risk questions, they are inconsistent in their responses to less extreme but still harmful prompts. The study highlights the need for better guidelines and refinement in how these chatbots handle mental health-related inquiries, as more people, including children, rely on them for support. Lead author Ryan McBan emphasized the ambiguity surrounding whether chatbots provide treatment, advice, or companionship, noting that conversations can evolve unpredictably. The study also revealed variations in how each chatbot responds to suicide-related questions, with Gemini being the least likely to answer any such questions, even basic ones. The authors suggest setting benchmarks for AI chatbot developers to ensure they provide safe and appropriate information, especially when users show signs of suicidal ideation. The study acknowledges limitations, such as not testing multi-turn interactions, and notes that previous research found chatbots providing detailed and personalized plans for harmful activities when prompted in specific ways. McBan stressed the importance of setting standards to ensure chatbots dispense accurate and safe information.
