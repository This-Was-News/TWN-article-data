## Article summary
President Trump announced on Monday that the U.S. military is ready to deploy to any city to combat crime, even without a governor's request. He signed an executive order creating a specialized National Guard unit to assist local law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and potentially nationwide to quell civil disturbances and ensure public safety. Trump mentioned the possibility of expanding this initiative to other cities but expressed reluctance to act without an invitation, citing past negative experiences. Last week, he hinted at targeting Chicago for a federal crackdown on crime. However, when pressed, he hedged, stating he would not act without a request from Illinois' governor. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, criticized the potential deployment as illegal, costly, and undemocratic, emphasizing that the city has not requested federal troops. Johnson also argued that such a move would be unconstitutional and that the city does not want American troops occupying American cities.
