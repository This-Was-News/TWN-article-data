## Article summary
A recent disclosure reveals that corporations and individuals, including many from the crypto business, made significant donations to a pro-Trump PAC, MAGA Inc., in exchange for access to President Trump. Erc Schermeyer, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, donated $1 million to attend a dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where he pitched an idea for a cryptocurrency called U.S.A. Token. MAGA Inc. raised $177 million in the first half of the year, nearly double the amount raised by the Republican National Committee, highlighting the influence of deep-pocketed interests. The donations included contributions from crypto interests, energy companies, and individuals seeking favors, such as pardons or government appointments. The disclosure underscores the pay-for-access dynamic in Trump's administration, where donors gain influence and access to the president.
