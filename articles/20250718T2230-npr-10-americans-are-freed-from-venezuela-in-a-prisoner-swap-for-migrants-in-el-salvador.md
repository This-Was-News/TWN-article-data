## Article summary
Venezuela has freed 10 Americans in exchange for Venezuelans detained in El Salvador, as confirmed by the U.S. and Salvadoran governments. The swap, negotiated over months, involved Venezuelans accused of gang affiliations and included U.S. citizens and permanent residents designated as wrongfully detained. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele announced the exchange, highlighting the release of Venezuelan political prisoners and Americans, with U.S. officials assisting in the arrangement. The Venezuelans were initially deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, with lawyers arguing their transfer was illegal. The prisoner swap was kept secret until its announcement, bringing relief to families of the detained Venezuelans, including Carlos Uzcategui, whose family denies gang affiliations.
