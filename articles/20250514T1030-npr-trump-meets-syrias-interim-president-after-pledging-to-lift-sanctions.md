## Article summary
President Trump met with Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, discussing the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Syria, a move deemed crucial for the country's recovery from civil war. Trump described the sanctions as "crippling" and expressed hope that their removal would provide Syria a "chance for greatness." He encouraged Sharaa to normalize relations with Israel through the Abraham Accords and to take steps against terrorism. The meeting was facilitated by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who praised Trump's decision. 

Sharaa, previously designated a terrorist due to past affiliations, has sought to present himself as a unifying leader, despite ongoing concerns about his government’s approach to ethnic minorities. His diplomatic efforts have included outreach to Arab nations and meetings with leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron, who supports sanction relief. The sanctions had previously limited Syria's access to international investment, pushing the country toward reliance on Russian support. With the lifting of sanctions, Gulf states are eager to invest in Syria's resources, which include significant mineral and oil reserves. Trump's announcement was met with enthusiasm at a Saudi investment forum, highlighting the strategic interest in rebuilding Syria.
