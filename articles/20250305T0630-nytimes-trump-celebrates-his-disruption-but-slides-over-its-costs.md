## Article summary
In a recent speech to Congress, President Trump celebrated the disruptions he has implemented, including tariffs, cuts to the federal workforce, and a shift in U.S. foreign policy. His address, marked by applause from Republicans and protests from Democrats, largely ignored the potential costs of these actions. Trump emphasized the need for swift action and framed his policies as necessary responses to perceived waste and fraud, but he failed to address the broader implications of his decisions. Notably, he did not discuss the economic fallout from escalating trade wars or the impact on U.S. allies, particularly in light of his alignment with Russia amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 

While he acknowledged an overture from Ukrainian President Zelensky for peace talks, Trump maintained his ban on further military aid to Ukraine. On trade, he insisted on maintaining high tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China without offering clarity on their long-term effects. The speech was characterized as more of a performance aimed at garnering applause rather than a serious examination of policy, leaving many critical issues unaddressed. Critics, including newly elected Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin, raised concerns about the ramifications of Trump's actions, particularly regarding national security and the treatment of federal workers. Overall, the speech reflected Trump's trademark style of disruption while glossing over the deeper challenges facing his administration and the nation.
