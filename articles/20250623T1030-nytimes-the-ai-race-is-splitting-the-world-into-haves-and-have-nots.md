## Article summary
The article discusses the growing divide in artificial intelligence (A.I.) computing power, which is creating a split between nations with advanced A.I. capabilities and those without. The U.S., China, and the European Union dominate the landscape, hosting over half of the world's powerful data centers, while many countries, particularly in Africa and South America, lack access to such resources. The disparity affects geopolitical dynamics, scientific advancements, and economic opportunities, as those with A.I. computing power can leverage it for innovation and military applications. The article highlights the challenges faced by countries with limited A.I. infrastructure, such as high costs and dependence on foreign technology, which can lead to brain drain. As the demand for powerful microchips like GPUs increases, nations are scrambling to build their own data centers and invest in A.I. resources to gain technological sovereignty. Countries like India and Brazil are taking steps to develop local A.I. capabilities, while Africa is exploring regional collaborations for computing hubs. The article emphasizes the urgency for many nations to secure A.I. resources to avoid being left behind in the global tech race. Despite efforts, the gap remains significant, and the article warns that without intervention, the divide will only widen.
