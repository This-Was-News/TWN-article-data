## Article summary
The Chelmsford Immigration Court, opened to reduce Boston's backlog, faces severe understaffing with only seven judges remaining out of the intended 21. Judges have been leaving or being dismissed, exacerbating a national backlog of 3.7 million cases. The Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal government and increase immigration arrests have collided with the immigration system. Attorneys report frequent case rescheduling and delays, with some clients waiting over a decade for hearings. The court's vacancies and political pressures have created uncertainty and dread among judges. The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) claims progress in reducing the backlog, but advocates argue due process is undermined. Judges like Nancy Griffiths and George Pappas have left, citing abrupt terminations and demoralizing processes. The court's struggles highlight broader issues in the immigration system, including resource allocation and the impact on immigrants' lives.
