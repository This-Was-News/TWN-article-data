## Article summary
President Trump has ordered the deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., to address homelessness and crime. Homeless individuals refusing shelter may face fines or jail time, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Despite crime rates hitting a 30-year low, Trump claims homelessness and drug use are causing disorder. Critics argue the policy will displace and incarcerate homeless people without solving the underlying issues. Experts highlight the lack of shelter beds and treatment facilities for addiction. Trump's administration has cut funding for addiction treatment and rental assistance, exacerbating the problem. Advocates emphasize the need for affordable housing and support services rather than punishment. Homeless individuals express confusion and fear about the crackdown. The White House plans similar actions in other cities, raising concerns about a national trend of criminalizing homelessness.
