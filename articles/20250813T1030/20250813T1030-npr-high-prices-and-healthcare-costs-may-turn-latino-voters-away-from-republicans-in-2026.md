## Article summary
Support for President Trump and the Republican Party is declining among Latino voters due to economic concerns, particularly high prices and healthcare costs. About a third of Latino Trump supporters from the previous election are uncertain about voting Republican in the upcoming midterms. Key issues driving this shift include persistent high grocery prices, lack of affordable healthcare, and dissatisfaction with the current economy. While some remain optimistic about Republican reforms, others express growing frustration with Trump's economic policies. Latino voters, often considered swing voters, are increasingly dissatisfied with both major parties. A significant majority of Latino voters rate the economy as poor, with many feeling it is worsening under Trump. Tariffs imposed by Trump have contributed to rising consumer prices, which could further alienate Latino voters. Despite this discontent, support has not yet shifted towards Democrats, with many voters expressing uncertainty about their political allegiance. Democrats have an opportunity to win over Latino voters by addressing economic concerns, but they must present a compelling vision to do so. The outcome of this shift could significantly impact the control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections.
