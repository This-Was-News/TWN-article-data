## Article summary
President Trump has become a central figure in the semiconductor industry, making significant decisions that impact global operations. He recently negotiated a 15% fee with Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, for granting export licenses to sell AI chips to China. Trump's interventions include threatening to revoke government grants, imposing tariffs, and demanding investments from companies like Intel. His actions have shifted the industry from careful planning to political negotiations, marking a departure from previous hands-off economic policies. The legalities of Trump's deals remain unclear, with no precedent for collecting fees in exchange for export licenses. The industry is on edge due to the unpredictability, as companies prefer stability for long-term planning. Trump is pressuring the industry to manufacture more advanced chips in the U.S., citing national security concerns. His administration has also restricted semiconductor sales to China and encouraged major investments in U.S. manufacturing. CEOs are navigating Trump's demands by forming direct relationships with him, as lobbying through industry associations is less effective. Despite setbacks, Nvidia's Huang has emerged as a key player, negotiating deals and maintaining a relationship with Trump.
