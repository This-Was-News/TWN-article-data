## Article summary
Corporate spending on artificial intelligence is surging, with executives expecting significant efficiency gains, but so far, the impact on the bottom line has been minimal. Nearly 80% of companies have reported using generative AI, yet many have seen no substantial financial benefits. Despite advancements in AI technology, including chatbots like ChatGPT, businesses outside the tech sector are struggling to see a return on their investments. Issues such as chatbots making up information and resistance from employees and customers are contributing to the slow adoption. Investments in generative AI are expected to increase by 94% this year to $61.9 billion, but many companies are abandoning their AI projects due to technical and human factors. Gartner predicts that AI will enter a phase of disillusionment before becoming a proven productivity tool. Companies like USAA and Johnson Controls are finding ways to incorporate AI, though it is still far from replacing human workers. JPMorgan Chase has integrated AI assistants for tasks like data retrieval and investment advice, reporting efficiency gains. Despite setbacks, experts agree that innovation involves trial and error, and the long-term vision is for AI to improve multiple business systems over the next five years.
