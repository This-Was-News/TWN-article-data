## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that ceasefire negotiations with Hamas are now focused on a comprehensive deal to release all remaining hostages simultaneously, rather than in phases. Mediation efforts by Egypt and Qatar aim to secure a lasting ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the release of all hostages. Despite previous setbacks, talks resumed with a Hamas delegation arriving in Cairo. Israel has threatened to expand its military offensive in Gaza, where most of the territory's 2 million residents have sought refuge, sparking international condemnation. Hamas continues to hold 50 hostages, with Israel believing around 20 are alive. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel's demands remain unchanged, insisting on the return of all hostages and Hamas's surrender. The United Nations warned of severe malnutrition and starvation in Gaza, with 222 people having died from related causes. Humanitarian supplies entering Gaza are insufficient to meet the population's needs, facing delays and impediments from Israeli authorities. Meanwhile, the Israeli military struck a group of militants disguised as aid workers, using a vehicle with the logo of the international charity World Central Kitchen. The charity condemned the impersonation, which endangers civilians and aid workers.
