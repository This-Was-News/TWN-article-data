## Article summary
Vietnam is aiming to become Asia's next tiger economy by 2045, undergoing its most ambitious economic overhaul in decades. The country has seen remarkable growth, with the average Vietnamese income rising over 13 times since 1990. However, it faces challenges such as an aging population, climate risks, and institutional reforms. Vietnam's trade surplus with the U.S. has drawn attention, with a 20% levy agreed upon to avoid higher tariffs. The country is diversifying its economy, investing in high-tech sectors, infrastructure, and aiming to become a global financial center. Institutional reforms include merging ministries and consolidating provinces. Vietnam is also encouraging private businesses to lead its economic push, with plans to elevate 20 private firms to a global scale by 2030. Climate change poses significant risks, with potential GDP losses and increased poverty if action isn't taken. Additionally, Vietnam is addressing its aging population by expanding healthcare access and promoting women's participation in the workforce.
