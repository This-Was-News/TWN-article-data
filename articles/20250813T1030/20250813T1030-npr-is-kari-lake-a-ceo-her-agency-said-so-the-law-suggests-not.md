## Article summary
Kari Lake, a Trump administration advisor, has been referred to as the acting CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America. However, there is no public evidence that President Trump officially appointed her to this position, and former federal officials suggest she may not be legally eligible. Lake's exact role is unclear, with titles shifting between various forms of 'senior advisor.' This ambiguity raises legal questions about the validity of her decisions, including the dismissal of nearly the entire workforce of Voice of America. Legal experts argue that her actions could be challenged, as seen in a similar case involving an unlawful appointment. The White House and Lake have not provided documentation clarifying her role. Lake's background includes being a former news anchor and a vocal supporter of Trump's policies. She has been instrumental in the agency's recent changes, which have significantly reduced its operations. The legal and ethical implications of her role are under scrutiny, with potential consequences for both Lake and the agency.
