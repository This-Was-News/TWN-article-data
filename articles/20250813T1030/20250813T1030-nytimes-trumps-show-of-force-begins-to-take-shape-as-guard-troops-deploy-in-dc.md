## Article summary
President Trump's plan to deploy federal forces to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C., began taking shape as National Guard troops appeared near the Washington Monument on Tuesday evening. The deployment, however, seemed less intimidating, with troops taking photos with visitors. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced a campaign to arrest violent criminals, while Mayor Muriel Bowser criticized Trump's actions as authoritarian and misleading. Federal and local officials met to coordinate efforts, with plans to address crime hotspots and homeless encampments. The law invoked allows Trump to control the city's police force for up to 30 days, with 800 National Guard members and 500 federal agents deployed. Disagreements over command structure and local laws remain unresolved. Crime prevention advocates warned of potential collateral consequences, particularly for young Black males. Trump's previous deployment of federal agents in 2020 escalated tensions and was criticized by the Justice Department inspector general. The current crackdown could have political and social repercussions, with concerns about its long-term impact on the city.
