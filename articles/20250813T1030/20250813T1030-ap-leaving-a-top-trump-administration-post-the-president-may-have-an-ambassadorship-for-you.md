## Article summary
The article discusses how President Donald Trump has been offering ambassadorships to officials leaving top administration posts, often after rocky tenures. Recent examples include National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who was nominated as UN ambassador after a security lapse, IRS Commissioner Billy Long, tapped as ambassador to Iceland after messaging inconsistencies, and State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, named deputy UN representative after internal struggles. These moves are seen as consolation prizes to keep loyalists close and prevent criticism. Trump's second administration has fewer high-profile departures, with those leaving often praised and kept in his political orbit. Ambassadors serve at the president's pleasure, and Trump can nominate anyone, though many require Senate confirmation. The White House views these positions as honors for loyal supporters. Former officials like John Bolton and Robert Wood have commented on the strategic nature of these reassignments. The article also notes that not all transitions are smooth, as seen with former spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, who faced criticism from Trump before a brief tenure as a special advisor to the UN.
