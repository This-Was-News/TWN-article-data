## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin has evolved since his second-term inauguration. Initially conciliatory towards Putin, Trump's tone shifted as Putin rejected a proposed truce, leading to increased frustration. Trump had previously suggested Russia was more willing to negotiate than Ukraine but softened his stance towards Zelenskyy after a February confrontation. He promised to provide Ukraine with Patriot air defense missiles under a deal involving NATO allies. The war in Ukraine, now in its 3.5 years, continues with intense fighting and high casualties. Trump has expressed exasperation with Putin's unyielding stance and the prolonged conflict. He has also criticized Zelenskyy for not showing gratitude and accused him of falling into a Russian disinformation trap. Despite initial support pauses, Trump has since agreed to send more weapons to Ukraine. He has publicly criticized Putin's attacks on Kyiv and expressed disappointment in Putin's actions. Trump has threatened secondary tariffs on Russia's trading partners if a peace deal isn't reached within 50 days and discussed rejuvenating the pipeline for U.S. weapons to Ukraine with NATO allies.
