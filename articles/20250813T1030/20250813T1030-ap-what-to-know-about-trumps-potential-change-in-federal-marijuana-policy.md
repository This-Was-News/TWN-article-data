## Article summary
President Donald Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a move that could align federal policy with many states that have already legalized its recreational or medical use. Currently, marijuana is a federal crime with severe penalties, but reclassifying it from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug could ease regulations, tax burdens, and research restrictions. The Justice Department proposed this change under former President Joe Biden, but no decision was made before he left office. Trump is now reviewing the policy, noting the benefits of medical marijuana but acknowledging its potential downsides. Advocacy groups support this change, while some conservatives and law enforcement groups oppose it due to concerns about abuse and safety. Despite recent setbacks in some states, public support for legalization remains high, with 68% of Americans favoring it. Marijuana use has also increased, particularly among adults aged 26 and older, though younger adults still use it the most. The reclassification would not legalize recreational use nationwide but could significantly impact the marijuana industry and research.
