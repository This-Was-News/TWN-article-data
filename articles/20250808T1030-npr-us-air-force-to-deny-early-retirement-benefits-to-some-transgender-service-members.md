## Article summary
The U.S. Air Force announced it will deny early retirement benefits to transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years, instead separating them without retirement benefits. This decision leaves them with the choice of taking a lump-sum separation payment or being removed from service. The Air Force spokesperson mentioned that no exceptions were approved for those who applied, and about a dozen service members were initially notified they could retire before the decision was reversed. This move follows the Pentagon's policy, permitted by the Supreme Court, to ban all transgender troops from serving. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a policy offering currently serving transgender troops the option to volunteer to leave with a one-time separation payout or be involuntarily separated later. Transgender troops have described the separation process as dehumanizing and cruel. Shannon Leary, a lawyer representing LGBTQ+ individuals, expects lawsuits to challenge this decision, calling it arbitrary and cruel. Logan Ireland, a master sergeant impacted by the policy, expressed feeling betrayed and devastated. As of December 9, 2024, there were 4,240 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria on active duty, National Guard, and Reserve. The Pentagon plans to use commanders and annual medical screenings to identify any transgender service members who do not come forward.
