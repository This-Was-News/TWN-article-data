## Article summary
NJ Transit is maintaining its statewide bus operations as usual during the ongoing strike, but supplemental chartered bus service will not commence until Monday, May 19. The agency's contingency plan includes private buses running from four designated Park & Ride lots to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan and PATH train stations in North Jersey. The chartered services will operate on a first-come-first-served basis during peak weekday hours. Routes include services from Secaucus Junction, PNC Bank Arts Center, Hamilton Rail Station, and Woodbridge Center Mall, each with specific schedules. NJ Transit’s CEO, Kris Kolluri, has indicated that these chartered buses can only accommodate about 20% of the displaced train riders. Free parking is available at Woodbridge Center Mall and PNC Bank Arts Center for those using the charter service. Commuters with NJ Transit rail tickets and passes can use them on the Park & Ride service and on NJ Transit buses and light rail, but not on other carriers. Some commuters may also consider switching to existing NJ Transit bus routes or private carriers like Boxcar for travel into New York. This contingency plan mirrors the one implemented during the last transit strike in New Jersey 42 years ago.
