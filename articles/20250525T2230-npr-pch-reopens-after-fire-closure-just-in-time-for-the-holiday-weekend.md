## Article summary
The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) has reopened after being closed due to the Palisades Fire, just in time for Memorial Day weekend. The fire, which occurred in January, killed 12 people and burned over 23,000 acres, isolating Malibu from visitors. Surfers and locals expressed mixed emotions about the reopening, with some celebrating the return of beach access while others worried about increased traffic from curious onlookers. The cleanup has progressed, with over 60% of debris cleared, but remnants of destruction remain visible along the highway. Business owners in Malibu hope that the reopening will revitalize the local economy, which suffered significantly during the closures. Some residents are cautious, fearing that increased traffic may not benefit the community. Despite the challenges, many locals remain hopeful for a bustling summer season as visitors return. The sentiment is one of resilience, as the community begins to heal from the recent tragedies. Emma Carroll, a local bookstore supervisor, emphasized the need for foot traffic to recover from financial losses. Overall, the reopening signifies a step toward recovery for Malibu.
