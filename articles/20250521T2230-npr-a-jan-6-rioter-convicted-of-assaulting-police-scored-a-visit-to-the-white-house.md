## Article summary
Two men, Shane Jenkins and Dominic Box, who were convicted for their involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, visited the White House months after receiving pardons from President Trump. Jenkins, sentenced to seven years for assaulting police, expressed gratitude to Trump during the visit, while both men recorded videos in the press briefing room. Box, convicted of felony civil disorder, had his case dismissed before sentencing but faced a DUI arrest in 2023. The visit, arranged through an unnamed individual from the Trump administration, raised questions as it occurred outside regular public tour hours. Both men claimed they were screened by the Secret Service, which stated they followed standard protocols. Jenkins, who has a lengthy criminal history, maintained that his actions on January 6 were justified as a response to what he believed was a stolen election. Box denied being racist despite allegations related to his DUI arrest. Jenkins and Box's visit highlights the ongoing support many Jan. 6 defendants receive from Trump, who refers to them as "political prisoners." The White House did not comment on their visit, and Trump's interactions with such individuals continue to spark controversy.
