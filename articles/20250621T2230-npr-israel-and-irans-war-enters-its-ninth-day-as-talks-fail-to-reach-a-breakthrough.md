## Article summary
The conflict between Israel and Iran has entered its ninth day, characterized by ongoing missile exchanges and failed diplomatic efforts. Iran claims that Israel launched attacks on four cities, including Isfahan, targeting nuclear facilities, while Israel confirms its strikes aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iranian officials reported casualties, including five members of the Revolutionary Guard, and warned against U.S. military involvement, deeming it dangerous. Despite diplomatic meetings in Geneva, New York, and Istanbul, no breakthroughs were achieved, with Iran's Foreign Minister asserting that negotiations with the U.S. would not occur while Israel continues its attacks. The human toll has escalated, with Iranian authorities reporting 430 civilian deaths and over 3,000 injuries, while independent sources suggest the total fatalities could be as high as 722. In Israel, retaliatory strikes have resulted in 24 deaths and over 1,000 injuries. Iranian missiles targeted the port city of Haifa, causing no significant damage. President Trump is considering military action against Iran, with a decision expected within two weeks. Meanwhile, discussions among Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation members are ongoing regarding the conflict's implications.
