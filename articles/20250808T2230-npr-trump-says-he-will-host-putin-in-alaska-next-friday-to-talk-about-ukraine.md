## Article summary
President Trump announced a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15, 2025, to discuss ending Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting follows a complex relationship between the two leaders and Trump's shifting stance on pressuring Putin. Trump hinted at a territorial exchange deal but did not provide details. The meeting comes after months of escalated strikes by Russia against Ukraine and Trump's recent threats of tougher sanctions on Moscow. Trump's envoy, Steve Wtkoff, met with Putin on August 6, and Trump expressed optimism about progress. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of stalling while continuing to advance in Eastern Ukraine. Ukraine has also conducted surprise drone strikes deep into Russia. Previous peace talks in Turkey in May were hindered by Putin's absence. Trump believes a direct meeting with Putin is necessary to resolve the conflict and reduce casualties.
