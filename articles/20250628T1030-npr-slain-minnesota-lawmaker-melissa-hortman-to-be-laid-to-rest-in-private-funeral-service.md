## Article summary
Melissa Hortman, a former Democratic speaker of the Minnesota House, and her husband, Mark, were tragically killed in a politically motivated attack at their Brooklyn Park home. A private funeral service is set for Saturday, which will be livestreamed for the public. The couple's family dog, Gilbert, was also severely injured in the incident and later euthanized. The suspected shooter, Vance Boelter, has been charged with their murders and is currently in federal custody. 

In a related attack, Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife were shot but survived. The violence against political figures reflects a troubling trend in the U.S., where threats against lawmakers have increased amid rising political polarization. Following the tragedy, the couple's children encouraged the community to honor their parents by engaging in acts of kindness. The Hortmans were laid in state at the Minnesota Capitol for public mourning before the funeral. This incident adds to a series of violent acts against political leaders in recent years, highlighting the dangers faced by those in public service.
