## Article summary
Many Trump voters are now advocating for government intervention to address high health care costs and medical debt, a significant shift from previous Republican stances. Polls indicate that these voters support federal limits on prices charged by drug companies and hospitals, as well as caps on out-of-pocket expenses for patients. Individuals like Jason Rouse, a retired firefighter, express frustration over the rising costs and seek government regulation to alleviate financial burdens. Despite a longstanding Republican skepticism towards government involvement in health care, recent polling shows a growing consensus among GOP voters for reforms to curb medical expenses.

Voters increasingly blame health insurers and drug companies for high costs rather than the government, indicating a willingness to accept more regulation. Many Trump supporters, such as Sarah Bognaski, who relies on insulin for diabetes, call for more oversight to prevent profiteering in the health care industry. While some Republican leaders remain focused on cutting government spending, there is a disconnect between their priorities and the concerns of their constituents. As the Trump administration shapes its health care agenda, the demand for government action on health care costs may influence future policy decisions.
