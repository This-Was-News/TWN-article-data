## Article summary
The New York Times outlines the personnel and objectives of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a group initiated by Elon Musk to reform federal agencies. Comprising 45 individuals, many of whom are software engineers with minimal formal Washington experience, the team aims to "shrink and disrupt" the federal government. Key leaders include Musk's longtime aide Steve Davis and health care entrepreneur Brad Smith, with Amy Gleason serving as the acting administrator. The staffers' backgrounds span various fields, including engineering, law, and finance, and they are embedded within specific government agencies.

Musk's influence extends to more than 20 federal agencies, with operations largely shielded from public scrutiny due to their relocation to the White House under President Trump's executive order. The document highlights the team's connections to Musk's companies, revealing that many staffers have previously worked for entities like SpaceX and Tesla. The initiative has faced challenges, including internal resistance and personnel controversies, but it continues to push for significant changes within the government. Overall, the extent of DOGE's reach and its long-term ambitions remain largely unclear.
