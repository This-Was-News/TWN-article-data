## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV celebrated his first Mass as pontiff in the Sistine Chapel, emphasizing missionary outreach and the need to address a loss of faith that contributes to human dignity violations. Born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago, he is the first American-born pope, having spent significant time as a bishop in Peru, where he gained citizenship. His election has sparked excitement in both the U.S. and Peru, reflecting his dual heritage. In his homily, he echoed the teachings of Pope Francis and highlighted the importance of faith in combating societal issues. The new pope's choice of name, Leo XIV, is a deliberate nod to Pope Leo XIII, known for advocating workers' rights and engaging with modern societal challenges. Pope Leo XIV is expected to maintain a pastoral approach, focusing on the vulnerable while navigating the complexities of the church's direction. His background includes Creole roots from New Orleans, adding a layer of diversity to his identity. As he begins his papacy, he will soon address the public and meet with journalists, marking the start of his leadership. The new pope's style is anticipated to be less flamboyant than his predecessor, yet he is not expected to shy away from important issues, particularly those affecting marginalized communities.
