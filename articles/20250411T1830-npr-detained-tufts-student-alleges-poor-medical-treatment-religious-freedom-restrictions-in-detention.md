## Article summary
A Tufts University international student, Rümeysa Öztürk, is currently detained in a Louisiana facility, alleging poor medical treatment and violations of her religious freedoms. Öztürk was apprehended by plainclothes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on March 25 while on her way to break her Ramadan fast. She expressed fear during her detention, believing the officers intended to harm her. Since her incarceration, she has suffered multiple asthma attacks and claims inadequate medical care, including being denied necessary medication and appropriate treatment.

Öztürk also reported civil rights violations related to her Muslim faith, including an incident where her hijab was forcibly removed by medical staff. Her attorney from the ACLU of Massachusetts emphasized concerns for her health and safety, advocating for her release. The conditions in the detention center have been described as unsanitary, with insufficient hygiene supplies and overcrowding. Advocates highlight that her treatment is not uncommon within the ICE system, particularly for Muslim detainees. Öztürk's case has been transferred to the District of Vermont, where a hearing may determine her future in ICE custody.
