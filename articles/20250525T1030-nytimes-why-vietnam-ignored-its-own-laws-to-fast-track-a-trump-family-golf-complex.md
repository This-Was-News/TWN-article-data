## Article summary
Vietnam is fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf complex near Hanoi, despite ignoring its own laws and regulations. Local residents, such as Le Van Truong, express concerns about losing ancestral land and livelihoods due to the project, which prioritizes the interests of the Trump family over community rights. Vietnamese officials have granted special concessions to facilitate the development, citing the need for support from the Trump administration amid high-stakes trade negotiations. Eric Trump, who was present at the groundbreaking ceremony, insists the project is separate from presidential duties, although financial ties remain. The rapid approval process, typically taking years, was expedited to align with the Trump family's schedule, raising ethical concerns among legal experts. The project is seen as a means for Vietnam to strengthen ties with the U.S. and showcase national pride through association with the Trump brand. However, many locals fear the implications of such political favoritism, which may undermine efforts for a more transparent business environment. As construction progresses, residents worry about the future of their land and livelihoods. The situation highlights the blurred lines between political and business interests in Vietnam, with potential risks for U.S.-Vietnam relations.
