## Article summary
Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for California governor in 2026, clearing the way for other prominent Democrats already in the race. Her decision allows other candidates to advance their campaigns without her significant influence on fundraising and name recognition. Notable Democratic candidates include former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Harris's decision also leaves the door open for a potential presidential bid in 2028. The Democratic field is strong, and any Republican candidate faces an uphill battle in a state that has not elected a Republican to statewide office since 2006.
