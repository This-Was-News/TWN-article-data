## Article summary
The article discusses a recent interaction between President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Brian Glenn, a correspondent for the conservative outlet Real Americas Voice, during a meeting with President Trump. Glenn questioned Zelensky about his choice of attire, specifically why he does not wear a suit, suggesting that his casual clothing disrespects the office he occupies. This inquiry was part of a broader narrative, as Glenn's outlet gained access to the White House press pool, a privilege previously unavailable to them. Critics quickly condemned Glenn's remarks, pointing out the inconsistency of dress standards, citing instances of other public figures, like Elon Musk, wearing casual attire in formal settings. 

Zelensky has consistently opted for military fatigues to show solidarity with Ukraine's armed forces amidst the ongoing war, a choice that has garnered international support. In response to backlash over his comments, Glenn expressed empathy for the Ukrainian people while continuing to criticize Zelensky's clothing choices. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is dating Glenn, praised his questioning of Zelensky, framing it as a necessary challenge to perceived disrespect. The article highlights the evolving dynamics of media access to the White House and the contentious discourse surrounding Zelensky's image and attire during critical diplomatic engagements.
