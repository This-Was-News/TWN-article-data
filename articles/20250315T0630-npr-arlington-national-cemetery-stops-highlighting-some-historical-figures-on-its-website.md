## Article summary
Arlington National Cemetery has started to remove from its website the histories of Black, Hispanic, and women veterans, aligning with a directive from the Trump administration to eliminate references supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within federal government communications. This initiative, described by Pentagon officials as a "digital content refresh," involves the removal of articles, photos, and videos that promote DEI narratives. Notable figures such as General Colin Powell and the 8666 Postal Corps, which comprised only Black women during World War II, will no longer be prominently featured, although their stories remain accessible through the search function. Additionally, thousands of images representing diverse veterans are also being marked for removal. This decision has sparked discussions about the implications for historical representation and the commemoration of contributions made by underrepresented groups in the military. The changes reflect a broader trend within federal agencies to revise how diversity is portrayed in public-facing materials.
