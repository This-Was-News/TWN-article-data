## Article summary
In a recent NBC News interview, President Trump stated that he would not rule out the use of military force to acquire Greenland, following Vice President JD Vance's scaled-back visit to the island. Trump's comments sparked criticism from Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who emphasized that Denmark is already investing in Arctic security and expressed discontent with the tone of the U.S. administration's remarks. Trump asserted that while he believes a peaceful acquisition is possible, he does not dismiss military options. He also indicated indifference to the potential implications of his stance on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vance, during his visit, criticized Denmark for underinvesting in Greenland's security and suggested that the island would be better off as part of the United States. The Danish Prime Minister defended her country’s commitment to Arctic defense, while Greenland's parliament expressed strong opposition to U.S. annexation efforts. Public protests erupted in Denmark against the U.S. approach, reflecting widespread discontent among Greenlanders and Danes alike. Additionally, Denmark recently announced significant investments in Arctic security, reinforcing its commitment to the region.
