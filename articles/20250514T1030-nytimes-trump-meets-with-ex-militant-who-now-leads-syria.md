## Article summary
President Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara in Riyadh, marking the first meeting between U.S. and Syrian leaders in 25 years, following Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria. This meeting symbolizes a significant shift in U.S. policy, as al-Shara's administration seeks to stabilize the country after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. During their half-hour discussion, Trump encouraged al-Shara to normalize relations with Israel and expel foreign terrorists from Syria. The meeting was part of Trump's Gulf tour, which also focused on business deals, including defense and AI infrastructure. 

Trump's relationship with Gulf leaders has strengthened, as he has provided support without criticizing their human rights records. The visit coincided with ongoing violence in Gaza, with reports of numerous casualties from Israeli airstrikes. Meanwhile, discussions about a potential deal regarding Iran's nuclear program were highlighted by Oman's deputy prime minister. 

The meeting with al-Shara is seen as an opportunity for a historic change in Syria's international standing. Additionally, FIFA President Gianni Infantino joined Trump on his tour, emphasizing their close relationship as the U.S. prepares to co-host the World Cup in 2026.
