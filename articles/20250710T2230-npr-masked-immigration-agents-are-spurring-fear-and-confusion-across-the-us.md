## Article summary
The article discusses the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, particularly the use of masked and unmarked federal agents, which has sparked fear and confusion. These agents, including ICE and other federal officers, often wear plainclothes and arrive in unmarked vehicles, leading to concerns about their identification and accountability. Critics argue that this approach undermines public trust and creates a climate of fear, while DHS officials claim it's for the agents' safety. The article highlights specific incidents, such as the arrest of Job Garcia, a U.S. citizen who was detained for over 24 hours after filming an immigration arrest. Garcia and his legal representatives allege racial profiling and unlawful conduct, while DHS disputes these claims. The article also mentions legislation introduced to ban federal immigration agents from wearing masks during arrests and concerns about potential abuse and violence stemming from these tactics.
