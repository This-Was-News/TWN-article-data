## Article summary
The article discusses Xi Jinping's strategic response to the trade conflict initiated by the Trump administration, which he has been preparing for since 2020. Instead of conforming to U.S. demands, Xi chose to strengthen China's dominance in global supply chains, aiming to make the world reliant on Chinese goods. This aggressive stance has involved ramping up exports, implementing economic warfare tactics, and tightening international production chains. As the trade war escalates, the U.S. faces pressures from rising consumer prices and potential shortages due to China's export restrictions on critical minerals. Despite ongoing talks to ease tensions, the U.S.-China rivalry is intensifying, particularly in technology sectors like artificial intelligence. Xi's approach reflects his belief that China is no longer weaker than the U.S., and he has positioned himself as a transformative leader aiming to restore China's historical glory. However, the long-term effectiveness of this strategy is questioned, as it risks alienating trading partners and could lead to economic challenges domestically. Critics argue that a more open economy could benefit China's growth, but Xi's focus on state control may hinder this. The article concludes by highlighting the deteriorating global environment for China, which could complicate its ambitions for superpower status.
