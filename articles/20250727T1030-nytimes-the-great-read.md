## Article summary
The article describes the devastating impact of an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods, a Nebraska meatpacking company, where nearly 70% of production was lost after 107 workers were arrested for being undocumented immigrants. The raid left the company struggling to rebuild its workforce, with many employees facing deportation and families torn apart. The owners, who had used the E-Verify system to check employee eligibility, expressed frustration with the system's limitations and the government's handling of the situation. The article highlights the human cost of the raid, including the trauma experienced by the workers and their families, as well as the challenges faced by the company in finding new employees. Despite the setbacks, the company is trying to rebuild, but the ripple effects of the raid continue to be felt by both the workers and the community.
