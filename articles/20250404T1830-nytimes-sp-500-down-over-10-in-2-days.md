## Article summary
The S&P 500 experienced a significant decline of over 10% in just two days, marking one of Wall Street's worst weeks since the pandemic, largely due to President Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite index fell into bear market territory, exacerbated by China's retaliation with 34% tariffs on U.S. goods, including agricultural products. Despite a strong U.S. jobs report indicating the addition of 228,000 jobs, concerns about a trade war overshadowed positive economic indicators. Analysts warned that the tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressing caution about the economic outlook. Some Republican senators, including Ted Cruz, voiced their unease about the tariffs, highlighting the potential negative impact on American consumers and jobs. The agricultural sector braced for significant losses, with soybean farmers expected to lose billions due to increased tariffs. Additionally, companies like Nintendo postponed U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 to assess the tariffs' impact. As the trade tensions escalated, California's Governor Gavin Newsom sought to negotiate trade deals to protect local products from retaliation. Overall, the situation underscored the deepening economic uncertainties stemming from the ongoing trade conflict.
