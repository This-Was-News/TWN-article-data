## Article summary
Steve Witkoff, President Trump's envoy, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the fifth time this year to discuss potential U.S. sanctions against Russia. The meeting, described by Trump as pivotal, took place amid looming sanctions and ongoing Russian advances in Ukraine. Witkoff, a long-time friend of Trump, has had extraordinary access to Putin, facilitating prisoner exchanges and calls between the two leaders, but no clear progress on ending the war in Ukraine. Trump has recently soured on Putin publicly, while Putin has engaged with Trump without compromising on his goals in Ukraine. The U.S. is considering sanctions on countries like China that buy Russian energy, with the outcome of Witkoff's meeting expected to determine the next steps.
