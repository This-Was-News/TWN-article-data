## Article summary
The U.S. government will require some foreign visitors to pay bonds of up to $15,000 to enter the country, targeting tourists and business visitors from nations with high visa overstay rates. This initiative, announced by the State Department, aims to ensure visitors comply with their visa terms, with bonds forfeited if they overstay. The program, set to begin on August 20, will apply to visitors from countries with insufficient screening and vetting information, as well as those granted citizenship through investment without residency requirements. The bonds, ranging from $5,000 to $15,000, will be determined by consular officers and refunded if visitors adhere to their visa conditions. This pilot program is part of a broader effort to address illegal immigration and visa overstays, which the administration views as a significant national security threat.
