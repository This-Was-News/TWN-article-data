## Article summary
The article discusses the pursuit of critical minerals by Presidents Trump and Biden, highlighting their significance in U.S. foreign policy amid competition with China. Trump's aggressive tactics to secure Ukraine's mineral resources have raised concerns, with critics likening his approach to extortion. His interest in these minerals dates back to 2017, and he has also expressed ambitions regarding Greenland and Canada. A recent agreement was reached between the U.S. and Ukraine regarding mineral revenue sharing, though Trump's demands have been criticized as colonial and mercantilist.

Biden's administration has taken a more collaborative approach, focusing on building partnerships with mineral-rich countries rather than coercive tactics. Both administrations recognize the importance of critical minerals for energy technologies and national security, especially given China's dominance in this area. The U.S. imports a significant portion of its critical minerals, which has prompted efforts to diversify supply chains. The negotiations surrounding these resources are sensitive, as countries value their mineral wealth for economic development and sovereignty. Ultimately, the article underscores the geopolitical implications of mineral extraction and the differing strategies of the two administrations in addressing these challenges.
