## Article summary
The White House has taken down the website for the National Climate Assessment, which serves as a crucial resource detailing the impacts of climate change across the United States. This comprehensive report is widely utilized by educators, city planners, and the public for information on issues like rising sea levels and wildfire smoke exposure. The Trump administration had previously halted the development of the next edition of the report and dismissed the staff involved. Despite the website's removal, the most recent edition can still be accessed through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA's upcoming site. However, the NOAA archive lacks the search functionality of the original site. An archived, searchable version is available via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The interactive atlas, which allows users to explore climate effects in specific locations, remains accessible through Esri's website. The next edition of the assessment, originally scheduled for 2027, has been stalled due to the loss of federal coordination staff. Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe emphasized the report's importance in connecting the dots regarding climate change impacts on everyday life.
