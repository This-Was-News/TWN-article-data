## Article summary
Catholic leaders are criticizing President Trump for posting an apparent AI-generated image of himself dressed as the pope on social media. The image was shared on Truth Social and later reposted by the White House. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, expressed hope that Trump was not involved in creating the image, stating that "it wasn't good." The New York State Catholic Conference condemned the image as disrespectful, especially following the recent death of Pope Francis and the upcoming papal conclave. Bishop Thomas John Paprocki added that the image was "deeply offensive" and called for an apology from Trump. In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted Trump's respect for Pope Francis and his support for Catholics. Vice President JD Vance defended humor in general but criticized the timing of the image. Trump had previously joked about wanting to be pope, which adds to the controversy surrounding the AI image. The incident has sparked a significant backlash from the Catholic community.
