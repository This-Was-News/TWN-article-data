## Article summary
The article discusses the urgent need for negotiations between the U.S. and Iran following recent military strikes by the U.S. on Iranian nuclear facilities, which President Trump claimed had "obliterated" key components of Iran's nuclear program. Despite these assertions, experts warn that military action alone will not deter Iran's nuclear ambitions and could instead accelerate them. Analysts emphasize the importance of a political strategy and formal negotiations to prevent a potential resumption of conflict. The ceasefire between Israel and Iran, while currently in place, is viewed as precarious without a clear framework for dialogue. 

Experts, including former Pentagon officials, stress that immediate negotiations are critical, as Iran may already be advancing its nuclear capabilities in response to recent hostilities. The complexities of the nuclear issue and entrenched positions on both sides pose significant challenges for any forthcoming talks. The article also highlights the difficulties in negotiating without international oversight of Iran's nuclear activities, complicating the potential for a sustainable agreement. Ultimately, the success of any negotiations will depend on the diplomats' ability to effectively engage and address technical concerns surrounding Iran's nuclear program.
