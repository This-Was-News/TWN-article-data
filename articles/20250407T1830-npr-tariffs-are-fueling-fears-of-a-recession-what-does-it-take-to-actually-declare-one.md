## Article summary
The article discusses the potential for a recession fueled by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which have raised concerns among consumers and economists. Following the announcement of these tariffs, major banks, including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, increased their forecasts for the likelihood of a recession, citing a rise in inflation and consumer spending declines. A recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity lasting more than a few months, typically assessed by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which is responsible for officially declaring recessions. The NBER's criteria include two consecutive quarters of declining GDP, although their assessments can take several months to finalize.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has downplayed recession fears, emphasizing the importance of long-term economic fundamentals. Nevertheless, consumer confidence appears to be waning, with potential layoffs looming if businesses experience reduced sales. Historically, the U.S. has faced 34 recessions since 1857, with varying lengths, and the average post-World War II recession lasting about 11.1 months. The article highlights the interconnectedness of economic factors, suggesting that decreased consumer spending can lead to further economic deterioration. Overall, the situation remains fluid, with ongoing debates about the impact of tariffs on the economy.
