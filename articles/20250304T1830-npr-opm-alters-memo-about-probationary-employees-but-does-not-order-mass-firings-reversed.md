## Article summary
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has revised a memo from January 20 that asked federal agencies to identify probationary employees for potential mass firings, but it did not reverse the terminations of those employees. The updated memo clarifies that OPM is not directing agencies to take specific actions regarding these employees, asserting that agencies retain ultimate decision-making authority. This revision comes in response to a recent court ruling that indicated OPM may have violated multiple statutes by ordering such firings. The American Federation of Government Employees has called for the reinstatement of those terminated, labeling the firings unlawful. 

Additionally, the revised memo modifies language about how probationary periods should be assessed, emphasizing that performance evaluations must align with the government's best interests and current needs. A federal judge had previously ruled that OPM lacked the authority to mandate employee terminations, leading to further scrutiny of the memo's implications. Another hearing on the case is scheduled for March 13, as discussions continue regarding the legality and process of these firings. The National Science Foundation has already reinstated some of its terminated probationary employees based on updated guidance from OPM and federal courts.
