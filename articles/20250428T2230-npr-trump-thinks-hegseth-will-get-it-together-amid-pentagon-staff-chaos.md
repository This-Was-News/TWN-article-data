## Article summary
Former President Donald Trump expressed confidence that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will manage the ongoing chaos at the Pentagon, following reports of his mishandling of classified information and a shake-up among his staff. In an interview, Trump characterized his conversation with Hegseth as positive, despite concerns from former aides about a toxic work environment. Colin Carroll, a former senior staffer, highlighted a "culture of fear" in Hegseth's office, with allegations of staff being fired for purportedly leaking information. Trump's National Security Adviser defended Hegseth, dismissing claims of dysfunction as a media narrative.

The Pentagon has announced new senior appointments, but many of the individuals lack significant experience, raising questions about their qualifications. Some Democrats are calling for Hegseth's resignation, citing his inexperience and the chaos he has allegedly created. Hegseth, a former Fox News host with limited government experience, has faced scrutiny for his management style and actions, including firing senior military officials. Concerns persist about the Pentagon's readiness in a crisis, as former staff members worry that ongoing disruptions could hinder important defense initiatives.
