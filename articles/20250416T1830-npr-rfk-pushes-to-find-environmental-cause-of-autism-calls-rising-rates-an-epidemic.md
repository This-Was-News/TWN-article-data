## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services Secretary, has labeled the rising incidence of autism in the U.S. as an "epidemic," attributing it to unidentified environmental toxins. He highlighted a significant increase in autism rates from 1 in 36 children in 2020 to 1 in 31 in 2022, as reported by the CDC. Kennedy aims to shift research focus from genetic causes, which he deems a "dead end," to environmental factors, promising new studies to identify these toxins within weeks. However, experts have criticized this approach, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of autism's causes, which include genetic, biological, and environmental influences.

Many advocates argue that Kennedy's claims are not grounded in established science and could perpetuate stigma against autistic individuals. They stress the importance of supporting families and individuals with autism rather than focusing solely on causation. The CDC report suggests that improved screening may contribute to higher prevalence rates, rather than an actual increase in cases. Critics of Kennedy's rhetoric argue that it undermines the dignity of autistic individuals and distracts from essential support services. Overall, the debate continues about the appropriate focus for autism research and advocacy.
