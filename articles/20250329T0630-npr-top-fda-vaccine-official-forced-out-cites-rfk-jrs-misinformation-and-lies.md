## Article summary
Dr. Peter Marks, a prominent vaccine official at the FDA, has resigned, citing a lack of truth and transparency from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his resignation letter, Marks criticized Kennedy for promoting misinformation and lies regarding vaccines. His departure raises concerns among public health experts, especially as Kennedy has previously questioned vaccine safety and effectiveness. Marks, known for his role in the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines during Operation Warp Speed, expressed disappointment over the agency's direction under Kennedy's leadership.

In his letter, Marks warned about the adverse health effects of vaccination misinformation, highlighting an ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, which has seen at least 400 cases. He emphasized the importance of maintaining confidence in established vaccines and criticized efforts that undermine public trust in vaccine safety. Marks stated he hoped for an end to the "unprecedented assault on scientific truth" to benefit public health. His resignation reflects broader concerns within the scientific community about the future of vaccine regulation and public health policy under the current administration.
