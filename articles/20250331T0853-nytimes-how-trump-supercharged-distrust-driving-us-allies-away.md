## Article summary
The article discusses how President Trump's actions and rhetoric have fostered distrust among U.S. allies, leading them to reconsider their relationships with the United States. His remarks about downgrading military technology for allies and threats to their economies have confirmed fears that America can no longer be relied upon. Countries like Canada, which once trusted the U.S., are now seeking alternatives, evidenced by significant defense and trade agreements with other nations. The article highlights examples of distancing, such as Canada’s military collaborations with Australia and the EU's accelerated negotiations with India. Similarly, nations like Japan and Brazil are exploring new markets and trade avenues to reduce reliance on the U.S. 

The distrust spiral created by Trump's zero-sum mentality is leading allies to consider independent defense strategies, including discussions about nuclear capabilities in countries like Poland and South Korea. As Europe ramps up military spending and seeks defense collaborations, the article suggests that while some countries are taking steps toward diversification, it will take years to rebuild trust. Overall, the piece portrays a shift toward a less U.S.-centric world order, driven by growing skepticism of American intentions.
