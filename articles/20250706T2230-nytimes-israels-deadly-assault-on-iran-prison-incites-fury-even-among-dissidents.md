## Article summary
Israel's missile strike on Evin prison in Tehran on June 23, 2025, resulted in widespread condemnation, even from dissidents, due to the high civilian casualties, including family members and staff present during the attack. Evin prison, notorious for its brutal treatment of political prisoners, has long symbolized oppression in Iran. The assault killed at least 79 people, including a 5-year-old child and numerous social workers and lawyers, with many others reported missing. Human rights activists, including Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, condemned the attack as a war crime. Inmates described the chaos during the strikes, with buildings collapsing and security forces later forcing prisoners to evacuate under duress. Reports indicate that conditions worsened for those transferred to other facilities, with claims that Evin prison may be closed permanently. Amnesty International and the UN have called for accountability and immediate action to protect political prisoners. The Israeli government characterized the attack as a symbolic act, but many in Iran view it as a disregard for human life. The aftermath saw significant destruction and trauma among the surviving inmates and their families. Overall, the event highlighted the ongoing struggle between oppressive regimes and foreign military actions, leaving prisoners caught in a tragic crossfire.
