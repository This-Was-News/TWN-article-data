## Article summary
A senior Federal Reserve official, Michelle Bowman, has stated that the recent weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report strengthens her belief that interest rates should be lowered. Bowman, who voted for a rate cut last week, argues for three rate cuts this year, aligning with the Fed's remaining meetings in 2025. The jobs report indicated significantly lower hiring than expected, reinforcing her stance. Bowman also expressed growing confidence that President Donald Trump's tariffs will not cause persistent inflation, seeing it moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. The Fed's challenge lies in balancing a strong job market with controlling inflation using interest rates. There are concerns that Trump's tariffs could lead to stagflation, a scenario the Fed is ill-equipped to handle. Wall Street anticipates a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in September due to the disappointing jobs report. Trump has been vocal in demanding lower interest rates, even personally criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. With a recent vacancy on the Fed's board, Trump has the opportunity to appoint another governor. The Fed has maintained steady interest rates throughout the year, awaiting more data on the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation.
