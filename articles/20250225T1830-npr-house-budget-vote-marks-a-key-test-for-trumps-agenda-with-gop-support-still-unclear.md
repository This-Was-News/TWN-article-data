## Article summary
The House budget vote represents a critical moment for Trump's domestic agenda, as GOP leaders work to secure party support for a multitrillion-dollar plan addressing defense, energy, immigration, and tax policy. With a vote imminent, internal divisions among Republicans pose challenges, particularly regarding spending cuts and support for Medicaid. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed optimism about progress despite the complexities of negotiations. The proposed budget includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit, aiming to renew the 2017 Trump tax cuts. However, the plan has faced pushback from fiscal conservatives seeking deeper spending cuts, leading to concerns over potential impacts on social safety net programs. Some Republicans have indicated opposition, voicing worries that the budget could worsen the deficit. If the House fails to pass its plan, the Senate's alternative may become the fallback option, which would break down Trump's agenda into two separate bills. Overall, the outcome of the vote is crucial for the Republican Party's legislative strategy moving forward.
