## Article summary
"Buildup to a Meltdown: How the Trump-Musk Alliance Collapsed" details the unraveling relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk, sparked by Trump's discovery of donations made by Musk's nominee for NASA, Jared Isaacman, to prominent Democrats. Although Musk attempted to defend Isaacman, Trump’s disappointment led to Isaacman’s nomination being withdrawn, which Musk found humiliating. The tension escalated as Musk publicly criticized a Republican bill favored by Trump, expressing concerns over its impact on the federal deficit. The alliance officially fractured when Trump expressed disappointment in Musk during a meeting, leading Musk to retaliate with attacks on social media. Trump threatened to cut federal contracts with Musk's companies, while Musk hinted at a potential reconciliation. Blame for the fallout was attributed to Sergio Gor, a White House personnel director, though some defended him, stating the decision ultimately rested with Trump. The document illustrates how quickly political alliances can dissolve under pressure and differing priorities.
