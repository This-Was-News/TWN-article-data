## Article summary
The GOP's recently passed tax cut and spending bill is projected to significantly increase the federal debt by trillions over the next decade. Estimates vary, with the Yale Budget Lab suggesting an addition of $3 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) at $3.4 trillion, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget indicating $4 trillion or more. Critics, including Maya MacGuineas, argue that this reflects a failure in responsible governance, as lawmakers who previously expressed concern over national debt are now contributing to its increase. The bill extends tax cuts from the Trump administration and introduces additional breaks, which are expected to decrease government revenues while increasing spending on defense and immigration. Cuts to Medicaid and food assistance only partially offset the bill's total cost. Economic growth is anticipated to be minimal, with previous analyses indicating that the modest gains would be overshadowed by higher interest payments. The wealth distribution of tax savings suggests that the richest taxpayers will benefit the most, while individuals earning under $55,000 annually are likely to be net losers due to lost government benefits. Middle-income taxpayers may see limited savings, whereas the top 10% could gain significantly. Overall, the bill raises concerns about fiscal responsibility and equity in tax benefits.
