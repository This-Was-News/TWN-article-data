## Article summary
The article discusses the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economy and the potential for a recession amid President Trump's trade wars. While some economists believe that rising tariffs will lead to reduced consumer spending and layoffs, current economic data shows no significant decline in consumer spending or increase in layoffs. Instead, economists are relying on unconventional indicators, such as customs revenue and hotel bookings, to gauge economic health as traditional data lags behind. The Federal Reserve is also grappling with how to set monetary policy amid fluctuating trade policies, awaiting clearer signs of economic shifts. Disagreement exists among economists about the impact of tariffs, with some suggesting they might lead to higher prices and reduced purchases, while others believe affluent consumers will continue to spend. The article highlights mixed signals from various sectors, with some companies reporting declining sales while others, like Yum Brands, see growth. Anecdotal evidence is being scrutinized for early indications of economic direction, but it can be misleading. The Fed will ultimately need concrete data, such as rising unemployment or slowing spending, to consider adjusting interest rates. The article underscores the complexities of the current economic landscape and the challenges faced by policymakers.
