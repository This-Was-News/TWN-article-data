## Article summary
A series of powerful storms and tornadoes swept through Kentucky and Missouri, resulting in significant destruction and loss of life. In Kentucky, the death toll has reached at least 18, with Governor Andy Beshear on-site in London, a city heavily affected by the storms. Local resident Kristen Mosley described the scene as "total devastation," with many homes and trees destroyed. In Missouri, at least seven fatalities have been reported, primarily in the St. Louis area, where over 30 individuals have been injured. St. Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson cautioned that the number of injuries could rise as responders continue their search for survivors. Mayor Cara Spencer characterized the destruction as "truly tremendous," with an estimated 5,000 buildings affected. Authorities have implemented a curfew to facilitate recovery efforts and ensure public safety amidst downed power lines. The storms have also caused widespread power outages, leaving nearly half a million customers without electricity across multiple states. The situation remains fluid, with updates expected as recovery efforts progress.
