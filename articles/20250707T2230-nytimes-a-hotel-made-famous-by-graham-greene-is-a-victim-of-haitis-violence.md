## Article summary
The Oloffson Hotel, a historic landmark in Haiti known for its distinctive gingerbread architecture and celebrity guests, was destroyed in an apparent arson fire. The hotel's owner, Richard Morse, confirmed the loss, which was captured in drone footage, highlighting the ongoing violence from gangs in Port-au-Prince. The hotel, built in the late 19th century, served as a private residence before becoming a hotel that hosted notable figures like Graham Greene, who featured it in his novel "The Comedians." Over its century-long history, the Oloffson survived political turmoil and natural disasters, including the devastating 2010 earthquake. While it was a symbol of Haiti's cultural richness, it also reflected the stark social divides within the country. Morse, who took over management in the late 1980s, maintained the hotel's vibrant atmosphere despite frequent challenges like power outages and violence. Although he mourns the hotel's destruction, Morse emphasizes that the suffering of ordinary Haitians is far more significant. The hotel had been closed to guests for over a year due to escalating violence, and Morse last visited in January. He expresses that while the loss of the Oloffson is heartbreaking, the broader context of Haiti's struggles is paramount.
