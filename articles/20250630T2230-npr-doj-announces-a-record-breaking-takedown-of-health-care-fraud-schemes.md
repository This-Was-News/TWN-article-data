## Article summary
The Justice Department has announced a historic takedown of health care fraud schemes, charging a Pakistani national, Farrukh Ali, who allegedly orchestrated a $650 million fraud targeting Arizona's Medicaid program for addiction treatment. Ali conspired with 41 substance abuse clinics to bill the state for services that were either never provided or medically unnecessary, often recruiting patients from homeless populations and Native American reservations. This year's operation marked the largest health care fraud initiative in department history, with intended losses totaling $14.6 billion and actual losses amounting to $2.9 billion. Matthew Galeotti, head of the Criminal Division, emphasized the impact of such fraud on American taxpayers. Ali's company, ProMD Solutions LLC, facilitated fraudulent billing by credentialing clinics that provided no legitimate care, while kickbacks were paid to secure patient enrollments. The fraudulent claims included falsified therapy notes to cover up the lack of actual services. Prosecutors allege that Ali and his accomplices submitted about $650 million in false claims, receiving approximately $564 million in payments. Ali reportedly used nearly $3 million from the scheme to purchase property in Dubai. This extensive fraud highlights the pervasive issue of health care fraud within the sector, which is estimated to cost around $300 billion annually.
