## Article summary
This week, President Trump described the U.S. as being in a "period of transition," raising concerns about a potential recession amid ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. His administration's approach to tariffs has caused stock market declines and heightened tensions with trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and China. A significant government shutdown was narrowly avoided when Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer agreed to support a GOP-written spending bill, despite initial resistance. In education, the Trump administration's cuts led to mass layoffs at the Department of Education, raising concerns about the agency's ability to function effectively. 

On the international front, Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire in its conflict with Russia, prompting the U.S. to resume military aid, although Russia has yet to respond positively. Additionally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now head of the Department of Health and Human Services, delivered mixed messages regarding vaccine safety amid a measles outbreak in Texas. As the administration continues to push for efficiency and budget cuts, critics worry about the broader implications for federal services and public health. Trump's comments on tariffs and the economy have sparked significant debate and uncertainty, with some administration officials suggesting that the potential for recession could be "worth it" for long-term gains. Overall, the week has been marked by a blend of contentious policy decisions and mixed messaging that has left many Americans anxious about the future.
