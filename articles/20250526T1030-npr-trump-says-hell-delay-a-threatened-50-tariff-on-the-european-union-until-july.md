## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced a delay in the implementation of a threatened 50% tariff on European Union goods, pushing the start date from June 1 to July 9. This decision followed a phone call with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, who expressed a desire to engage in serious negotiations. Trump indicated that he had been vocal about the need for the EU to negotiate more effectively, as he felt discussions had stalled. The tariffs were initially proposed due to frustrations with the EU's trade practices. Following the call, Trump stated that he was pleased to extend the deadline for tariffs, highlighting the importance of finding a resolution. Von der Leyen affirmed the significance of the U.S.-EU trade relationship and expressed readiness to advance negotiations swiftly. The extension until July 9 is intended to allow both parties time to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Overall, the situation reflects ongoing tensions in transatlantic trade relations, but the delay offers a temporary reprieve for discussions.
