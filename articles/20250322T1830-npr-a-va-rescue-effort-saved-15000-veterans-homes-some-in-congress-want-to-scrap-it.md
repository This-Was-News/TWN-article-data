## Article summary
A recent NPR investigation highlighted a VA rescue effort that has saved 15,000 veterans' homes after a blunder in the VA home loan program left around 40,000 veterans at risk of foreclosure. This situation arose when the VA abruptly ended a crucial part of a pandemic-era mortgage relief program, causing financial distress for many veterans like Kevin Conlon, who faced the possibility of losing their homes. The new VA Servicing Purchase program (VASP) has been instrumental in helping veterans recover from the crisis, but some members of Congress are pushing to eliminate it, fearing it poses a risk to the broader VA home loan program.

Critics argue that capping the VASP program at 250 loans per year would effectively cripple it, leading to unnecessary foreclosures among veterans still struggling with their mortgages. Industry groups and housing advocates warn that scrapping the program without a viable alternative would result in significant harm to veterans. Kevin Conlon expressed his concern that losing the VASP program would jeopardize his family's home, emphasizing the program's importance for their stability. As Congress debates the future of VASP, many veterans are anxiously hoping for continued support to avoid foreclosure.
