## Article summary
The investigation by NPR highlights the plight of Syrian children who were taken to orphanages during the Assad regime, particularly those whose mothers were detained. Many children, referred to as "security placement" kids, were forcibly removed from their mothers in chaotic conditions and placed in orphanages while their mothers remained imprisoned. Reports suggest that over 300 children were hidden in at least four orphanages in Damascus, with some orphanage directors admitting they had no choice but to comply with orders from the regime's intelligence agencies. Families of the missing children, like Hani al-Farra, who lost his pregnant wife and three children in 2013, are reigniting their search for their loved ones after learning about the orphanages. 

While some children were eventually reunited with their mothers, many remain unaccounted for, raising concerns about their fate. The orphanage staff often struggled with the terrible conditions and malnourishment of the children upon their arrival. Efforts to trace the children have been complicated by poor record-keeping and the chaotic nature of the orphanages. As the Assad regime's hold weakened, families began to hope that their missing children might still be alive in these institutions. The emotional toll on families and the uncertainty surrounding the children's futures continue to haunt those searching for answers.
