## Article summary
The recent phone call between President Trump and President Putin marks a diplomatic win for Russia, as Putin seeks to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine while continuing military operations. Trump expressed support for direct peace talks, breaking from his earlier stance for an immediate cease-fire. However, this diplomatic progress may hinder Russia's economic goals, as Trump linked economic normalization with the resolution of the Ukraine conflict. Russian officials hope that improved relations could lead to the lifting of sanctions and a return of American businesses. Despite the ongoing war, the Russian economy is expected to grow, aided by stable oil prices and a resilient military recruitment strategy. Analysts suggest that recent Russian military gains could diminish the urgency for compromise in negotiations. The Kremlin aims to convince Trump that Russia's resources are a valuable asset, potentially overshadowing the international backlash for the ongoing conflict. While sanctions have pressured Russia, they have also reinforced a narrative of an existential struggle against the West. Overall, the situation remains complex, with Russia balancing military ambitions and economic aspirations amid ongoing diplomatic efforts.
