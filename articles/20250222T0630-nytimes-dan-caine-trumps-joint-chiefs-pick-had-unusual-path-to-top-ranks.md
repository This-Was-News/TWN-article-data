Dan Caine, a retired Air Force lieutenant general, has been nominated by President Trump to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Caine gained Trump's attention in 2018 when he confidently stated that the Islamic State could be defeated in a week, a claim that contrasted with the longer timelines suggested by senior advisers. Caine's career is notable for its unconventional trajectory, including roles as a White House fellow and a counterterrorism specialist under President George W. Bush. He has also served as an associate director for military affairs at the CIA from 2021 to 2024, focusing on classified military operations.

Educated at the Virginia Military Institute, Caine is an accomplished F-16 pilot with significant combat experience. His military background includes secretive intelligence assignments and a part-time role in the Air National Guard. Trump's recounting of their initial meeting has varied over time, with the president embellishing details about Caine's remarks and actions, including a claim that Caine wore a MAGA hat during their encounter. Overall, Caine is described by colleagues as an exceptionally talented officer, with a diverse and impactful career in military and national security roles.
