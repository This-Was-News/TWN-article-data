## Article summary
President Trump announced plans for a new missile defense system called the "Golden Dome," aimed at intercepting missiles from around the world, including those launched from space. The project is projected to cost $175 billion, with an initial $25 billion earmarked for construction in the next budget, and hopes to be completed by the end of Trump's term. The system would involve a network of satellites capable of detecting and destroying missiles shortly after launch. While experts believe the concept is theoretically feasible, they acknowledge the complexities and challenges of intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Critics, including physicist Laura Grego, warn that the system could be vulnerable to countermeasures and emphasize the need for careful scrutiny of its costs and feasibility. The potential costs of Golden Dome have been debated, with estimates ranging from $161 billion to over a trillion dollars. The project also aims to address emerging threats, such as hypersonic missiles and cruise missiles. The historical context of missile defense efforts dates back to Ronald Reagan's era, highlighting the ongoing challenges in this field. Overall, while the Golden Dome represents a bold vision for missile defense, its practicality and effectiveness remain uncertain.
