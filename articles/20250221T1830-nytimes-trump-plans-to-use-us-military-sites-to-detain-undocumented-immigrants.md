## Article summary
The Trump administration plans to detain undocumented immigrants at military sites across the United States, marking a significant escalation in immigration enforcement. A proposed deportation hub at Fort Bliss, Texas, aims to hold up to 10,000 individuals during the deportation process. This initiative seeks to address a shortage of space at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities by establishing a network of military detention centers nationwide. While previous administrations have used military bases for temporary holding, this plan would expand their use for long-term detention. Critics raise concerns about the appropriateness of military facilities for this purpose and the potential for poor conditions, citing past issues with migrant treatment. The administration's reliance on military resources comes as ICE struggles with limited detention capacity, having recently detained around 40,000 individuals. Trump officials emphasize that the use of military assets is essential for their mass deportation goals. As the plan develops, initial detentions at Fort Bliss could lead to broader use of military bases across various states. The administration's approach reflects a commitment to militarizing immigration enforcement, a central theme of Trump's presidency.
