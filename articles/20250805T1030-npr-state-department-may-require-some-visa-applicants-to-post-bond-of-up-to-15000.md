## Article summary
The State Department is proposing a new rule that would require visa applicants from certain countries to post a bond of up to $15,000. This pilot program, targeting nations with high overstay rates and poor internal document security, aims to ensure U.S. financial protection in case of visa non-compliance. The proposal is part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to tighten visa requirements, including additional in-person interviews for renewals and valid passport mandates for Diversity Lottery applicants. The bond would not apply to citizens of countries in the Visa Waiver Program, which facilitates short-term travel for business or tourism. While visa bonds have been proposed before, they have not been implemented due to procedural complexities and potential public misperceptions, though the department argues that past concerns are not supported by recent evidence.
