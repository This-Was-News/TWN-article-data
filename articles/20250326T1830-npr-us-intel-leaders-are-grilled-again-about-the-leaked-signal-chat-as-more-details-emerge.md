## Article summary
U.S. intelligence leaders faced intense scrutiny during a House Intelligence Committee hearing regarding a security breach involving a leaked Signal chat. The incident came to light when Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, revealed he was mistakenly added to a group chat where officials discussed sensitive military plans, including a bombing campaign in Yemen. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard acknowledged the mistake but asserted that no classified information was shared. However, Democrats on the committee disputed this claim, arguing that the details shared constituted classified information due to their potential impact on national security.

During the hearing, Rep. Joaquin Castro highlighted the nature of the information shared, while Gabbard maintained that the conversation was candid but did not include specific operational details. The White House downplayed the incident, suggesting the media was overemphasizing the breach. Despite the officials' insistence that they acted appropriately, the release of the Signal messages by The Atlantic prompted calls for accountability, with some lawmakers demanding the resignation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The situation underscores ongoing concerns about the use of civilian software for discussing sensitive government matters.
