## Article summary
Patients are facing a crisis as compounding pharmacies, which have been providing cheaper alternatives to Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound, must cease production due to an FDA declaration that the drug shortage has ended. This change has left many, like Christina and Jackson Agar, who have benefited from compounded tirzepatide, anxious and uncertain about their future treatment options. The Agars, who have lost weight and experienced improved health since starting the drug, are among those concerned about the abrupt halt in availability.

Some patients are scrambling to stock up on the compounded version before the deadline, while others express frustration and confusion over inconsistent information from telehealth companies. The FDA's policy shift means that only large outsourcing facilities can continue to produce tirzepatide, and even then, supplies may not last long. Many patients, like Margot Carmichael, are resorting to borrowing money to stockpile their medications, as the official Zepbound vials remain prohibitively expensive without insurance.

As a result, some patients are discussing risky alternatives, such as sourcing active ingredients from abroad to create their own versions of the drug, despite the dangers involved. Overall, the situation highlights the challenges patients face in accessing affordable obesity treatment amid regulatory changes.
