## Article summary
The article discusses how President Trump's massive tax-and-spending bill could provide an opportunity for Democrats in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the bill for its significant cuts to Medicaid, labeling it as the largest healthcare cut in American history. Trump, in contrast, is promoting the bill as a catalyst for economic growth, signaling plans to campaign on its behalf. Despite some support for specific provisions, polls indicate that more people oppose the bill than support it, particularly due to the potential impact on Medicaid, which is widely favored among the public.

The article highlights a disconnect between public perception and reality regarding Medicaid, with many incorrectly believing that most recipients are unemployed. As healthcare has historically influenced midterm elections, Democrats are hoping to leverage Republicans' unpopularity, even as their own approval ratings remain low. With only 27% approval for congressional Democrats, the party faces internal challenges that could hinder their chances of regaining control of the House. Ultimately, for Democrats to succeed, they must address their own issues and unify ahead of the elections.
