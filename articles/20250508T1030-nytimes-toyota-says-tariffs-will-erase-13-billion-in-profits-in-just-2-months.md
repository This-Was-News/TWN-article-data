## Article summary
Toyota has projected a significant decline in its operating profit for the fiscal year ending in March, estimating a $1.3 billion loss due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. This marks a stark contrast to the previous year when the automaker experienced record profits, buoyed by strong demand for hybrids and a weak yen. The company’s chief executive, Koji Sato, expressed concerns over the unpredictable nature of the current auto industry environment, exacerbated by the implementation of a 25 percent tariff on vehicle imports and a recent extension to auto parts. 

While negotiations between Japan and the U.S. regarding tariffs continue, the situation remains tense, with Japan's envoy reporting significant losses for Japanese automakers. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the importance of not rushing to reach agreements that could compromise Japan's long-term interests. Economists warn that the tariffs could have a broader negative impact on Japan's economy, which heavily relies on its automotive sector. 

Despite these challenges, Toyota anticipates an increase in North American sales by 237,000 units this fiscal year, as it is less vulnerable to tariffs compared to smaller Japanese automakers. Other global automakers, including General Motors and European manufacturers, are also adjusting their forecasts in response to tariff-related uncertainties. The overall outlook for the Japanese auto industry appears grim as it navigates these turbulent trade conditions.
