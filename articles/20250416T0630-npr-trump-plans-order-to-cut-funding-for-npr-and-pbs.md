## Article summary
Trump plans to halt federal funding for NPR, PBS, and other public media, as outlined in a memo to Congress. This proposal, which aims to rescind $1.1 billion in funding over two years, will give Congress 45 days to approve or reject the cuts. The administration accuses these public broadcasters of promoting biased and "woke" programming, claiming that taxpayers should not subsidize such content. NPR and PBS officials argue that eliminating funding would severely impact local stations and the communities that rely on them for news and emergency information. 

While NPR receives about 1% of its funding directly from the federal government, PBS gets approximately 15%, with the majority of funds going to local stations. Recent polls show that a significant portion of the public supports continued federal funding for these networks, though opinions vary sharply along party lines. The Trump administration's actions have drawn criticism for potentially undermining the longstanding bipartisan support for public broadcasting. Additionally, there are ongoing investigations into NPR and PBS regarding their funding practices. Public media leaders emphasize their role in providing nonpartisan news and programming essential for American communities.
