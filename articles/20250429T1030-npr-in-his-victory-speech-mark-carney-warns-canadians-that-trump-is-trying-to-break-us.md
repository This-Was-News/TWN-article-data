## Article summary
Mark Carney has been elected as Canada's Prime Minister, leading the Liberal Party amid widespread public discontent towards U.S. President Donald Trump. In his victory speech, Carney emphasized the threats posed by Trump, asserting that "America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country" and vowed that Canada will not be broken by these pressures. The election results remain uncertain regarding whether the Liberal Party secured a majority in Parliament, as full results are pending. 

Carney's victory is attributed to his background in finance and his ability to resonate with voters concerned about Trump's aggressive policies, including threats of annexation and tariffs. He succeeded former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose resignation shifted voter sentiment in favor of the Liberals. Carney's opponent, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, faced challenges as his alignment with Trump ultimately diminished his appeal. 

International leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen and Australia's Prime Minister, expressed their support for Carney, highlighting a desire for continued cooperation. This election marks the fourth consecutive loss for the Conservative Party, prompting discussions about its future direction and messaging.
