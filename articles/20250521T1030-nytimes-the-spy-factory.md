## Article summary
The article details how Russian intelligence officers, operating under deep-cover identities, used Brazil as a base for espionage operations. One such officer, Artem Shmyrev, successfully posed as a Brazilian citizen while running a 3-D printing business in Rio de Janeiro. Over time, Russian spies in Brazil built new lives, complete with businesses and relationships, aiming to infiltrate other countries. Brazilian counterintelligence, through Operation East, eventually uncovered at least nine Russian operatives, dismantling a significant segment of Russia's illegals program. The investigation intensified following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to increased collaboration among global intelligence agencies. Notably, one Russian spy, Sergey Cherkasov, was arrested after attempting to infiltrate the International Criminal Court. Brazilian authorities issued Interpol notices for several spies, effectively exposing their identities and thwarting their operations. Shmyrev ultimately fled Brazil just before his cover was blown and has since disappeared. The article highlights the challenges and complexities of modern espionage, particularly for Russia's deep-cover operatives.
