## Article summary
Catastrophic flooding in central Texas has resulted in over 50 confirmed deaths, including 15 children, and left more than two dozen schoolgirls missing from a summer camp near the Guadalupe River. The Texas National Guard and state troopers are actively engaged in search and rescue efforts, with Governor Greg Abbott declaring a disaster and requesting federal assistance. Officials have rescued over 850 people, but many areas remain without power or communication. The flooding was exacerbated by a rapid rise in the Guadalupe River, which increased by 26 feet in just 45 minutes due to extreme rainfall. The National Weather Service has warned of potential additional rain, complicating recovery efforts. Local authorities emphasize that the search for survivors continues, although they anticipate transitioning to recovery operations soon. Families are anxiously waiting for news at reunification centers, with many still unaccounted for. The situation reflects a growing concern about climate change, which is believed to be increasing the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events. The terrain of the Hill Country, characterized by winding hills and limited absorption capacity, further contributes to the flood risk. Damage assessments are ongoing, and officials warn that the toll from this disaster could rise as recovery efforts progress.
