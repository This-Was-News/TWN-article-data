## Article summary
Venezuela has announced the resumption of repatriation flights for its citizens deported by U.S. immigration authorities, with flights expected to begin as early as Sunday. Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela's National Assembly, emphasized that "migration is not a crime" and stated that Venezuelan authorities will work tirelessly to secure the return of their citizens. This decision follows a halt in flights on March 8, which occurred after the U.S. government announced the cancellation of a permit allowing Chevron to operate in Venezuela.

The announcement comes amid ongoing tensions related to the deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they were reportedly transferred to a mega-prison. President Nicolás Maduro has called for the return of these migrants and claimed that they were kidnapped, disputing U.S. assertions that they had gang connections. The recent deportations, which included 238 Venezuelans, have drawn scrutiny and legal challenges.

The U.S. administration, under President Trump, has invoked the Alien Enemies Act to target alleged gang members among the deported individuals. Additionally, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has warned of impending sanctions unless Venezuela resumes accepting migrants. The situation highlights the complex dynamics of immigration and international relations between the U.S. and Venezuela.
