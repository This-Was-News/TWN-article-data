## Article summary
Elon Musk's takeover of the federal bureaucracy began with casual discussions at a 2023 dinner party and evolved into a strategic operation that granted him significant influence over government agencies. His initiative, dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was developed through secretive meetings and intelligence-gathering efforts, allowing him to embed his engineers within critical government infrastructure. Musk's approach aimed to dismantle regulatory oversight, leveraging his libertarian views and frustration with government processes. 

After Donald Trump's election, Musk's team quickly moved to gain access to sensitive government databases and took control of various agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management. The operation was characterized by rapid changes and aggressive cost-cutting strategies, mirroring Musk's tactics during his acquisition of Twitter. With the support of Trump and seasoned conservative operatives, Musk's team began executing their plan almost immediately after the inauguration, focusing on reducing the federal workforce and streamlining operations.

Musk's strategy relied on secrecy and a culture of loyalty among his recruits, which included young engineers and experienced advisors. The operation raised concerns among civil servants who were caught off guard by the speed and scale of the changes. Ultimately, Musk's influence and the establishment of DOGE represent a radical shift in how federal agencies operate, with potential long-term implications for government efficiency and oversight.
