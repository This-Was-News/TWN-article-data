## Article summary
In March 2024, the Trump administration introduced a process allowing companies to request exemptions from environmental rules via email to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). At least 15 coal plants, four steel mills, four chemical facilities, and two mines submitted such requests, with all coal plants and chemical facilities receiving exemptions for hazardous air pollutants like mercury and ethylene oxide. Over 100 exemptions were granted, including to oil refineries and iron ore processing sites, allowing them to delay compliance with upcoming regulations. The exemptions were issued under an obscure section of the Clean Air Act, which permits temporary relief if national security is at risk and required technology is unavailable. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, criticized the exemptions, arguing they undermine public health and transparency, while the Trump administration defended them as necessary for energy stability and economic security.
