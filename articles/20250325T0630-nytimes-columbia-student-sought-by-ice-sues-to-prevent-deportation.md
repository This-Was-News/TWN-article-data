## Article summary
Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia University student and legal permanent resident, has filed a lawsuit against President Trump and high-ranking officials after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attempted to arrest her. Chung, who has lived in the U.S. since she was seven and was a high school valedictorian, participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, which the Trump administration claims hinder its foreign policy regarding antisemitism. Despite not being a prominent activist, her involvement in protests led to immigration agents searching her university housing and residences linked to her family.

Her lawsuit alleges that ICE's actions are part of a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian advocates in the U.S., as seen in similar cases involving other students. Chung's legal team has requested that a judge prevent any deportation efforts against her based on her protected speech and activism. The lawsuit argues that the government misused warrants to target her and that her case reflects a troubling pattern of suppressing dissent.

Chung's situation escalated after her arrest during a protest at Barnard College. Following her arrest, ICE agents visited her family's home, claiming she was being sought for removal proceedings. The government has stated that she engaged in concerning conduct, linking her to support for Hamas. Chung's lawyers emphasize that she should not face deportation for exercising her free speech rights, highlighting the potential implications for many students voicing similar concerns.
