## Article summary
The article "Can You Ever Really Know a Person? Biographers Keep Trying" explores the enduring relevance of biography in an era of shrinking attention spans and minimalist art forms. Despite trends toward brevity in literature and media, biography remains a robust genre, often delving into the complexities of human motives and identities. The piece highlights recent biographies of figures like James Baldwin, emphasizing their focus on the nuanced and multifaceted nature of identity rather than offering definitive portrayals. It reflects on the historical evolution of biography, from its roots in public life to its contemporary interest in personal and private experiences. The author notes that biography resists strict narrative forms, blending elements of history, psychology, and literary criticism. The genre seeks to uncover the rich tapestry of individual lives, acknowledging the gaps and silences that shape human experience. Furthermore, the text contrasts the depth of biographical exploration with the limitations of artificial intelligence, which lacks the capacity to understand the intricacies of human motives and emotions. Ultimately, biography serves as a vital means of connecting with the essence of individuals, preserving their stories against the passage of time. Parul Sehgal, the critic, emphasizes the unique role of biography in capturing the human experience amidst the complexities of existence.
