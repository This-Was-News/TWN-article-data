## Article summary
In a recent Oval Office news conference, President Trump praised Elon Musk as he concluded his controversial tenure in government, which included significant budget cuts that ultimately fell short of his $1 trillion goal. Trump presented Musk with a golden key, emphasizing his support for the billionaire, who had contributed significantly to Trump's campaign. Musk, who appeared with a black eye from a playful incident with his son, faced questions regarding his drug use but deflected them, focusing instead on the future of his projects, including the ongoing initiatives associated with DOGE. The conference also highlighted Trump's criticism of federal judges and his push for increased tariffs on steel to protect U.S. industries. 

Fact-checking revealed that many of Trump's claims about budget cuts and the effectiveness of Musk's initiatives were exaggerated or misleading. Meanwhile, Musk's approach to cutting government spending shifted from a confident assertion of ease to acknowledging the complexities involved. Trump announced the firing of the National Portrait Gallery's director, citing her partisan stance, though legal experts questioned the legitimacy of his authority in this matter. Additionally, Trump reiterated his stance on tariffs and the urgent need for Congress to address the debt ceiling. Overall, the event showcased the evolving dynamics between Trump and Musk as they navigated their respective roles in politics and business.
