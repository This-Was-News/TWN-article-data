## Article summary
The article outlines Elon Musk's efforts to establish the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) following his appointment by Donald Trump. Initially unfamiliar with federal operations, Musk quickly learned the intricacies of government bureaucracy with the help of experienced political operatives. He sought direct access to governmental systems rather than forming a traditional commission, leveraging the U.S. Digital Service to facilitate his plans. Musk aimed for radical reforms similar to those he implemented at Twitter, expressing a desire to streamline the federal workforce. 

The timeline highlights key developments, starting from Musk's initial discussions about government efficiency in 2023, leading to the formal announcement of DOGE in November 2024. The name DOGE, a nod to the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin, was suggested by an online user, and Musk embraced it. By Inauguration Day in January 2025, Trump signed an executive order officially creating DOGE, allowing Musk to take charge of the digital unit and build his team. The article emphasizes the strategic groundwork laid by Musk and his allies even before Trump's inauguration, setting the stage for a significant overhaul of federal operations.
