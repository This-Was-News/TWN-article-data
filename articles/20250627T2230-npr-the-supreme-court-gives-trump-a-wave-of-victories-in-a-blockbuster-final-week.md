## Article summary
The Supreme Court's final week of its term resulted in significant victories for the Trump administration across various rulings. In a 6-3 decision, the Court limited federal courts' ability to issue universal injunctions, particularly regarding birthright citizenship, while temporarily blocking Trump's executive order for 30 days. Another ruling upheld parents' rights to opt their children out of classes that conflict with their religious beliefs, stirring concerns among educators about navigating such requests. The Court also upheld a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, ensuring continued access to free preventive services for approximately 150 million Americans.

Additionally, the Supreme Court supported a Texas law requiring age verification for access to pornographic websites, asserting it only incidentally burdens adults' speech. It also upheld a program providing subsidized internet access to underserved communities, rejecting challenges to the FCC's authority. The Court postponed a case regarding Louisiana's congressional redistricting to the next term, amid claims of illegal racial gerrymandering. Lastly, the Court allowed South Carolina to bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds for non-abortion services, emphasizing states' rights to disqualify providers. These decisions reflect the Court's ideological divisions and significant implications for various social and legal issues.
