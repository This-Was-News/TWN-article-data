## Article summary
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has sharply criticized Senator Chuck Schumer for collaborating with Republicans on a plan to prevent a government shutdown. She accused him of surrendering Democratic power over President Trump and labeled the proposed legislation as deeply partisan, suggesting it would empower Trump and Elon Musk at the expense of congressional authority. Ocasio-Cortez's remarks have sparked discussions about a potential primary challenge against Schumer in the 2028 election, although she did not confirm her intentions. 

The backlash against Schumer reflects growing frustrations among younger Democrats regarding the party's leadership, which they feel has failed to effectively counter Trump. Other House Democrats echoed Ocasio-Cortez's sentiments, condemning the Republican-crafted bill as harmful to everyday Americans. Schumer defended his decision, arguing that passing the bill was preferable to a government shutdown, which he feared would grant Trump even more power.

Despite the criticism, Schumer received unexpected praise from Trump for his actions. The procedural vote to advance the spending measure was passed with bipartisan support, setting the stage for a final vote later that day. The situation highlights a rift within the Democratic Party, particularly between its established leadership and younger, more progressive members.
