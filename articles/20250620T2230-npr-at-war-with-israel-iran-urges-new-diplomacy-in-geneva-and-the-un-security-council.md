## Article summary
Iran is seeking new diplomatic efforts amid its ongoing conflict with Israel, as foreign ministers from the UK, France, and Germany met with Iranian officials in Geneva. The discussions mark a significant diplomatic engagement since Israel's recent offensive against Iran. The European ministers emphasized the need to prevent escalation and questioned the necessity of Iran's nuclear programs, aiming for a negotiated solution to ensure Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while under attack and accused the U.S. of complicity in Israeli strikes. Meanwhile, U.S. officials, including President Trump, indicated that a diplomatic window exists for resolving the conflict, although skepticism remains from Israel regarding the effectiveness of negotiations. The U.N. Secretary-General urged for responsible action to prevent a wider war, while Israeli strikes have resulted in significant casualties on both sides. As the situation escalates, both Iran and Israel continue to conduct military operations against each other.
