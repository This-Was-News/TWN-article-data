## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the release on bail of Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist at Harvard, due to a lack of legal grounds for her visa revocation following a customs violation. Petrova was detained after failing to declare non-hazardous frog embryo samples she brought from France at Logan Airport. Judge Christina Reiss highlighted the potential dangers to Petrova's safety if deported to Russia and criticized the government's actions as extraordinary and improper. The case, which has garnered attention from the Trump administration, escalated when felony smuggling charges were filed against her after the judge indicated she would be released. Petrova, who fled Russia for political reasons, has admitted to the infraction, which her lawyer argues should only warrant a fine. Witnesses testified that the samples were non-toxic and of no commercial value. The judge noted that if her court does not address the constitutional rights violations, they may go unchallenged. The outcome of her criminal charges and potential immigration detainer remains uncertain. The case raises broader implications for similar situations involving academics.
