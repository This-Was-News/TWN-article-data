## Article summary
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant, was mistakenly deported from the United States despite a federal immigration judge's ruling against his return due to gang violence threats in El Salvador. His journey began as a teenager escaping the Barrio 18 gang in El Salvador, eventually settling in Maryland where he built a life, married, and raised three children, including one with special needs. Problems arose when he was arrested during a traffic stop and wrongfully identified as a member of MS-13 based on dubious evidence, leading to his detention and deportation. Despite having no criminal record, the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies targeted him, resulting in his deportation to El Salvador, where he faced the risk of violence. His wife, Jennifer Vasquez, fought to secure his return, highlighting the emotional toll on their family, particularly on their children. The deportation garnered widespread attention, symbolizing the harsh realities of U.S. immigration policies. A federal judge later questioned the government's justification for the deportation, emphasizing the need for due process. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled that steps must be taken to facilitate his return, although the government resisted rectifying its mistake. Garcia's case reflects the complexities of immigration and the personal struggles faced by families caught in the system.
