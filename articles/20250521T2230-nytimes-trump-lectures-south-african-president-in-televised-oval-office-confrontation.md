## Article summary
In a tense Oval Office meeting, President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, making false claims about a genocide against white Afrikaner farmers. The encounter showcased Trump's belief that white people face persecution, despite evidence indicating that violent crime affects all racial groups in South Africa. Initially, the discussion revolved around lighter topics like golf, but it escalated when a journalist questioned Trump's views on the alleged white genocide. Trump displayed a video purportedly showing violence against white farmers, which Ramaphosa argued misrepresented the situation in South Africa. He emphasized that crime affects all South Africans and that the country has a multiparty democracy. Despite Ramaphosa's attempts to steer the conversation towards trade and cooperation, Trump remained focused on his claims about land seizures and violence against white individuals. The meeting reflected Trump's selective concern for human rights, contrasting his treatment of South Africa with his recent visits to authoritarian regimes. Ramaphosa's efforts to maintain a cordial atmosphere were met with Trump's dismissive attitude, particularly towards Black delegates. Overall, the confrontation highlighted the deep divisions in perspectives on race and crime within South Africa.
