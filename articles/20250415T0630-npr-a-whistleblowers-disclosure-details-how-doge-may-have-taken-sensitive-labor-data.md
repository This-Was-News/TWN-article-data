## Article summary
A whistleblower has revealed that DOGE, a team associated with the Trump administration and led by Elon Musk, may have improperly accessed sensitive labor data from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The whistleblower's disclosure indicates that DOGE staffers sought extensive access to the NLRB's internal systems while disabling monitoring tools and attempting to erase records of their activities. Concerns arose when a spike in data transfer was detected, potentially involving confidential union information and proprietary business data. Experts fear this data could be exploited by corporations or intimidate whistleblowers, undermining the NLRB's integrity.

Despite NLRB officials denying any breach, the whistleblower provided evidence suggesting that DOGE's actions warranted further investigation by cybersecurity agencies. The situation has led to a culture of fear within the NLRB, especially after the whistleblower received threats related to his disclosures. Reports indicate that DOGE's data access practices could pose risks not only to labor rights but also to national security, as foreign adversaries might exploit vulnerabilities created by DOGE's actions. The whistleblower's concerns are echoed by multiple sources across various sectors, highlighting a troubling pattern of data mishandling within the government. Ultimately, the implications of DOGE's activities raise significant questions about the protection of sensitive information and the potential for conflicts of interest involving Musk's business interests.
