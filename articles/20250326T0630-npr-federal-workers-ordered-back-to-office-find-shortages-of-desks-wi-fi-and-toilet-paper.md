## Article summary
Federal workers ordered back to the office are facing significant chaos and shortages, including a lack of desks, Wi-Fi, and even toilet paper. Following President Trump's directive to end remote work, employees report confusion and frustrating conditions, such as being assigned to unsuitable locations, like storage units. Many federal agencies are struggling to accommodate the surge of returning employees, with reports of insufficient equipment and supplies due to budget constraints. Workers at various agencies have experienced overcrowded facilities, with basic necessities running out quickly and inadequate Wi-Fi for videoconferencing.

The return-to-office mandate has led some employees to feel it is an indirect push to quit, contradicting previous efforts to promote telework for efficiency and cost savings. Employees express that the transition back to in-person work has not improved productivity and, in some cases, has created additional burdens, such as commuting costs. Concerns about privacy and patient care have also arisen at the Department of Veterans Affairs due to crowding. Overall, the transition has been marked by a lack of clarity and resources, raising questions about its effectiveness and rationale.
