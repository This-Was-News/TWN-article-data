## Article summary
The Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge to President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship on May 15, 2025. This order, issued on the first day of his administration, has faced consistent legal opposition, with multiple courts blocking its implementation. The core issue revolves around Trump's assertion that the Constitution does not guarantee automatic citizenship to those born in the U.S., a view considered fringe by legal experts since the Supreme Court's ruling 127 years ago has remained unchallenged. 

Lower courts have rejected Trump's claims, emphasizing that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to all individuals born in the U.S., regardless of their parents' status. The Trump administration's lawyers have acknowledged the difficulties of their position, seeking to limit lower court rulings rather than outright reversing them. The Supreme Court's decision is anticipated by late June or early July, with significant implications for immigration law and citizenship rights in the U.S.
