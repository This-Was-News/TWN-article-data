## Article summary
The article explores President Trump's internal deliberations regarding his national security adviser, Michael Waltz, following a leak of a Signal group chat that included sensitive military discussions. Despite publicly defending Waltz, Trump privately questioned whether to fire him due to the media fallout and Waltz's perceived connections to journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, whom Trump dislikes. Meetings with key administration figures revealed Trump's reluctance to dismiss senior staff early in his second term, aiming to avoid the chaos of his first term's high turnover. Waltz's hawkish stance on military actions, particularly against Iran, had already placed him in a precarious position, further complicated by his association with Goldberg. While Trump expressed displeasure with the situation, he ultimately indicated a willingness to retain Waltz, citing support from others in the administration and a desire to maintain stability. The article highlights the challenges Trump's administration faces in balancing loyalty with the realities of Washington relationships. Despite the controversy, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared to be in a secure position, contrasting with Waltz's uncertain future. The incident underscores Trump's crisis management strategy, which involves denial and defiance, even in the face of mounting evidence against his staff. Ultimately, the article reflects on the complexities of loyalty and the dynamics within Trump's national security team.
