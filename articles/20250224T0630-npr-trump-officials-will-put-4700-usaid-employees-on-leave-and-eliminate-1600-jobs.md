## Article summary
The Trump administration plans to place 4,700 employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on paid administrative leave and eliminate 1,600 jobs as part of a significant downsizing effort. This decision follows a federal judge's ruling allowing the administration to proceed without causing irreparable harm to employees. The memo detailing the layoffs specifies that the terminated positions will be U.S.-based, with exceptions for critical roles and personnel in designated programs. Employees on leave will retain email access but cannot access agency files without permission. The administration's plan also includes a voluntary program for overseas employees to return to the U.S. 

This move is the latest in a series of actions aimed at dismantling USAID, which previously employed over 10,000 individuals. Unions representing agency staff had previously challenged the layoffs, arguing that they would jeopardize overseas personnel, particularly in conflict zones. The judge's ruling came after hearings in which the unions failed to demonstrate the potential harm of the downsizing plan. This development highlights the ongoing efforts of the Trump administration to reshape the agency's operations and workforce.
