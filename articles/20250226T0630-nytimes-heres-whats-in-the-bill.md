## Article summary
The House has passed a budget blueprint aimed at advancing President Trump's legislative agenda, which he described as a "ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL." This budget outlines significant tax cuts totaling up to $4.5 trillion and plans for $2 trillion in spending cuts, primarily targeting social programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The proposed legislation is expected to increase the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. House Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in garnering support, as differing priorities among Republicans complicate the budget's passage. 

Key areas for cuts include $880 billion from Medicaid, $330 billion from education programs, and $230 billion from agriculture, particularly affecting food assistance programs. While there are provisions for increased spending on border security and defense, the overall financial impact leans heavily towards deficit expansion. The budget also opens the possibility for new tax cuts, which may disproportionately benefit wealthier taxpayers. The bill is crucial for Republicans to bypass Senate filibusters and push through their agenda efficiently. Despite optimism, experts warn that the budget's economic growth assumptions may be unrealistic.
