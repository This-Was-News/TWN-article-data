## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary, ordered the removal of a deceptive web page created by the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, which mimicked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. This page suggested a link between vaccines and autism, contradicting the CDC's official stance that discredits such claims. The page was taken down after inquiries from The New York Times and sparked significant social media attention. Kennedy's directive included a formal demand for the page's removal, emphasizing the agency's commitment to evidence-based science. The fraudulent page closely resembled the CDC's layout and included misleading information, citing studies that misrepresented vaccine safety. Despite Kennedy's long-standing belief in a vaccine-autism link, extensive research has refuted this theory. The incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding vaccine misinformation, particularly as Children's Health Defense has been vocal during recent measles outbreaks. The CDC has recently announced plans to re-examine vaccine-related evidence, a move criticized by some lawmakers. Overall, the situation underscores the challenges of combating vaccine disinformation in the public sphere.
