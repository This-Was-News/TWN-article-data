## Article summary
A federal judge in Washington, James E. Boasberg, has threatened to initiate contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for allegedly violating an order to halt deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. The judge found probable cause that the administration disregarded his directive, which required the migrants to be given a chance to challenge their removal. The American Civil Liberties Union is involved in ongoing legal challenges against the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act in these deportations. Meanwhile, Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to advocate for Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported, who remains imprisoned there. Van Hollen accused the Trump administration of lying about Abrego Garcia's criminal history and highlighted that the Salvadoran government is reportedly being paid by the U.S. to detain him. The White House has indicated plans to appeal Judge Boasberg's ruling. In a separate legal move, the Trump administration has sued Maine over policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports, claiming violations of federal law. As tensions rise, both sides are entrenched in a politically charged battle over immigration and civil rights issues. The situation illustrates the ongoing conflict between the executive and judicial branches regarding compliance with court orders.
