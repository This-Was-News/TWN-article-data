## Article summary
An exhibit called "Faces of Gun Violence," which honored 120 victims of gun violence, has been removed from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) headquarters. The display included portraits and biographies of the victims, including Robert Godwin Sr., who was killed in 2017. The ATF, part of the Department of Justice, confirmed the removal and stated that it would continue to honor victims of violent crime in other ways. Critics, including families of victims, expressed their disappointment and concern over the decision, viewing it as politically motivated and indicative of a broader denial of gun violence issues. Brenda Joiner, Godwin's daughter, emphasized the importance of the memorial in recognizing lives lost to gun violence. The exhibit was dedicated in April 2024, and plans for the installation of a new group of honorees were already in place before the removal. Former ATF Director Steven Dettelbach described the exhibit as a permanent reminder of the agency's mission to honor victims. The Justice Department did not disclose the current whereabouts of the portraits. Families of victims, such as those from the Parkland shooting, have voiced their anger and sadness over the removal. The decision has sparked discussions about the ongoing impact of gun violence in America.
