## Article summary
The rising tariffs on bridal gowns are causing significant concern among brides and boutique owners alike, as most wedding dresses sold in the U.S. are manufactured overseas, predominantly in China. With tariffs previously set at 145% and now temporarily reduced to 30%, couples are facing additional costs of 10% to 15% on their gowns, leading to unexpected surcharges. Store owners, like Christine Greenberg and Claire Landgraf, are struggling to manage pricing uncertainties and the potential for future tariff increases, which complicates their budgeting and pricing strategies. American-made wedding dresses are typically much more expensive, starting at around double the price of imported gowns, and there is a lack of skilled labor to produce them domestically. Many designers and retailers are raising prices across the board to cover tariff costs, further discouraging brides from making purchases. The uncertainty surrounding these tariffs has led to a slower buying season, with brides taking longer to decide on their dresses and exploring alternative options like custom dressmakers. Some brides are reassessing their wedding budgets amidst rising costs, adding to the stress of planning their special day. The situation reflects a broader impact of trade policy on personal experiences, where political decisions intersect with the intimate process of selecting a wedding gown.
