## Article summary
At a recent rally in Los Angeles, Senator Bernie Sanders warned of an "extraordinary danger" facing the United States under President Donald Trump's administration. Addressing a crowd of approximately 36,000 supporters, Sanders criticized Trump's political, economic, and social policies, asserting that the country is currently experiencing an oligarchic society. He emphasized the significance of how Americans respond to this moment, as it will affect future generations. 

During the event, which featured performances by Joan Baez and Neil Young, Sanders reiterated his commitment to advocating for the working class against the interests of billionaires. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also spoke, highlighting the influence of corporate interests and lobbyists on wealth inequality and workers' rights. The rally was part of Sanders' "Fight Oligarchy" tour, where he continues to address the challenges posed by the current political climate. 

As Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez plan further stops in Idaho, California, and Montana, the contrasting atmosphere of Trump's attendance at a UFC event that same night, where he received enthusiastic applause, underscores the division in American political sentiment.
