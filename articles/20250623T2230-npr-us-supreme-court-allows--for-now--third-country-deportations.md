## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily stayed a lower court's order requiring individuals facing deportation to countries other than their own to be allowed to challenge their deportation orders. This decision impacts a flight carrying men from various countries, initially destined for South Sudan but redirected to Djibouti. The U.S. government argues these individuals are violent criminals who should not remain in the country. The dissenting liberal justices expressed concern over the potential risks of torture and unsafe conditions in the countries to which these individuals are being sent. U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer claimed that the lower court's order was causing disruption in the deportation process. Immigration lawyers emphasized that even those with criminal backgrounds deserve fair notice and an opportunity to contest their deportation. The Trump administration has focused on expedited deportations by encouraging third countries to accept U.S. deportees. The court's liberal justices criticized the government's failure to comply with due process requirements, asserting that such conduct undermines the rule of law. Ultimately, the Supreme Court's decision reflects ongoing tensions surrounding immigration policy and deportation procedures.
