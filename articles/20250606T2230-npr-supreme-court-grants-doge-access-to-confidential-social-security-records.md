## Article summary
The Supreme Court has granted the DOGE team, initiated by Elon Musk, access to confidential Social Security records, including sensitive personal information. This decision temporarily overturns lower court rulings that had restricted this access, following a request from the Trump administration. The vote was 6 to 3, with the conservative majority favoring DOGE while the liberal justices expressed concerns about privacy risks. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson criticized the majority for prioritizing government urgency over legal processes, arguing that citizens' personal data is now at risk. The case originated when Trump directed DOGE to modernize federal technology, leading to initial resistance from the Social Security Administration's former commissioner. After her resignation, her successor granted DOGE access, prompting legal challenges citing violations of the federal Fair Privacy Act. The government argues that the Privacy Act allows for internal sharing of information necessary for official duties. A federal judge had previously blocked DOGE's access, but the Supreme Court's recent ruling allows it to proceed. Additionally, the court ruled that DOGE is not required to provide internal documents to a watchdog group under the Freedom of Information Act. The dissenting justices reiterated their concerns regarding privacy and the implications of the decision.
