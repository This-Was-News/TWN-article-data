## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, is poised to win the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo in a significant political upset. With 93% of votes counted, Mamdani secured 44% compared to Cuomo's 36%, prompting Cuomo to concede. Mamdani's grassroots campaign focused on making the city more affordable and resonated with younger voters, contrasting starkly with Cuomo's establishment approach. His platform included raising taxes on billionaires and enhancing mental health outreach, rather than increasing police presence. 

Mamdani's victory reflects a generational shift within the Democratic Party, as he was supported by prominent leftist figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. The primary race showcased a rejection of the centrist politics that defined Cuomo's career, especially against the backdrop of his past controversies. If confirmed as the official nominee, Mamdani will face current Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent in the general election. His campaign mobilized nearly 50,000 volunteers, and he performed particularly well in Brooklyn, outperforming Cuomo by 17 percentage points. Mamdani's win could make him the first Muslim and Asian American mayor of New York City, promising to govern with a vision of equity and dignity for all residents.
