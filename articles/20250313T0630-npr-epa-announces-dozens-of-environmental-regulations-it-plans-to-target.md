## Article summary
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to target over two dozen environmental regulations, marking what it calls a significant day of deregulation in U.S. history. The agency has not specified whether it intends to weaken or eliminate these regulations, which cover areas such as climate pollution from vehicles and power plants, wastewater from coal plants, and air pollution from various sectors. Critics, including environmental groups, express concern that this move aims to undermine the EPA's ability to combat climate change and protect public health. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the intention is to lower living costs and boost American energy production.

The agency's reconsideration of rules includes those finalized under the Biden administration that limit emissions from power plants, which are a major source of greenhouse gases. Additionally, the EPA plans to revisit air pollution standards for vehicles, reversing stricter regulations established previously. The agency is also reassessing its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, which could impact future regulations. Environmental advocates warn of potential legal challenges to any rollback of these regulations, emphasizing the importance of maintaining stringent standards to protect health and the environment.
