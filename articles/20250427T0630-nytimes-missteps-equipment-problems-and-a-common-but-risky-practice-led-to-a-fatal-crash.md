## Article summary
The article details the tragic collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet at Reagan National Airport on January 29, 2025, which resulted in the deaths of all 64 people aboard both aircraft. The crash was attributed to a series of missteps, including the helicopter crew's ineffective execution of visual separation, which allowed them to navigate without direct controller guidance. Compounding the situation were communication failures, altitude miscalculations, and the helicopter's transponder being turned off for security reasons, limiting the controller's ability to track its movements. The air traffic controller, who was managing both helicopter and commercial jet traffic, did not provide clear instructions to the helicopter crew, contributing to the disaster. Investigators found that systemic issues within the FAA, including low staffing levels and the combined duties of controllers, played a role in the crash. The NTSB is expected to release a final report by early 2026, while the FAA has since banned most helicopter flights along the route involved. The article highlights the risks associated with visual separation practices, particularly in busy airspaces, and emphasizes the need for clearer communication and protocols to prevent future accidents.
