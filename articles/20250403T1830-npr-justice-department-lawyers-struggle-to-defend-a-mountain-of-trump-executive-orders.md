## Article summary
The Justice Department is facing significant challenges in defending President Trump's executive orders, as its lawyers struggle to keep pace with over 130 lawsuits filed recently. A substantial decrease in staffing has left the department ill-equipped to manage the volume of litigation, with many experienced attorneys having left or been reassigned. This has led to mistakes in court filings and difficulties in answering judges' questions, raising concerns about the department's credibility. Critics, including legal experts, have noted that the DOJ is failing to provide adequate legal justification for Trump's controversial actions, such as the birthright citizenship order, which conflicts with constitutional provisions. 

Moreover, the DOJ has been accused of making strategic decisions to withhold information from the courts, further complicating their defense. Attorney General Pamela Bondi has emphasized the importance of zealous representation, but this directive has been met with skepticism given the current state of the department. The rapid pace of Trump's executive actions and the resulting legal challenges have created a "fire drill" atmosphere, hindering effective interagency communication. As the DOJ navigates this complex landscape, its ability to maintain credibility and provide sound legal arguments remains under scrutiny.
