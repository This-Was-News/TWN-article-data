## Article summary
Russia launched its largest drone-and-missile attack on Ukraine to date, targeting Kyiv and over 30 other cities, resulting in at least 12 fatalities and numerous injuries. The assault, which included 69 missiles and 298 drones, marked a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, coinciding with Kyiv Day, a national holiday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as deliberate attacks on civilian areas and called for increased sanctions against Russia. The strikes resulted in extensive damage to residential buildings, with reports of casualties, including children, in various regions.

Ukrainian air defense forces engaged in prolonged efforts to intercept the incoming threats, while the Russian Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 110 Ukrainian drones. The attacks came amid a planned prisoner swap between the two nations, which had yielded some cooperation but failed to lead to a ceasefire. Eyewitness accounts described devastation in affected areas, with residents expressing grief over lost homes and pets. Despite the ongoing exchanges, fighting along the front lines continues unabated, highlighting the persistent violence of the conflict. Overall, this incident underscores the brutal reality of the war as both sides remain entrenched in their positions.
