## Article summary
The Pentagon is set to hold a briefing following U.S. airstrikes on Iran, which President Trump described as a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted three nuclear sites, with Trump asserting that Iran's key facilities have been "obliterated." He emphasized that Iran must now pursue peace or face greater future attacks. The briefing will be led by Gen. Dan Cain and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth at 8 a.m. ET. 

Republican leaders praised Trump's actions, while Democrats criticized him for allegedly violating the Constitution by not seeking congressional approval. There was a lack of clarity on when senior Republican leaders were informed about the strikes, although some were alerted shortly before Trump's announcement. 

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner expressed concern that these actions could escalate into a new conflict, urging the president to clarify strategic objectives and ensure American safety. Trump also called for peace in his announcement and warned Iran against retaliation.
