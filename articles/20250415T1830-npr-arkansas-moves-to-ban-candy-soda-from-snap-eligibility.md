## Article summary
Arkansas Governor Sarah Sanders has proposed a ban on the purchase of candy and soda using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, aiming to promote healthier food choices among low-income residents. The state has submitted a waiver to the federal government to implement these restrictions, which also seeks to add rotisserie chicken to the list of SNAP-eligible items. Currently, beneficiaries can buy soft drinks and candy bars but not Arkansas-raised hot rotisserie chicken, which Sanders criticized as illogical.

The governor highlighted that a significant portion of SNAP funds—23%—is spent on sugary drinks and sweets, contributing to chronic health issues that cost the Arkansas Medicaid program $300 million annually. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins supported the initiative, encouraging states to adopt measures that foster healthier eating habits. However, the proposal has faced backlash from the candy and beverage industries, with critics labeling the policy as misguided.

The Arkansas Department of Human Services, which oversees both SNAP and Medicaid, echoed the sentiment that allowing the purchase of unhealthy foods undermines health efforts. The state plans to utilize the GS1 categorization model to facilitate the implementation of these changes in retail settings.
