## Article summary
Columbia University is facing significant turmoil as the Trump administration has issued an ultimatum demanding major changes or the loss of billions in federal funding. A recent letter from federal officials requires the university to place its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under "academic receivership" for five years, although the reasons for this demand remain unclear. The administration has previously canceled $400 million in federal grants, citing Columbia's failure to address antisemitism amid pro-Palestinian protests on campus.

In addition to the receivership, the administration demands strict disciplinary measures against students involved in protests, the establishment of a formal antisemitism policy, and a ban on masks that conceal identities during demonstrations. Columbia's interim president has stated that the university is reviewing the letter and remains committed to its mission. The situation escalated following the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a former student and activist involved in the protests, leading to increased scrutiny from federal agents.

This conflict reflects broader tensions regarding free speech and federal oversight in higher education, with critics arguing that the administration's actions are an attempt to suppress dissent and manipulate concerns about antisemitism. The university's leaders are now grappling with the potential implications of these federal demands on their operations and student rights.
