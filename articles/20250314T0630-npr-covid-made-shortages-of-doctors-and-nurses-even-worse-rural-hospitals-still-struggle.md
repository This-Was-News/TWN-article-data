## Article summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing shortages of doctors and nurses in the U.S., particularly in rural hospitals like Keokuk County Hospital in Iowa, which struggles to find enough staff to operate effectively. Many healthcare workers retired or left their positions during the pandemic due to burnout and stress, leading to a significant staffing crisis. Experts note that the aging physician workforce and increased early retirements have worsened the situation, with Iowa ranking low in patient-to-physician ratios. 

While nursing education and employment rates have rebounded nationally, recruiting nurses to rural areas remains a challenge, as many prefer urban settings. Rural hospitals are now increasingly reliant on traveling nurses, which strains their budgets. Efforts to address these shortages include legislative measures aimed at increasing medical student loan forgiveness and easing licensing for foreign-trained physicians. However, the long-term nature of training new doctors means immediate relief is unlikely. 

Support from hospital management is crucial for retaining existing staff, as many healthcare workers report feeling disrespected and unsafe in their roles. The ongoing crisis impacts patient care, with fewer nurses leading to increased workloads and potential declines in care quality. Without significant investment in the healthcare workforce, the shortages are projected to worsen, particularly affecting vulnerable populations.
