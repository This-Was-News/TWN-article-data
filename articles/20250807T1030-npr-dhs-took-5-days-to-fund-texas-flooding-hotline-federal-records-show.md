## Article summary
After floods devastated Texas Hill Country in July 2025, most calls to FEMA's disaster assistance hotline went unanswered due to a lapse in funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The funding delay, which lasted five days, was attributed to an administrative bottleneck where DHS Secretary Kristi Noem personally approves all large funding requests. This process differed from previous administrations, where the FEMA administrator had the authority to approve such expenditures. The lapse resulted in FEMA call centers answering only about 15,000 of the approximately 55,000 calls received from disaster survivors between July 6 and July 10. The delay caused significant backlogs, with survivors waiting over 90 minutes to get through. FEMA's acting administrator, David Richardson, sent a memo to Noem on July 10, highlighting the dire effects of the delay and requesting immediate funding approval. The funding was approved later that day, restoring adequate staffing to the call centers. Critics, including former FEMA officials and a Texas county commissioner, expressed frustration over the agency's understaffing and under-resourcing. FEMA's statement claiming swift and efficient response contradicted internal call logs and Richardson's memo. The incident raised concerns about the agency's preparedness and the impact of recent staff reductions under the Trump administration.
