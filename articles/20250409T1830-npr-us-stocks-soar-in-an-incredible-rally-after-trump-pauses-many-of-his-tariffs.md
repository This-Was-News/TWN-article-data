## Article summary
U.S. stocks experienced a significant rally on April 9, 2025, following President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on most tariffs, with the exception of those on Chinese goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged nearly 3,000 points, an increase of close to 8%, while the S&P and Nasdaq saw gains of over 9% and 12%, respectively. This surge came after a period of steep losses in global markets attributed to Trump's previous tariff announcements, which included reciprocal tariffs on various countries. The president's decision to pause many tariffs provided relief to investors, although he maintained a 10% tariff on all other countries and proposed raising tariffs on China to 125% after China's retaliatory measures. Despite the pause, ongoing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports remain in effect. The market's reaction indicates investor optimism, although concerns persist regarding the unresolved tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors are expected to closely monitor future developments in these trade relations.
