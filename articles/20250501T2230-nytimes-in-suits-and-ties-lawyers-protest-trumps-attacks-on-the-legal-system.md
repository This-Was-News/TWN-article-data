## Article summary
Lawyers gathered in Foley Square, Manhattan, to protest President Trump's perceived attacks on the legal system during the National Law Day of Action, with around 1,500 participants dressed in business attire. The demonstrators chanted in support of the rule of law and held pocket Constitutions, emphasizing their commitment to legal ethics amidst Trump's actions that threaten their profession. Many lawyers feel compelled to speak out against Trump's targeting of elite law firms and his executive orders limiting their access to federal resources. The rally featured a ceremonial reaffirmation of their oaths, underscoring the seriousness of the situation as lawyers expressed their moral obligation to uphold the law. Attendees, including law students, voiced concerns over the implications of capitulating to Trump's pressures, with some creating initiatives to track firms that have complied with his demands. Key figures, such as law professors and former prosecutors, highlighted the importance of lawyers standing firm against perceived tyranny. The protest was part of a broader movement across 50 cities, reflecting a growing urgency among legal professionals to defend judicial integrity.
