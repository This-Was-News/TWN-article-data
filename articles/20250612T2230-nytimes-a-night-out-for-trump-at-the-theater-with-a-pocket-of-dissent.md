## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's attendance at the opening night of "Les Misérables" at the Kennedy Center, highlighting a mix of support and dissent present at the event. Just before Trump's arrival, drag queens, including a nonbinary individual named Vagenesis, entered the theater, symbolizing a protest against Trump's anti-drag stance. Despite the presence of Trump supporters, there were audible boos and heckles directed at the president during his entrance. The performance, which Trump has a personal affinity for, coincided with ongoing protests against his immigration policies, drawing parallels between the musical's themes and current societal issues. 

As Trump and the First Lady took their seats, they faced a mix of cheers and boos, while some audience members expressed their admiration for him, oblivious to the show's relevance to contemporary struggles. The article notes that Trump's administration has worked to create a welcoming environment for him, limiting media access to avoid dissent. Despite the political tensions, Vagenesis reported a surprisingly positive reception from the audience. Ultimately, the event served as a microcosm of the polarized political climate, with both supporters and dissenters making their voices heard.
