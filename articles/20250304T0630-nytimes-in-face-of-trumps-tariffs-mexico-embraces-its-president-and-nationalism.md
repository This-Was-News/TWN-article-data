## Article summary
In response to President Trump's tariffs, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has seen a surge in nationalism and her approval ratings, which have reached as high as 80%. During a recent Flag Day ceremony, she emphasized Mexico's resilience and the importance of unity against foreign pressures. The tariffs, which were set to take effect, have prompted a revival of the "Made in Mexico" campaign, encouraging consumers to support local products and businesses. This movement has led to calls for boycotts of U.S. goods, with many Mexicans rallying around their national identity.

Sheinbaum's administration has also increased military presence at the border to address concerns about drug trafficking and immigration, negotiating with the U.S. to delay the tariffs in exchange for cooperation on these issues. Despite the economic threats posed by the tariffs, there is a strong sense of unity in Mexico, with various companies joining the push for national pride. The relationship between Mexico and the U.S. has become strained, with rising negative sentiments towards Trump among Mexicans.

Analysts suggest that the tariffs could ultimately harm both economies, yet Sheinbaum's strategy aims to diversify Mexico's economy and reduce dependence on the U.S. The "Made in Mexico" initiative has gained traction, with major retailers like Walmart promoting local products. Overall, the tariffs have galvanized a sense of nationalism in Mexico, as citizens and leaders alike seek to protect their national interests.
