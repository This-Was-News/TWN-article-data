## Article summary
The British government has taken control of the country's last major steel mill, located in Scunthorpe, to prevent its Chinese owners, Jingye, from potentially closing the facility and jeopardizing 2,700 jobs. This decision was made through emergency legislation, with lawmakers summoned back from vacation to approve it. Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized the importance of steel to Britain's industrial strength and national identity, acknowledging the industry's long-term decline. Despite the government's insistence that it is not nationalizing British Steel, critics argue that the actions amount to a form of nationalization. The government aims to find a partner to invest in greener steel-making technologies, while facing challenges such as high energy costs and competition from global markets. Reynolds accused Jingye of attempting to force a shutdown by starving the plant of raw materials. This move comes amid concerns over economic nationalism and the need for domestic production capabilities. The Scunthorpe plant is crucial as it houses the last two operating blast furnaces in Britain, which produce high-quality steel. The situation is complicated by Jingye's financial struggles, with losses reported at £700,000 a day.
