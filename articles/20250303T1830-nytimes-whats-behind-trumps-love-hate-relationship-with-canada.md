## Article summary
The article examines President Trump's complex and often antagonistic relationship with Canada, a significant trading partner for the United States. It suggests that Trump's bitterness may stem from failed Canadian hotel ventures and personal grievances, including a perceived slight involving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The transactional view posits that Trump sees Canada as a potential 51st state, reflecting his real estate ambitions. As Trump pushes for new tariffs, his rhetoric has turned increasingly hostile, causing political upheaval in Canada and a surge in Canadian nationalism in response to his insults. The article contrasts Trump's aggressive style with Trudeau's more conciliatory approach, highlighting their strained interactions, especially following the contentious 2018 G7 summit. Additionally, Trudeau speculates that Trump's interest in Canada is driven by its natural resources, which the U.S. administration is keen to exploit. Historically, Trump's attitude toward Canada was more favorable, but his presidential campaign focused on criticizing trade agreements like NAFTA. Now, with renewed threats of tariffs, Trump appears unconcerned about the potential economic fallout for Canada, asserting that the U.S. could sever ties if necessary. Overall, the article underscores the deepening rift between the two nations under Trump's leadership.
