## Article summary
The Trump administration is seeking to access extensive personal data held by states, which manage various federal programs like food stamps and Medicaid. Critics argue this data could be used to monitor immigrants, political opponents, or falsely portray widespread fraud. The administration claims it needs this information to prevent waste, ensure election integrity, and enforce immigration laws. States, led by Democratic attorneys general, are suing the federal government, arguing that the data requests overstep federal authority and violate privacy agreements. The push for state data is part of a broader trend by the Trump administration to centralize and utilize personal information for various purposes, raising concerns about privacy and federal overreach.
