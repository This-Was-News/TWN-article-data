## Article summary
The U.S. and Iran recently commenced a new round of nuclear negotiations in Muscat, Oman, with both sides agreeing to meet again the following week. The talks, described as "positive and constructive" by the White House, focused on Iran's nuclear program and the potential lifting of sanctions. Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, noted that the discussions were framed as indirect talks, while the U.S. referred to them as direct negotiations. This effort marks a shift from former President Trump's previous stance, where he withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and implemented a "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran.

Both countries have motivations to reach an agreement: the U.S. seeks to avoid conflict in the Middle East, while Iran is facing economic difficulties exacerbated by sanctions. The negotiations occur amidst ongoing regional tensions, including U.S. military actions against Iranian-backed groups. A critical aspect of the talks is the scope of the potential deal, as Iran prefers to limit discussions to nuclear issues, while U.S. officials aim for a broader agreement addressing missiles and regional proxies. The outcome of these negotiations remains uncertain, with both sides navigating a significant wall of mistrust.
