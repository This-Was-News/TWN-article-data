## Article summary
Democrats in districts won by Trump are urging the party to rebrand in order to regain the House majority. They emphasize that merely opposing Trump is insufficient; a new strategy is necessary. Representatives like Tom Suozzi argue that the Democratic brand is currently damaged, lacking a clear identity beyond social issues. He suggests that the party should focus on economic policies that resonate with working-class voters, such as job creation and wage increases. 

Marcy Kaptur highlights the need to expand the party's coalition by addressing the concerns of Trump voters, particularly regarding economic opportunities. Gabe Vasquez reinforces that understanding constituents' economic issues is crucial for connecting with voters. Jason Crow, tasked with recruiting new Democratic candidates, stresses the importance of presenting relatable candidates who understand the challenges faced by everyday people. 

Overall, the Democrats' path to success depends on a shift towards economic messaging and a broader appeal to working-class and rural voters, moving beyond identity politics.
