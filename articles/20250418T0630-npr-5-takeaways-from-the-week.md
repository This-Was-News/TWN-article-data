## Article summary
The week was marked by significant developments involving President Trump, particularly around the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was illegally deported to El Salvador. Tensions escalated as a federal judge indicated potential contempt charges against the Trump administration for defying court orders related to Garcia's return. The administration's stance, articulated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was that no court could dictate U.S. foreign policy, raising concerns about a constitutional crisis if they continued to ignore judicial rulings. Additionally, Trump's tariffs were expected to lead to higher inflation, prompting warnings from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about the economic implications. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now Health and Human Services Secretary, faced criticism for his controversial views on vaccines and autism, contradicting established scientific consensus. The administration's messaging around Garcia included allegations of gang affiliation, despite a lack of credible evidence. This week also saw political maneuvering regarding immigration policies and budget cuts impacting various federal programs. As the administration navigated these controversies, it became clear that perceptions and narratives were central to its strategy. Overall, the week highlighted ongoing tensions between the executive branch and the judiciary, alongside broader economic and health policy challenges.
