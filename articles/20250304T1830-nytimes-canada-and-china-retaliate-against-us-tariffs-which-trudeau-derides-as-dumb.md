## Article summary
The article discusses the escalating trade tensions following President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Canada and China swiftly retaliated with their own tariffs, raising concerns of a potential trade war. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticized the U.S. tariffs as "dumb" and announced a 25 percent tariff on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, with plans to extend it further. China responded by imposing tariffs on various American agricultural products, including chicken and soybeans.

The tariffs prompted declines in global stock markets, particularly affecting the automotive sector, and led to warnings of rising consumer prices in the U.S. Amid the conflict, Trump and Trudeau exchanged pointed remarks, with Trudeau emphasizing that Canada would never be annexed by the U.S. and expressing disappointment over the tariffs on a close ally. The article notes that American companies are bracing for price increases, and economists predict negative impacts on economic growth for both the U.S. and its trading partners.

Despite mixed public opinion on tariffs, some labor groups supported the measures as a way to protect American jobs. The situation remains fluid, with U.S. officials offering conflicting statements on future tariff negotiations, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the trade dispute.
