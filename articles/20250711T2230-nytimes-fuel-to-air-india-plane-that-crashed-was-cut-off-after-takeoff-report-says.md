## Article summary
A preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash revealed that fuel was cut off to both engines seconds after takeoff, with no evidence of mechanical failure or design flaws. The cockpit voice recording indicated confusion between the pilots about the fuel cutoff, with one pilot denying any action. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after departing from Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard and over 200 on the ground. Investigators, including India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, and Boeing, are analyzing data from the recovered black boxes. The crash has raised questions about pilot actions and brought scrutiny to both Boeing and Air India, the country's oldest carrier, as it seeks to modernize.
