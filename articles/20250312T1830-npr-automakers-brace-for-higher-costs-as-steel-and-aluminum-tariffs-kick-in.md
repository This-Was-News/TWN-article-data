## Article summary
The automotive industry is facing increased challenges as President Trump has raised tariffs on steel and aluminum to 25%, impacting automakers significantly. These tariffs, justified on national security grounds, apply without exceptions, adding financial strain to manufacturers who rely heavily on these raw materials. Although some domestic steel producers welcome the tariffs, the Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users warns that they disadvantage U.S. manufacturers who do not import these metals. Ford's CEO acknowledged that even domestic sourcing will lead to higher costs due to suppliers’ international sources. 

The tariffs come amid ongoing uncertainties from previous tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which could further inflate costs if reimposed. Analysts suggest that manufacturers have limited options, primarily either sourcing domestically or absorbing higher costs for imports. The unpredictability of future tariffs adds to the difficulty of strategic planning for automakers. While Trump claims these measures protect U.S. jobs, the industry is more focused on stabilizing costs and navigating trade complexities. Ultimately, the auto sector seeks more consistency in regulations and trade policies rather than abrupt changes.
