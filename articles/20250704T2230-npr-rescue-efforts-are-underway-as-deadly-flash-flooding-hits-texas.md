## Article summary
Severe flooding in Kerr County has resulted in at least 13 fatalities and left 20 girls missing from a summer camp. Local and state law enforcement are conducting rescue operations, urging residents to shelter in place and move to higher ground, especially those near creeks and the Guadalupe River. Meteorologist Jason Runyan reported that heavy rainfall has caused significant rises in the river, comparable to the catastrophic flood of 1987. A flash flood emergency has been declared, with continuous heavy rain expected throughout the day. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly declared a disaster and noted that the area lacks a warning system for the river, which contributed to the lack of evacuation at summer camps. The National Weather Service had predicted less rain than what ultimately fell, exceeding a foot in some areas. Texas is deploying resources, including water rescue teams and shelters, to assist affected residents. Reunification centers have been established for those seeking missing loved ones. Road closures have been implemented across the region due to the flooding. The situation remains critical as rescue efforts continue.
