## Article summary
President Trump has issued an executive order to terminate federal funding for NPR and PBS, citing ideological bias in their reporting. He directed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to stop funding these major public broadcasters, claiming they do not provide fair and accurate portrayals of events. However, PBS President Paula Kerger labeled the order "blatantly unlawful," arguing that the CPB is an independent entity not subject to presidential authority. The CPB has stated that Congress established it as a private nonprofit corporation, prohibiting federal control over its operations. Trump's order appears to suggest continued subsidies for other public radio and television stations, but it contradicts his push to eliminate all funding for public broadcasting. NPR has pledged to defend its rights against the executive order, emphasizing its role in providing essential news services. Both NPR and PBS leaders testified before Congress, defending their commitment to nonpartisan reporting amidst allegations of bias. Federal funding for these networks is crucial, as NPR receives about 1% of its funding directly from the government, while PBS relies on CPB for approximately 15% of its revenue. The CPB is currently suing the Trump administration over attempts to fire board members, which complicates the situation regarding funding and governance. Overall, the executive order raises significant legal and operational questions about the future of public broadcasting in the U.S.
