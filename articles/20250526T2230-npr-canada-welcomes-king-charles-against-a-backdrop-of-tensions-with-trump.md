## Article summary
King Charles III and Queen Camilla have begun a two-day visit to Canada, a trip seen as a reinforcement of the country's sovereignty amid tensions with President Trump, who has suggested making Canada the 51st U.S. state. Upon arrival in Ottawa, they were greeted by dignitaries, including Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney and the first Indigenous governor general, Mary Simon. Carney, elected on an anti-Trump platform, emphasized the significance of the king's visit, stating it reflects the enduring friendship and distinct identity of Canada. During their time together, Carney and King Charles are expected to meet. 

On the following day, King Charles will deliver a speech from the throne to open a new session of Canada's parliament, marking the first time a monarch has done so since 1977. Although the event is largely ceremonial, it highlights the differences between U.S. and Canadian democracies, with Canada being a constitutional monarchy. The speech will outline the government's future plans, written by Carney's office, and is anticipated to strongly affirm Canada's sovereignty. This visit is Charles' first since his coronation in 2023 and follows a previous trip that was canceled due to his health issues. He has previously expressed admiration for Canada and its populace.
