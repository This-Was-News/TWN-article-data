## Article summary
A shooter identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman opened fire at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, killing two students and wounding over a dozen others. Police Chief Brian O'Hara described the attack as an intentional act of terror against innocent children. Investigators found evidence of Westman's hatred towards various groups and his admiration for mass murderers. Surveillance video showed Westman firing through stained-glass windows without entering the church. The victims included 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and another 10-year-old, with 15 children and three elderly parishioners injured. Westman, who had a history of mental health issues, left behind videos and writings expressing his grievances and plans. He was armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol and died by suicide. The FBI classified the attack as domestic terrorism motivated by hate-filled ideology. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz deployed state law enforcement to schools and churches in response. The community mourned the tragic loss, with families and survivors struggling to cope with the aftermath.
