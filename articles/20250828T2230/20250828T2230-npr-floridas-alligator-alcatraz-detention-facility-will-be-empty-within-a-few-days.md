## Article summary
Florida's immigrant detention center, nicknamed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' is expected to be empty within a few days. The facility, located in the Everglades, has seen a decline in detainees, with the executive director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management stating that the number will soon reach zero. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis confirmed an increased pace of removals. A federal judge ordered the facility to stop accepting new detainees and to wind down operations within 60 days, following a lawsuit by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe. The facility, built at a cost of over $400 million, has faced legal challenges over its construction and environmental impact. The Department of Homeland Security is moving detainees to other facilities to comply with the court order, while appealing the decision. Volunteers have observed buses transporting detainees out of the facility, indicating its phased closure. Critics argue the facility is inappropriate for detention and should be shut down completely once empty.
