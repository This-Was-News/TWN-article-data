## Article summary
The Trump administration awarded a $1.2 billion contract to Acquston Logstcs LLC, a small company with no experience in running detention facilities, to build and operate a massive migrant detention camp at Fort Bliss in Texas. The contract, which is shrouded in secrecy, has raised concerns about the company's qualifications and the rushed construction process. The camp, expected to house up to 5,000 migrants, is part of the administration's broader push to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without legal status. Critics have expressed worries about the lack of transparency and potential for abuse, drawing comparisons to historical military detention camps. The use of military bases for detention has been criticized for limiting access and oversight. The contract has faced legal challenges, with one competitor filing a complaint. The administration has defended the camp, stating it will provide necessary services and meet legal standards. The camp's construction began quickly, with three large tents and several smaller buildings already erected. The situation highlights the administration's reliance on private and military entities for immigration enforcement tasks.
