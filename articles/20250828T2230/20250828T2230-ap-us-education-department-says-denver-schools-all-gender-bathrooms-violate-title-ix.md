## Article summary
The U.S. Education Department has found that Denver Public Schools violated Title IX protections against sex-based discrimination by creating all-gender bathrooms and allowing students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity. The investigation, initiated under the Trump administration, followed the school district's conversion of a girls' restroom into an all-gender restroom. The department has given the school district 10 days to revert the all-gender bathrooms back to gender-designated ones or face enforcement action. Additionally, the department wants the district to use biology-based definitions for male and female in all Title IX-related policies and practices. This finding aligns with the Trump administration's broader push against policies accommodating transgender students. Denver Public Schools officials have received the investigation results and are determining their next steps. The Trump administration has launched multiple investigations into transgender policies in schools across several states, focusing on issues like bathroom and sports team access. Supporters of these actions argue they restore fairness, while opponents view them as attacks on transgender youth.
