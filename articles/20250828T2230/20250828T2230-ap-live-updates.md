## Article summary
Jim O'Neill, a top deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will serve as acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after Susan Monarez was fired by President Donald Trump for not aligning with his mission. The CDC is in chaos, with four other agency leaders resigning. The changes at the CDC could affect COVID-19 vaccination recommendations, making it more complicated for people to get shots. The CDC's disruption could also jeopardize local health services. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has asked a military base outside Chicago for support on immigration operations, and Federal Reserve Governor Lsa Cook has sued the administration to overturn her firing. Additionally, a federal judge in Florida has refused to pause the closure of the immigration detention center known as Alligator Alcatraz. The U.S. economy rebounded in the second quarter, but private investment dropped significantly. Consumer spending was stronger, but the impact of Trump's trade war fallout remains a concern.
