## Article summary
A tragic shooting occurred at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a Mass marking the first week of school at the adjacent Annunciation Catholic School. Two children were killed, and 18 others were injured. The shooter, identified as Robin Westman, 23, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Authorities revealed that Westman acted alone, motivated by a desire for notoriety, and left behind hundreds of pages of notes expressing hate toward multiple groups. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. The shooter used a rifle, shotgun, and pistol, firing through the church windows. Community members are mourning the loss, with Mayor Jacob Frey calling for action to prevent similar gun violence. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison also expressed their condolences and emphasized the need for gun control measures to prevent such tragedies. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities reviewing extensive evidence.
