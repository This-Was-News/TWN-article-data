## Article summary
A federal judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Trump administration official Kar Lake overstepped in attempting to fire the director of Voice of America (VOA). The judge stated that Lake must have the backing of an advisory panel set up by Congress to remove the director, which is currently not possible due to the dismissal of most panel members by President Trump. VOA Director Michael Abramowitz's attempted removal was deemed illegal. Judge Royce C. Lamberth is overseeing lawsuits related to Lake's efforts to dismantle VOA and its parent agency. Abramowitz expressed gratitude for the ruling, emphasizing the importance of VOA's programming for U.S. security and influence. Under Lake, VOA has significantly reduced its operations and workforce. Lake plans to appeal the ruling, asserting the president's executive powers. The judge criticized Lake for not providing requested information and deemed her actions a waste of taxpayer money. The ruling rejected arguments about executive powers and the constitutionality of laws protecting VOA's independence. Congress had passed legislation to insulate VOA from political interference, but Trump dismissed most of the advisory board members shortly after his second term began.
