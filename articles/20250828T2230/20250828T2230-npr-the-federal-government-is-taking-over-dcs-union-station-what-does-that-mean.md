## Article summary
The federal government is taking over management of Washington, D.C.'s Union Station, a major transportation hub and national landmark it already owns. The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it will reclaim management, with changes expected to be formalized in September. Union Station serves multiple train lines and over 70,000 passengers daily, but officials have cited safety and maintenance concerns. Recent incidents, including a fatal shooting, have highlighted issues at the station. Despite a decline in violent crime citywide, Union Station has faced criticism for being unsafe. The DOT plans to address infrastructure needs, including roof repairs and security improvements, and aims to maximize retail revenue. The takeover has local support, with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser noting the station needs $8 billion in repairs. The DOT plans to focus on immediate needs before considering future expansion, potentially involving private investment.
