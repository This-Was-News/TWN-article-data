## Article summary
A man in Washington, D.C., was charged with a misdemeanor after a grand jury declined to indict him on a felony charge for throwing a sandwich at a federal agent. The incident was highlighted by the Trump administration to demonstrate aggressive prosecution of violence against law enforcement. The man, Sean Charles Dunn, was initially charged with felony assault, which carries up to eight years in prison, but the charge was reduced to simple assault, carrying up to one year. Dunn's case is part of a recent trend where grand juries in Washington have declined to return indictments in several cases, potentially indicating resident frustration with ongoing law enforcement operations. Dunn was seen in a viral video throwing the sandwich at an agent's chest and shouting, 'Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!' He was later arrested and released. It was revealed that Dunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department's criminal division but was swiftly fired. Another recent case involved a woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent, but three grand juries voted against indicting her, leading prosecutors to pursue a misdemeanor charge instead.
