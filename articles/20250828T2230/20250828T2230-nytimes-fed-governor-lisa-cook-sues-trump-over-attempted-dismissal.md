## Article summary
Lisa Cook, a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, has sued President Trump over her dismissal from the nation's central bank, arguing that her firing was unprecedented and illegal. Cook seeks to retain her position, claiming the White House lacks the authority to order her dismissal. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, describes her ouster as part of a political campaign to pressure the independent Fed into lowering interest rates. The legal battle could have significant implications for the future of the Fed, which Trump has criticized for months. Cook also named the Fed's Board of Governors and Chair Jerome H. Powell as defendants, citing their role in carrying out the president's orders. The Fed stated it would abide by any court decision, and Cook remains an active governor until the court rules. Cook initiated her legal campaign three days after Trump announced her dismissal on social media, alleging mortgage fraud. However, Cook has not been charged or convicted of any crime, and experts question the legality of Trump's actions, noting the unproven allegations and lack of due process.
