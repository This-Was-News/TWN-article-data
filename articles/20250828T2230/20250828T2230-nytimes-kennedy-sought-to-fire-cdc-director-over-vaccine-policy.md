## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health Secretary, summoned CDC Director Susan Monarez to his office in Washington to demand she fire career agency officials and support his advisors' recommendations on restricting access to proven vaccines or risk being fired herself. Monarez refused, leading to a standoff that paralyzed the health agency, which was already dealing with mass layoffs and a recent shooting. Top officials have quit, Monarez's future is uncertain, and President Trump has not publicly backed Kennedy. The White House press secretary, Karolne Leavtt, stated that Trump fired Monarez after she initially agreed to resign but then refused. Monarez's lawyers argued she would only leave if Trump personally instructed her to do so, emphasizing her commitment to protecting the public over serving a political agenda.
