## Article summary
The letter from the Trump Administration to Harvard University outlines a series of reforms required to maintain federal funding due to concerns over the university's adherence to civil rights laws and academic integrity. By August 2025, Harvard is expected to implement governance reforms that enhance accountability and reduce the influence of students and activist faculty. The administration demands merit-based hiring and admissions policies, eliminating preferences based on race or other identities, with regular audits by federal authorities. Additionally, reforms for international admissions aim to prevent the admission of students hostile to American values. The letter calls for an audit of faculty and programs that have shown bias, particularly against Jewish students, and mandates the cessation of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Harvard must also revamp its student discipline policies to ensure impartial enforcement and accountability for disruptive behavior. Transparency measures require regular reporting to the federal government on the progress of these reforms. The letter emphasizes the need for cooperation in restoring Harvard's commitment to scholarly excellence and civil rights. Overall, these provisions aim to reshape Harvard's governance and operational practices significantly.
