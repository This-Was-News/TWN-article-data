## Article summary
Senate Democrats are expressing strong opposition to the GENIUS Act, a cryptocurrency bill, amid concerns that it could benefit the Trump family's crypto business, World Liberty Financial. The bill had previously gained bipartisan support but faced scrutiny after reports indicated that it would enable the Trump family to profit from crypto trading, particularly following a significant deal involving a $2 billion deposit from an Emirati venture fund. Senators like Jeff Merkley and Elizabeth Warren have labeled the situation as a conflict of interest and corruption, urging their colleagues to reconsider their support for the legislation. Additionally, lawmakers raised concerns about the bill's lack of protections against money laundering and its potential to allow foreign firms to bypass regulations. A group of nine Democrats, including some who initially supported the bill, announced they would not back it without significant amendments. The controversy has also drawn attention from some Senate Republicans and crypto industry leaders, who are worried about Trump's influence on the sector. As negotiations continue, Trump remains unfazed, promoting his new cryptocurrency venture and holding fundraising events tied to the industry. The outcome of the GENIUS Act could have major implications for the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S.
