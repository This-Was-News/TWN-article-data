## Article summary
Faith Kipyegon from Kenya made an ambitious attempt to become the first woman to run a mile in under four minutes at the "Breaking4" event in Paris on June 26, 2025. Despite her strong performance and a personal best time of 4:06.91, she fell short of the milestone. The event, however, was classified as an exhibition, meaning her time would not count for an official record. Supported by 13 pacers, Kipyegon maintained a strong pace until the last half lap, ultimately collapsing at the finish line, where she was celebrated by her supporters. 

She expressed gratitude to the crowd and reflected on her effort, stating, "I've proven that it's possible," indicating her belief that the sub-four-minute mile is within reach for women. Kipyegon's preparation included custom spikes, an innovative speed suit, and a 3D-printed sports bra. Her previous accolades include winning gold in the 1,500 meters at the 2024 Olympics, adding to her impressive track record. The first sub-four-minute mile was achieved by Roger Bannister in 1954, a feat that has since become a benchmark in athletics. Kipyegon's attempt highlights the ongoing pursuit of this historic milestone in women's sports.
