## Article summary
The U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, initiated by President Trump, raises significant political implications as it contrasts with his pledge to end "forever wars." While Republicans generally support the action, some in Trump's base are wary of further Middle Eastern involvement. The full impact of the strike remains unclear, with the public demanding credible evidence of damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities amidst skepticism of government intelligence. Iran's likely retaliation poses risks, potentially heightening security concerns across the U.S. The strike complicates Trump's foreign policy approach, especially given his previous efforts for peace deals and negotiations with Iran. Questions arise about whether his shift in strategy was influenced by Israeli pressure or a lack of progress in diplomatic talks. While there are calls for congressional authorization for military action, bipartisan support for Trump diminishes the likelihood of substantial debate on the issue. Democrats face political risks if they challenge the legality of the strikes, especially if evidence shows significant damage to Iran's nuclear program. Ultimately, the situation tests Trump's "peace through strength" narrative as he navigates the remaining years of his presidency.
