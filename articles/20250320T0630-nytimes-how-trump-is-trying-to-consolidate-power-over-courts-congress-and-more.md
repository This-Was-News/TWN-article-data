The article discusses President Trump's efforts to consolidate power during his second term, emphasizing his expansive interpretation of presidential authority. Trump has made significant moves to control the judiciary, Congress, and various aspects of American society, leading to concerns about a constitutional crisis. He has called for the impeachment of judges questioning his deportation policies and has been accused of overstepping his executive powers by firing independent commissioners and attempting to shut down federal agencies.
