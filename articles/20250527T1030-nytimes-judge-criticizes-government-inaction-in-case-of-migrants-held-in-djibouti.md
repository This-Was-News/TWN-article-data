## Article summary
A federal judge, Brian E. Murphy, expressed frustration with the government's handling of a group of deportees held in Djibouti, emphasizing their lack of due process. He highlighted the logistical difficulties of conducting immigration proceedings on another continent and suggested that if remote proceedings are too challenging, the men could be returned to the U.S. Judge Murphy had previously ordered that six of the eight deportees be given a reasonable fear interview, but found that the government failed to provide adequate notice in a language they understood. A lawyer for the migrants reported that her team had not been granted phone access to them. The judge's criticism reflects his growing frustration with the government's delays in ensuring due process amidst ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and federal courts. The case is part of a class-action lawsuit addressing the rights of migrants facing deportation to third countries, including war-torn nations like South Sudan and Libya. The administration has made deals with several Central American countries to facilitate deportations. While all eight deportees have criminal histories, Judge Murphy underscored that this does not exempt them from due process rights. The situation remains unresolved as the government continues to navigate the complexities of these cases.
