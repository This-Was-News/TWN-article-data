## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has laid off many staff members responsible for handling public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as part of a significant workforce reduction. These cuts impact teams at major health agencies, including the CDC, FDA, and NIH, leading to concerns about increased backlogs and delays in processing public records requests. Critics argue that these layoffs contradict HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s promises of "radical transparency." The firings are expected to hinder public access to vital government documents, which are crucial for understanding federal health agency operations.

Legal experts warn that the reduction in FOIA staff will likely exacerbate existing delays in fulfilling records requests, as the offices were already understaffed. The cuts could lead to more litigation over access to public records, increasing scrutiny on how agencies comply with transparency laws. HHS has stated that it aims to streamline FOIA operations for efficiency, but many see this as a move that undermines openness. The situation raises alarms about the future of government transparency and public access to important health-related information.
