## Article summary
The Israeli Security Cabinet has approved a plan to expand the war by taking control of Gaza City, a decision against the military's recommendations. The goal is to achieve a decisive victory over Hamas and provide humanitarian aid to civilians outside combat zones. The plan does not explicitly state full control of the Gaza Strip, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed that intention. The cabinet also approved principles for ending the war, including disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing Gaza, and establishing an alternative civilian administration. The military has concerns about the plan, including the fitness of reservists and the responsibility of governing millions of Palestinians. Netanyahu has stated that Israel does not intend to maintain permanent control over Gaza but wants to transfer administration to Arab forces. Hamas has criticized Netanyahu's comments, accusing him of reversing the course of negotiations. The expansion of military action defies international pressure to end the nearly two-year war and address a hunger crisis in Gaza. The military believes it could seize the remaining parts of Gaza within months, but setting up a governance system similar to the West Bank would require up to five years of sustained combat. Opposition members and hostage families have cautioned against expanding military operations, fearing further civilian casualties and the potential execution of hostages by Hamas.
