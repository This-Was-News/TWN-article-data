## Article summary
"Inside the Collapse of the F.D.A." explores the turmoil facing the Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A.) under the leadership of Robert Califf, particularly in the wake of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s criticisms. As the F.D.A. grappled with public distrust fueled by misinformation, it faced significant challenges, including underfunding and inadequate resources. The agency's ability to regulate effectively was hampered by legal constraints and industry influence, leading to a complex dynamic where it struggled to protect public health. Following Kennedy's appointment as head of Health and Human Services, mass layoffs and chaotic restructuring ensued, undermining the F.D.A.'s operational capacity. Critics argued that the agency's authority was being eroded, with calls for stricter regulations overshadowed by a push for rapid approvals and industry favoritism. Transparency initiatives were sidelined, and the agency's credibility continued to decline as it faced accusations of being a "sock puppet" for the industry. The article highlights the historical context of the F.D.A.'s regulatory role, emphasizing the tension between public health and corporate interests. Ultimately, the piece conveys a sense of impending doom for the agency, suggesting that its foundational principles are being dismantled. Califf reflects on the loss of expertise and the potential long-term consequences of these changes, concluding that the F.D.A. as it once operated is effectively finished.
