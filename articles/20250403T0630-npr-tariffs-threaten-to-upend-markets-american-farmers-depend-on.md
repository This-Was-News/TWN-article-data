## Article summary
Tariffs imposed by President Trump are causing significant distress among American farmers, who largely rely on exports for their income. Farmers, like Vance Ehmke from Kansas, express that these tariffs lead to increased costs for essential supplies while lowering the prices of their products. The agricultural sector, which has already been facing economic pressures, is particularly vulnerable as tariffs threaten to diminish their competitiveness in global markets. More than 20% of farm income comes from exports, and retaliatory tariffs are expected to further reduce demand for U.S. agricultural products.

Trade associations warn that losing market share can have long-term consequences, as building trading relationships takes decades. Farmers are concerned that countries affected by U.S. tariffs may turn to competitors like Brazil and Argentina for their needs. While some farmers hold out hope that Trump’s negotiation skills will open new markets, recent tariffs on goods from Vietnam and the Philippines could hinder these efforts. During previous trade conflicts, the government provided substantial aid to farmers, but skepticism remains about future support amidst budget cuts. Overall, American farmers find themselves in a precarious position, balancing hope for negotiations against the harsh realities of trade tariffs.
