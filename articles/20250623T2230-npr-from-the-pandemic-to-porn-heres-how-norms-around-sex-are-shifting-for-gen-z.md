## Article summary
The article discusses shifting sexual norms for Gen Z, particularly in light of events like the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. Journalist Carter Sherman, in her book _The Second Coming: Sex and the Next Generation's Fight Over its Future_, reveals that Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations, influenced by factors such as the internet, social media, and the pandemic. Sherman highlights that sex education has regressed to an abstinence-only model, limiting comprehensive discussions on consent and sexual health. She notes that many young people have developed a complicated relationship with pornography, feeling it has distorted their understanding of sex. 

Additionally, the #MeToo movement has heightened awareness of sexual harassment and assault among young women, yet many feel anxious due to a lack of institutional support for addressing these issues. Young men, on the other hand, are reported to feel demonized by the movement and are increasingly leaning towards conservative views. The article underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of sexual dynamics, recognizing both the challenges faced by young women and the vulnerabilities of young men. Ultimately, Sherman calls for a forward-looking approach to sex education and societal norms.
