## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil on bail, potentially ending his 104 days of detention as the first pro-Palestinian campus protester arrested under the Trump administration. Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and U.S. permanent resident, missed significant life events, including the birth of his son and his graduation, while in custody. The judge, Michael E. Farbiarz, expressed concerns that Khalil's detention might be unconstitutional retaliation for his participation in demonstrations. Despite a ruling from a Louisiana immigration judge denying him asylum and bail, Farbiarz's decision highlights the government's failure to substantiate claims that Khalil posed a danger to the community or had ties to Hamas. Khalil's lawyers argue that the allegations against him, including misrepresentation of his employment history, are baseless. The ruling may signal a shift in the administration's campaign against pro-Palestinian speech, which has faced legal challenges. Khalil's wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, welcomed the ruling, emphasizing the emotional toll on their family. The government may still appeal the decision, but if upheld, Khalil could return to New York to be with his family while his immigration case proceeds.
