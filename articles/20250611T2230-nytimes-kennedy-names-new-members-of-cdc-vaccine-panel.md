## Article summary
RFK Jr. has announced the appointment of eight new members to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, following the dismissal of the previous 17 members. The announcement was made via social media, just two days after the firings. The new panel includes respected doctors and researchers, but also features two controversial figures, Martin Kulldorff and Dr. Robert Malone, who have been critical of the Biden administration's Covid vaccine policies. Kulldorff, a biostatistician and former Harvard professor, is known for opposing vaccine mandates and co-authoring the Great Barrington Declaration, which faced significant backlash from public health officials. Dr. Malone, who claims to have invented mRNA technology, gained notoriety for spreading controversial views on vaccines, particularly after his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. Kennedy emphasized that he would not appoint ideological anti-vaxxers to the panel. The appointments are expected to provoke strong reactions from pro-vaccine advocates. This situation is ongoing, and further updates are anticipated. Sheryl Gay Stolberg, a health policy reporter, is covering the story.
