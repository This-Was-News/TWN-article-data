## Article summary
Former Missouri Congressman Billy Long has been replaced as IRS Commissioner after less than two months in the role. The Trump administration confirmed his removal, which was first reported by the New York Times, but did not provide an immediate explanation. Long's departure surprised IRS staffers and continues a series of management shakeups at the agency. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting commissioner for the time being. Long, with little experience in tax administration, is expected to receive an ambassador's appointment to Iceland. He expressed excitement about his new role and commitment to advancing President Trump's agenda. The IRS has faced a tumultuous period, including layoffs of thousands of staffers and a controversial deal to share confidential taxpayer information with immigration officials. The agency is also preparing to implement sweeping changes to tax law from the recently passed GOP budget bill.
