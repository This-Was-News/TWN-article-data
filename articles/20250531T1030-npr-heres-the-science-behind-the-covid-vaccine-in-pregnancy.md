## Article summary
The article discusses the importance of COVID vaccination during pregnancy, amidst conflicting messages from political figures and health authorities. Pregnant women are considered a high-risk group for severe illness from COVID, with studies indicating they are more likely to experience complications compared to non-pregnant women. The article highlights the risks associated with COVID, including severe illness, hospitalization, and potential harm to the placenta, which can increase the risk of stillbirth and other pregnancy complications. 

Research shows that COVID vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines, are safe and effective for pregnant women, providing protection for both mothers and their newborns. Vaccinated mothers can pass antibodies to their babies, reducing the risk of severe illness in infants who are too young to be vaccinated. Recent data indicate that the majority of hospitalized infants with COVID had unvaccinated mothers. 

Despite the Trump administration's decision to remove the COVID vaccine from the recommended schedule for pregnant women, healthcare professionals continue to advocate for vaccination to protect both mothers and their babies. The article emphasizes the need for accessible vaccination, noting that out-of-pocket costs may deter some families. Ultimately, the message underscores the scientific consensus on the benefits of COVID vaccination during pregnancy.
