## Article summary
President Trump has imposed extensive tariffs on numerous countries since returning to office, with rates reaching as high as 50 percent. A federal appeals court recently ruled that many of these tariffs were implemented illegally, but they remain in place until mid-October. The latest tariffs, effective this week, include doubling tariffs on India to 50 percent and closing a loophole that allowed tariff-free imports under $800. Trump's strategy aims to reset global trade, increase federal revenue, and pressure businesses to manufacture domestically. Countries like Bolivia, Ecuador, and Vietnam face varying tariff rates, with some exemptions and penalties for transshipment. Preliminary trade deals with nations like South Korea and the European Union have set tariffs at 15 percent or higher. The U.S. has also imposed a 30 percent baseline tariff on Chinese imports, with potential for further increases. Additionally, Trump has targeted specific industries, such as aluminum, steel, and pharmaceuticals, with sector-specific tariffs, and is considering further tariffs on semiconductors and furniture.
