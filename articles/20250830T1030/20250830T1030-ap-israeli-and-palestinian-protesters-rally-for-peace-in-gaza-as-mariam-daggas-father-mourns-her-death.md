## Article summary
In Nazareth, Israeli and Palestinian activists rallied for peace in Gaza, wearing press stickers to symbolize journalism and protest the killing of nearly 200 journalists in the conflict. Among the victims was Maram Dagga, a 33-year-old freelance journalist for The Associated Press, who was killed when Israeli forces struck Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Dagga and other journalists had been based at the hospital since the war began on October 7, 2023, following a Hamas attack inside Israel. The Israeli military claimed the hospital was targeted due to a suspected Hamas surveillance camera, but provided no evidence. Maram's father, Ryad, mourned her loss, recalling his shock upon hearing the news. Her sister, Nada, witnessed the last moments with Maram before the attack. Maram's brother, Mohamed, found her among the bodies and carried her to the operating room. The rally in Nazareth called for an end to the war and honored the journalists killed in the conflict.
