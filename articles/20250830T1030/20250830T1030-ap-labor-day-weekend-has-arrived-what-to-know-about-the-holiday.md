## Article summary
Labor Day, celebrated on the first Monday of September, marks the unofficial end of summer with activities like travel, barbecues, and shopping. The holiday has activist roots, with the first celebration in New York City in 1882, honoring workers during a time of declining quality of life for laborers. President Grover Cleveland made it a federal holiday in 1894, partly to appease workers after a violent strike. Barbecues have been a tradition since the beginning, evolving from large gatherings to family and friend get-togethers. Labor unions were controversial until the 1935 National Labor Relations Act granted private sector employees the right to unionize. Recently, there's been a resurgence in labor organizing and activism. The fashion rule against wearing white after Labor Day, originating from the Gilded Age, is largely ignored today. The holiday also marks a transition in fashion from summer to more formal attire. Travel is expected to be high, with major destinations including Seattle, New York, and Orlando.
