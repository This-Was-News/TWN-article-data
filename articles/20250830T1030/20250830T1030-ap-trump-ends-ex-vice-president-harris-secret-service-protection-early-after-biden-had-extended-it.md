## Article summary
President Donald Trump has revoked former Vice President Kamala Harris' Secret Service protection, which was set to end next summer. Typically, former vice presidents receive protection for six months after leaving office, but President Joe Biden extended Harris' protection at her request. Trump, who defeated Harris in the recent presidential election, decided to end her protection early as she prepares for a book tour. A recent threat assessment found no credible evidence of a threat to Harris, leading the administration to conclude that her protection should not extend beyond the standard six-month period. Trump's decision to revoke protection has raised concerns among security experts, especially given the politically charged environment. Harris' protection was extended from six to 18 months by the Biden administration but will now end on Monday. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized Trump's decision, calling it an act of revenge and pledging to work with California Governor Gavin Newsom to ensure Harris' safety. Harris, a potential candidate for 2028, has been a prominent political figure, serving as a senator, California attorney general, and San Francisco district attorney. The decision comes amid heightened security concerns following recent assassination attempts on Trump.
