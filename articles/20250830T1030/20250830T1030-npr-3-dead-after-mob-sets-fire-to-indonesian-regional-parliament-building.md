## Article summary
A violent protest in Makassar, Indonesia, led to the burning of a local parliament building, resulting in three deaths and five hospitalizations. The protest was part of a wider movement against lawmakers' allowances and police brutality, sparked by the death of a food delivery driver, Affan Kurnawan, who was allegedly run over by a police armored vehicle. Protests also erupted in other cities, including Bandung and Surabaya, with buildings set ablaze and clashes between protesters and security forces. The protests, which began in Jakarta, were fueled by reports of excessive lawmaker allowances and rising living costs. Amnesty International criticized the government's handling of the protests, calling for the release of detained protesters and an end to the suppression of free speech. Authorities confirmed that seven police officers linked to Kurnawan's death have been detained for questioning.
