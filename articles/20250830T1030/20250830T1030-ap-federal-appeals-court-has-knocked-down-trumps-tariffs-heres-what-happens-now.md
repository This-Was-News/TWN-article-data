## Article summary
President Donald Trump has claimed broad authority to impose tariffs on foreign products, but a federal appeals court has ruled against him, stating that his declaration of national emergencies to justify sweeping import taxes exceeded his authority. The court's decision largely upheld a lower court's ruling but allowed the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. Trump's tariffs, imposed on nearly all U.S. trading partners, have caused market instability, business uncertainty, and fears of higher prices and slower economic growth. The court's decision centers on tariffs Trump imposed in April and earlier on China, Mexico, and Canada. Trump justified these tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, claiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to set tariffs, but lawmakers have gradually allowed presidents more authority. The court ruled that Congress did not intend to grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs. Trump plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that the decision could harm the U.S. Treasury, which has collected significant revenue from tariffs. The decision may also weaken Trump's negotiating strategy in future trade deals.
