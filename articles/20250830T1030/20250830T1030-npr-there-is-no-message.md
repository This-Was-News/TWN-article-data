## Article summary
A shooting at a Catholic church in Minneapolis left two children dead and 18 others wounded. The FBI initially suggested the attack was motivated by 'hate-filled ideology,' but analysts examining the shooter's online presence, Robn Westman, paint a more complex picture. Westman's writings and videos indicate a misanthropic worldview, a reverence for mass violence, and a desire for notoriety, rather than a coherent ideological motive. His materials show a mix of extremist influences, including both right-wing and left-wing views, as well as references to various mass killers and extremist movements. Analysts note that Westman's actions align with a growing trend of school shootings committed by individuals obsessed with mass killing. The shooter's mental health is also a complex factor, with self-reported depression and suicidal tendencies, though analysts caution against taking these claims at face value. The attack appears to be the work of Westman alone, but analysts suggest that online communities may have influenced his actions.
