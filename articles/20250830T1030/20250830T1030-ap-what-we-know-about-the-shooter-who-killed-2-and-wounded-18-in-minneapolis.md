## Article summary
A shooter, identified as Robin Westman, killed two children and injured 18 worshippers at a Catholic school in Minneapolis. Westman, a former student at the school, was described as quiet and resentful of school during his time there. Armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol, he fired over a hundred rounds into the church before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot. Authorities are investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. Westman legally purchased his weapons and had no arrest history. Police found heavily redacted documents related to mental health calls and criminal complaints involving Westman's family. Investigators are examining evidence, including online content and writings, to understand his motives. Westman's mother worked at the school, and his uncle expressed grief over the tragedy. Westman was referred to as transgender by federal officials, and his gender identity was noted in a 2020 name change petition. Online videos allegedly posted by Westman suggest he experienced depression and admired other acts of mass violence. The FBI is leading the investigation into the shooting.
