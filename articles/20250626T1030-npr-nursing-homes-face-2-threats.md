## Article summary
Nursing homes are facing significant challenges due to President Trump's Medicaid cuts and immigration policies, which threaten staffing and care quality. A notable example is Goodwin House Alexandria, where a substantial portion of staff are immigrants from Africa, essential for providing care to residents like Rev. Donald Goodness. The long-term care industry relies heavily on immigrant workers, who make up 28% of direct care employees. Recent policy changes have led to fears of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, causing anxiety among workers and potential staffing shortages. Additionally, proposed Medicaid spending cuts could further strain resources, as Medicaid is the primary payer for many nursing home residents. 

The industry is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated staffing issues and quality concerns. With a growing elderly population, demand for caregivers is expected to rise sharply. Goodwin House, known for its high staffing levels, highlights the commitment of immigrant workers who often stay longer and are dedicated to their roles. However, recent governmental actions, including the revocation of work permits for certain migrants, have heightened fears among foreign staff about their job security and the future of care for elderly residents. The situation raises critical questions about the sustainability of care in nursing homes amidst these policy challenges.
