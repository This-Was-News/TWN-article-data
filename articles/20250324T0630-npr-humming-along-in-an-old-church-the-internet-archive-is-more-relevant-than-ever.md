## Article summary
The Internet Archive, housed in a former Christian Science church in San Francisco, has gained prominence due to the Trump administration's removal of numerous federal web pages. Founded in 1996, this nonprofit serves as a digital library, preserving vast amounts of internet history, including government websites and cultural artifacts through its Wayback Machine. Following the recent political changes, the Archive has cataloged over 73,000 web pages that were deleted or altered, highlighting its role in safeguarding digital history. The organization faces challenges such as copyright lawsuits and cyberattacks but continues to draw increased public interest and support from researchers and journalists seeking lost information. 

Brewster Kahle, the Archive's founder, emphasizes the importance of preserving public health data and other crucial records, noting a significant uptick in users during this tumultuous period. The Archive's efforts are crucial in combating "link rot," as a substantial portion of web content becomes inaccessible over time. With a budget significantly smaller than that of similar institutions, the Internet Archive relies on donations and partnerships to maintain its operations. Despite ongoing threats, Kahle remains committed to transparency, showcasing the Archive's servers to the public as a reminder of the need to support such critical institutions.
