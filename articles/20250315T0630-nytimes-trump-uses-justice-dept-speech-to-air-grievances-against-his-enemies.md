## Article summary
In a recent speech at the Justice Department, President Trump expressed grievances against his political adversaries while asserting his control over the department. Initially framed as a policy address aimed at combating the perceived weaponization of the department under the Biden administration, Trump's remarks quickly devolved into personal attacks on specific lawyers and former prosecutors. He accused the previous leadership of attempting to destroy him and labeled President Biden as the head of a crime family.

Trump's speech, which lasted an hour, included a mix of policy themes and personal grievances, with him vowing to restore what he termed "fair, equal and impartial justice." He urged his political appointees to remain steadfast in enforcing his agenda despite criticism and hinted at new executive actions targeting those who prosecuted him. The event was marked by a rally-like atmosphere, showcasing Trump's influence over the Justice Department and a departure from traditional presidential decorum.

He also reiterated his commitment to fighting crime, particularly drug trafficking, and emphasized the need to appeal to drug users' vanity to combat fentanyl overdoses. Throughout the address, Trump praised allies within the department while condemning those who opposed him, reinforcing his narrative of a corrupt "deep state." The speech underscored Trump's view of the Justice Department as an instrument of his political agenda, rather than an independent entity.
