## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of newly imposed tariffs by President Trump on digital commerce companies, which had anticipated a successful year with multiple planned initial public offerings (I.P.O.s). Companies like Klarna, Chime, and StubHub have paused their I.P.O. plans due to market volatility resulting from these tariffs. Despite being digital platforms, these companies are indirectly affected as tariffs could reduce consumer spending on foreign goods, impacting their revenue from transaction fees. Analysts warn that prolonged tariff disputes could harm the entire retail industry, including major players like Amazon, which has seen its stock drop due to potential sales declines. Firms like Meta and Google are also at risk, as reduced ad spending from businesses could affect their revenues. While some companies may endure the disruption, others like Shopify, Klarna, and Stripe are more vulnerable, as their success is closely tied to the health of small businesses and online sales. Shopify has expressed support for addressing tariff loopholes but cautioned against policies that could harm small businesses. Overall, the tariffs are expected to create significant challenges for the digital commerce sector.
