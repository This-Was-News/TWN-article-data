## Article summary
Amid rising global tariff tensions, President Trump's recent imposition of tariffs on imports from key trading partners has significantly impacted international markets. The European Union swiftly retaliated with $28 billion in tariffs targeting U.S. goods, including bourbon and motorcycles, while Canada also introduced $20.6 billion in retaliatory measures. The U.K. opted for a more cautious approach, seeking to negotiate a bilateral trade deal without immediate retaliation. Mexico initially planned to impose tariffs but suspended those plans, aiming for diplomatic solutions. 

China has responded strategically, filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization and pledging to protect its interests. Brazil condemned the U.S. tariffs but has not retaliated immediately, focusing instead on maintaining trade discussions. South Korea declared an "emergency response mode" and is exploring countermeasures, including shifting production to the U.S. The situation has raised concerns about inflation and a potential recession in the U.S. economy as countries navigate the complexities of Trump's unpredictable trade policies.
