## Article summary
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the federal government will "aggressively" revoke visas for many Chinese students and increase scrutiny for future applicants. This decision, part of a broader effort to limit the number of international students from China, targets those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields, though Rubio did not specify which fields would be considered critical. The move could impact the approximately 280,000 Chinese students currently studying in the U.S., particularly those in technological areas where the U.S. and China are competitors. 

This initiative follows previous actions during the Trump administration, which saw thousands of Chinese students' visas revoked, especially in engineering fields with dual-use applications. The visa revocations are likely to further strain U.S.-China relations, already affected by trade tensions and competition in technology. The American higher education system may also suffer as many institutions rely on foreign students for tuition revenue. 

Earlier this year, the Trump administration terminated the records of around 1,800 international students, including Chinese citizens, from a national database, leading to legal challenges. Recently, the State Department paused visa interview signups to allow for social media screenings, causing anxiety among prospective Chinese students. As tensions rise, China's foreign ministry has urged the U.S. to protect the rights of international students, while the number of Chinese students in the U.S. has been declining, with India now surpassing China as the largest source of international students.
