## Article summary
The Sloviansk City Clinical Hospital in eastern Ukraine is home to the last functioning maternity ward in the Donetsk region, amidst ongoing Russian assaults. Young mother Anastasia, who has just given birth, expresses her desire to remain in her hometown despite the war, hoping for peace for her children. The hospital staff, operating at 90% capacity, continue to provide care despite the dangers, including missile strikes that have previously killed doctors. Many residents, like Dr. Valentina Hlushchenko, avoid discussing the divisive issue of regional allegiance to prevent conflict among families. 

As the population of Sloviansk has dwindled from 140,000 to around 57,000, families grapple with the realities of raising children in a war zone, with air raid sirens a constant threat. Pregnant Khrystyna Deshchenko and her husband are worried about the future and plan to relocate to a safer area. Local parents, like Dmytro Kluchnikov, emphasize their commitment to staying in Sloviansk, rejecting the idea of living under Russian control. The war has transformed community dynamics, fostering a strong sense of resilience and determination among residents to hold onto their homes despite the ever-present danger.
