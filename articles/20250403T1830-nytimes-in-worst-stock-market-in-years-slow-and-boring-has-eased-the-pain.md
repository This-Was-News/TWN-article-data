## Article summary
The U.S. stock market is facing significant declines, largely attributed to pessimism surrounding President Trump's tariffs. While domestic stock investments have suffered, diversified portfolios that include bonds and international stocks have shown more stability and even modest returns. Historical data from Morningstar reveals that traditional investments in retirement accounts outperformed major tech stocks during recent downturns. The new tariffs could potentially raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest level in 125 years, raising concerns among economists about their negative impact on the economy and consumers. Despite market gloom, some investors believe that current pessimism may present buying opportunities, although timing the market is fraught with risk. Diversified investment strategies, while not yielding the highest returns, help mitigate risk, especially for those nearing retirement. Long-term investors are encouraged to maintain a balanced portfolio of low-cost index funds and hold cash reserves for liquidity. Ultimately, the advice leans toward caution and maintaining a diversified investment approach amid turbulent market conditions.
