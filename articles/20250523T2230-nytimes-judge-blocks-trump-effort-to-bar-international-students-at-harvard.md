## Article summary
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to prevent international students from attending Harvard University, following a lawsuit filed by the university. The judge, Allison D. Burroughs, agreed that the administration's actions could cause immediate harm to Harvard, which relies heavily on its international student population. Harvard's president condemned the administration's move as unlawful, arguing it threatened the futures of thousands of students and undermined the university's mission. The lawsuit claimed the Trump administration was retaliating against Harvard for exercising its First Amendment rights and accused it of trying to erase a significant portion of the student body. The administration had revoked Harvard's certification to enroll international students and demanded extensive records related to student protest activities. Harvard complied with requests but was deemed insufficient by the Department of Homeland Security without clear justification. The broader academic community expressed shock at the federal government's actions, which could financially harm Harvard and disrupt the lives of many students. The judge set a hearing for May 29 to further address the case.
