## Article summary
The fentanyl crisis in the United States appears to be easing, with fatal overdoses declining in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data reveals a significant drop in drug-related deaths, with overall fatalities decreasing by approximately 25% from a peak of 114,000 in 2023 to just under 87,000. Experts attribute this decline to several factors, including increased availability of naloxone (Narcan), changes in drug use behavior, and a reduction in the potency of street fentanyl. In particular, the use of smaller quantities and a shift from injecting to smoking fentanyl have been observed among users.

Research indicates that the decline in overdose deaths may be sustainable, with some states experiencing reductions as early as 2021. Despite the positive trend, addiction experts caution against complacency, noting that many individuals surviving addiction still face significant health challenges. While fewer deaths are reported, the ongoing presence of potent and harmful substances like xylazine raises concerns about the overall safety of the drug supply. The situation highlights the need for continued healthcare and addiction treatment support for those affected. Overall, the decline in fatal overdoses offers hope for recovery and improved public health outcomes.
