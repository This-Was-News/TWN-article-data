## Article summary
Israel's total blockade of Gaza, lasting over 60 days, has led to catastrophic conditions for the region's two million residents, according to doctors and humanitarian groups. The blockade has halted all humanitarian aid, including food, fuel, and medicine, exacerbating an already dire situation that has persisted since Hamas took control in 2007. Health officials report that patients with treatable conditions are dying due to a lack of medicine, while preventable diseases are surging as access to clean water and food dwindles. The U.N. estimates that 91% of the population faces food insecurity, with many relying on charity kitchens for sustenance, often receiving minimal rations. Prices for available food have skyrocketed, leaving families to struggle with severe malnutrition. Hospitals are overwhelmed, with medical staff unable to provide adequate care due to shortages of essential supplies and medications. The blockade also severely impacts water production, with desalination plants operating at only 10% capacity, leading to increased health issues among the population. The Israeli government maintains its blockade is lawful and accuses Hamas of hoarding supplies, while aid organizations warn that the humanitarian crisis is on the verge of total collapse. Without urgent intervention, health officials fear more lives will be lost as conditions continue to deteriorate.
