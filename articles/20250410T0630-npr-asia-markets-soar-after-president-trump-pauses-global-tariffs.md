## Article summary
Asian markets experienced significant gains following President Trump's announcement to pause higher global tariffs, with Japan's Nikkei rising 9.1% and South Korea's Kospi increasing by 6.6%. Taiwan's composite index also spiked 9.25%, rebounding from a recent record drop. Despite these positive movements, investors remain cautious, particularly regarding China's response to the tariffs, as Trump has escalated tariffs on Chinese exports to 125%. In retaliation, China announced an 84% tariff on American goods. Analysts believe that Trump's higher tariffs on China may have a limited impact on its economy, as many Chinese businesses have low revenue exposure to the U.S. 

China's foreign ministry expressed readiness to continue the trade fight, emphasizing that trade wars yield no winners. Asian nations welcomed the 90-day suspension of higher tariffs, allowing them to negotiate trade deals more comfortably. Taiwan's foreign minister noted the opportunity for deeper economic cooperation with the U.S., while South Korea's trade envoy highlighted the potential for tariff rate discussions. Japan is also set to begin trade talks with the U.S. as part of this temporary reprieve.
