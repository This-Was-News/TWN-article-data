## Article summary
A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll reveals that majorities of Americans believe the state of the union is weak and that President Trump is hastily implementing changes without fully considering their consequences. The survey indicates that 53% of respondents view the state of the union as not strong, with 54% feeling the country is headed in the wrong direction. Independent voters are particularly concerned about Trump's cuts to federal programs and his foreign policy approach. While Trump's approval rating is higher than when he left office, it remains low at 45%, with only 34% of independents approving of his performance. 

Most Americans, 56%, think Trump is rushing changes, and 55% believe his cuts are harmful. Additionally, 60% see federal employees as essential, contrasting with Trump's efforts to streamline government. On specific issues, views are divided, with immigration receiving slightly more positive feedback than other areas. Respondents also expressed skepticism about Trump's adherence to court orders regarding his executive actions, with 58% lacking confidence in him to follow such rulings. Overall, the poll reflects a divided public, with sharp partisan differences in opinions regarding Trump's administration and policies.
