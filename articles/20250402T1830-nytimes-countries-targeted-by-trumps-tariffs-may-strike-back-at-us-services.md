## Article summary
The article discusses the potential backlash from countries targeted by President Trump's tariffs on goods, particularly focusing on U.S. services. While the U.S. has a trade deficit in goods, it enjoys a significant surplus in services, which constitutes a major part of its economy, generating over $1 trillion in exports. Countries like the European Union (E.U.) may retaliate by restricting U.S. service imports, utilizing tools like the Anti-Coercion Instrument to impose tariffs or other countermeasures. This could significantly impact American tech companies already facing scrutiny in Europe for various regulatory issues. The E.U. has a history of penalizing U.S. tech giants, which could intensify if trade tensions escalate. Britain, in contrast, aims to maintain a balanced approach, negotiating with the U.S. to avoid tariffs while addressing its own digital services tax that affects American companies. Analysts suggest that Britain might need to align more closely with either the U.S. or the E.U. in the future, as its current strategy of appeasement may not be sustainable. The overall situation reflects the complexity of international trade relations and the leverage that service sectors provide in negotiations.
