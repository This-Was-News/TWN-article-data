## Article summary
One year after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Secret Service faces scrutiny for its failures. The incident, which injured Trump and killed a rally attendee, exposed systemic issues within the agency, including poor communication, inadequate planning, and staffing problems. Investigations revealed that the Secret Service and local law enforcement did not coordinate effectively, leading to the shooter evading detection. Since the incident, the agency has implemented some changes, such as assigning a single person to oversee security operations, but challenges remain, including the need for better internal communication and threat information sharing. The threat level against Trump remains high, and while the Secret Service has seen a surge in recruitment, its preparedness for future threats is uncertain.
