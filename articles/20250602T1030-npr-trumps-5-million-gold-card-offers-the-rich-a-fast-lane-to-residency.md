## Article summary
The $5 million Gold Card, proposed by President Donald Trump, is attracting interest from wealthy foreigners seeking a fast track to U.S. residency. Immigration lawyers report a surge of inquiries, with clients from countries like India, Pakistan, and Egypt eager for a simplified immigration process. The card promises benefits such as favorable tax implications and potential VIP perks, although specifics remain unclear. Critics argue that the program resembles a donation rather than an investment, as it does not guarantee returns. Similar residency programs in other countries have faced scrutiny and shutdowns due to issues like money laundering and national security concerns. Trump claims the Gold Card will help reduce the national debt, yet experts predict sales will be limited to a few thousand cards. The initiative raises ethical questions, especially as the administration simultaneously enforces strict immigration policies for less affluent migrants. Supporters argue that the Gold Card could bolster the U.S. economy without raising taxes on citizens. However, legal experts question the administration's authority to implement such a program without congressional approval. The Gold Card concept has also sparked humor and parody on social media, highlighting its controversial nature.
