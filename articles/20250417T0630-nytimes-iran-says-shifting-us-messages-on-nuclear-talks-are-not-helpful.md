## Article summary
Iran has announced its intention to continue participating in nuclear talks with the United States, despite the mixed signals from the Trump administration regarding its demands. Iranian officials, including Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, emphasized the importance of private communications during negotiations, while acknowledging that the recent shifting U.S. messages were unhelpful. The upcoming talks in Rome will be a continuation of prior discussions, which both sides described as constructive. 

The Trump administration's stance has been inconsistent, with some officials advocating for the complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear program, while others suggest a cap on uranium enrichment similar to the 2015 nuclear deal. After the U.S. withdrawal from that agreement in 2018, Iran increased its uranium enrichment, claiming its program is for peaceful purposes. 

Public sentiment in Iran appears to favor negotiations with the U.S. to alleviate economic hardships, as many citizens are struggling with inflation and currency devaluation. In a recent virtual forum, Iranians expressed a desire for their government to prioritize negotiations to avoid conflict and improve their economic situation. Meanwhile, Iranian officials are set to discuss the negotiations further with Russian leaders.
