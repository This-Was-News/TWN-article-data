## Article summary
Five former Wisconsin women's basketball players have filed a lawsuit alleging psychological abuse by former coach Marisa Moseley and a lack of intervention by the university. The lawsuit names the Wisconsin Board of Regents, Moseley, and former associate athletic director Justin Doherty as defendants. The players claim Moseley manipulated their mental health, threatened scholarships and playing time, and discriminated against them based on disabilities. One player, Krystyna Ellew, was allegedly threatened with police involvement during a mental health episode. The complaint also states that several players and their parents reported abuse to Doherty, who retired earlier this year. The university is accused of adopting a laissez-faire approach rather than protecting the players. Wisconsin officials stated they were looking into previous allegations made by Tessa Towers on social media. The lawsuit alleges that Towers' mental health deteriorated under Moseley's treatment. Moseley resigned after a 13-16 season, and the program has since hired former Missouri coach Robin Pingeton.
