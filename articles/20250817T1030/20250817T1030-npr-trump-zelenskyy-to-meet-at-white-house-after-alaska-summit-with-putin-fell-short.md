## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House to discuss ending Russia's war on Ukraine, following a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska that did not yield a ceasefire. Trump stated that a peace agreement, rather than a ceasefire, is the best way to end the conflict. The Alaska summit was characterized by ceremonial elements but lacked concrete outcomes. Zelenskyy, excluded from the Alaska talks, accepted Trump's invitation to discuss peace efforts and emphasized the importance of European involvement. Russian President Putin described the Alaska meeting as useful and substantive, while European leaders expressed mixed reactions, with some criticizing the lack of progress. Senator Lindsey Graham suggested giving the peace talks more time, while others called for new sanctions against Russia.
