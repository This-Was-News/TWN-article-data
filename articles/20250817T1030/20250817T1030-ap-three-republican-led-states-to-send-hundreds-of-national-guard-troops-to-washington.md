## Article summary
Three Republican-led states—West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio—are deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to support President Donald Trump's federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. West Virginia will send 300 to 400 troops, South Carolina 200, and Ohio 150, escalating the federal intervention in the heavily Democratic city. This move follows Trump's executive order to federalize local police forces and activate about 800 D.C. National Guard members, drawing protests from activists who oppose the federal takeover. The governors of these states justified the deployments as a response to Trump's request, aiming to restore order in the nation's capital. Meanwhile, protesters marched to the White House, expressing concerns about Trump's overreach and the use of crime as a pretext for imposing his will. The surge in federal law enforcement has drawn mixed reactions from local residents and leaders, with some praising the efforts while others express alarm. The administration recently reversed an order to place the DEA head as an emergency police commissioner after legal challenges. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, urged residents to stand together against the federal takeover, emphasizing the importance of fighting for American democracy.
