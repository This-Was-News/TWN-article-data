The Old Fiddler's Convention, now in its 89th year, is a significant event for bluegrass and old-time music, held annually in Galax, Virginia. The six-day festival features competitions in various categories, including folk songs, bluegrass bands, and flatfoot dancing, attracting around 30,000 musicians, singers, and fans. Elle Massey, a 13-year-old from Ohio, is among the contestants, practicing gospel tunes with her family's support. The event is a melting pot of musical traditions, with instruments like the fiddle and banjo reflecting diverse cultural influences. Despite challenges such as lower post-pandemic attendance and competition from other festivals, the convention strives to keep old-time and bluegrass music alive, especially by nurturing young talent. Beyond the stage, the festival is a vibrant musical tailgate with jam sessions and camping. The convention is organized by the local Moose Lodge and offers a unique cultural experience, celebrating the rich history and community of mountain music.
