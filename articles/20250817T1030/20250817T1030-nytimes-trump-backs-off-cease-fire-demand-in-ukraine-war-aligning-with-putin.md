## Article summary
President Trump shifted his stance on the Ukraine war after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, now favoring a sweeping peace agreement over an immediate cease-fire, aligning with Putin's preference. This change could advantage Russia in negotiations and deviates from the strategy previously agreed upon by Trump, European allies, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump announced the shift on social media, stating that a peace agreement would be more effective than a cease-fire. He suggested that Zelensky should cede the eastern Donbas region to Russia, while Putin offered a cease-fire in the rest of Ukraine and a written promise not to attack again. European leaders responded cautiously, welcoming Trump's efforts but threatening increased economic penalties on Russia. Zelensky, who will visit the White House, emphasized the need for an immediate end to the killing, hinting at his preference for a cease-fire. Trump placed the responsibility for securing peace on Zelensky and European nations. European leaders reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and threatened further sanctions on Russia. The details of the agreement between Trump and Putin remain unclear, with their meeting ending earlier than expected. Trump highlighted his personal connection with Putin, rating their meeting highly. The article was reported by Jim Tankersley, Steven Erlanger, Steve Lohr, Ivan Nechepurenko, and Constant Méheut.
