## Article summary
Ukrainians fleeing Russia's attacks express outrage over the Alaska summit between President Trump and President Vladimir Putin. Valentyna Shevchenko, a 69-year-old who fled her home due to Russian offensives, criticizes the leaders for discussing Ukraine's fate without their involvement. Shevchenko, holding her poetry books, expresses her anger and frustration, wishing to confront the leaders. The summit, initially seen as a show of amiability, revealed discussions that could be detrimental to Ukraine. Trump's social media post and Fox News interview indicated a shift in support for Ukraine's position, suggesting territorial swaps and security guarantees. European officials reported that Putin demanded all of the eastern Donbas region, including areas still held by Ukrainian forces.
