## Article summary
Electricity prices in the U.S. are rising more than twice as fast as inflation, significantly impacting households, especially during the hot summer months. Ken Thomas and Al Salv, residents of Boca Raton, Florida, share their struggles with high electricity bills, which can exceed $400 and $500 respectively. Thomas has invested in energy-saving measures but still faces steep bills, while Salv, a senior on a fixed income, must choose between paying for electricity or medication. Florida Power & Light's proposed rate increase sparked opposition from AARP, leading to a tentative agreement that aims to keep bills low. Nationwide, rising electricity prices are driven by increased demand from data centers and the high cost of natural gas, which generates over 40% of U.S. electricity. The Energy Department projects continued price hikes, exacerbating challenges for low-income families who already struggle to pay their bills. The federal government's assistance for low-income energy costs is insufficient, and proposed budget cuts could worsen the situation. Despite these challenges, residents like Thomas recognize the necessity of reliable electricity but worry about affordability.
