## Article summary
Hundreds of protesters marched to the White House on August 16, 2025, to protest President Trump's attempted takeover of D.C.'s police department and the deployment of National Guard units. The protest began with a rally in DuPont Circle, where demonstrators chanted slogans against Trump's policies. The march continued to the White House, with police and National Park Service officers observing from a distance. Protesters expressed concerns about the ethical and legal implications of Trump's actions, highlighting the lack of checks and balances. The demonstration followed an attempt by Attorney General Pam Bond to appoint an emergency police commissioner, which was later withdrawn after a legal challenge. Protesters felt that preventing the appointment was not enough and called for more opposition to Trump's growing influence over D.C. police activities. Residents like John Smith and Catherine Ernst criticized Trump's exaggeration of crime in the city and emphasized the importance of resistance. Sam Goldman, a protest organizer, urged more people to voice their opposition to Trump's policies. The White House responded with a dismissive statement, while several Republican governors agreed to send National Guard troops to support Trump's crackdown, except for Vermont's governor, who denied the request.
