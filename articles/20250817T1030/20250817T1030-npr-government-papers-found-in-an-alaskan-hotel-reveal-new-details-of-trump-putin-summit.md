## Article summary
Government papers marked with U.S. State Department markings were found in an Alaskan hotel, revealing details about the August 15 summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The eight pages, accidentally left on a public printer, included meeting locations, times, and phone numbers of U.S. government employees. The documents outlined the sequence of meetings, including a ceremonial gift from Trump to Putin. The White House dismissed the papers as a lunch menu, while experts criticized the security lapse. The documents also listed names and phone numbers of U.S. and Russian officials, along with a seating chart for a luncheon honoring Putin. The luncheon, which was canceled, was intended to feature a three-course meal. The incident is the latest in a series of security breaches by officials in the Trump administration, highlighting concerns about professional judgment and competence.
