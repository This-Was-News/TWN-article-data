## Article summary
Protesters in Israel demanding a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas organized a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses. Police responded with water cannons and made dozens of arrests. Protesters fear further fighting could endanger the remaining hostages in Gaza, with only about 20 believed to be alive. Demonstrations occurred at various locations, including outside politicians' homes and military headquarters. Protesters handed out yellow ribbons, symbolizing the hostages, and called for an immediate deal to secure their release. Despite the strike, Israel's military pressure on Gaza continues, with reports of at least 17 aid-seekers killed. Meanwhile, Israel prepares for an invasion of Gaza City, aiming to destroy Hamas. The conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and severe humanitarian crises, with starvation and malnutrition at critical levels. Israel also conducted airstrikes in Yemen, targeting Houthi infrastructure in response to missile attacks. The situation remains tense, with no immediate end to the conflict in sight.
