## Article summary
Rose Hammond has long advocated for lowering the 55 mph speed limit on a busy road near her assisted living community, schools, and parks in Ohio. The 85% rule, based on outdated research, sets speed limits according to the 15th-fastest vehicle in free-flowing traffic. This rule has been widely accepted but is now being reconsidered due to increasing road deaths and changing urban landscapes. The Federal Highway Administration has clarified that the 85% rule is not mandatory, encouraging states to consider factors like road usage, pedestrian risk, and crash frequency. Some states and cities, like Madison and Seattle, have successfully lowered speed limits, reducing injuries and speeds. California, which heavily relies on the 85% rule, has made slight adjustments to allow local governments to set lower limits for safety. Advocates argue that the rule prioritizes cars over other road users, while motorist groups maintain it minimizes speed variation. Despite these shifts, Ohio's speed limits remain unchanged, with officials considering further modifications. Hammond remains discouraged by the lack of progress in lowering the speed limit on Mitchaw Road.
