## Article summary
President Donald Trump held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to push for a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, but ultimately dropped his demand in favor of pursuing a full peace accord, aligning with Putin's position. After discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump concluded that a peace agreement was the best way to end the conflict. The summit's details remain scarce, but it allowed Putin to reclaim his global standing and potentially extended Russia's time to advance its offensive in Ukraine. Critics argue Trump emerged weaker from the meeting, having failed to secure a ceasefire despite his persuasive efforts. Democrats expressed alarm over Trump's deferential treatment of Putin, calling for Congress to impose crushing sanctions on Russia. Trump has positioned himself as a peacemaker, citing past successes, but has struggled with the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict. Republican allies offered cautious optimism, while European observers viewed the summit as a diplomatic win for Putin and a setback for Trump.
