## Article summary
The stock markets experienced a significant decline as President Trump announced plans to impose high tariffs on China and other countries, leading to a 1.6 percent drop in the S&P 500. This decline continues a trend of losses since the tariff announcement, putting the index close to bear market territory, down 18.9 percent from its mid-February high. Despite an initial rally, investor confidence waned as the White House confirmed the tariffs would take effect imminently, raising taxes on Chinese goods to at least 104 percent. Economists warned that sustained trade policies could push the U.S. and global economies into recession. While there were signs of potential negotiations, the administration maintained its stance on tariffs. International markets reacted variably, with some gains in Japan and Europe, while Taiwan activated a stabilization fund amidst ongoing declines. Oil prices also fell, reflecting broader economic concerns. China responded to U.S. tariffs with its own, and government efforts to stabilize its markets included share buybacks by state-owned enterprises. Analysts noted that the economic implications of these tariffs could have far-reaching effects beyond market psychology.
