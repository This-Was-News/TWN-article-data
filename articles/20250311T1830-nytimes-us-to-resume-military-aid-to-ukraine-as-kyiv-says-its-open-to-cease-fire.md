## Article summary
The United States has agreed to resume military assistance to Ukraine following talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This decision comes after Ukraine expressed support for a 30-day cease-fire proposal from the Trump administration aimed at negotiations with Russia. The discussions in Jeddah marked a significant shift in momentum for cease-fire talks, which had stalled after a tense meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian leaders in Washington. The U.S. will lift its pause on intelligence sharing and military aid, which had been suspended after the White House confrontation.

Ukraine is prepared to accept the cease-fire proposal if Russia reciprocates, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing that the pressure is now on Russia to agree to the terms. The joint statement from the meetings also highlighted plans for a deal to develop Ukraine's critical mineral resources, which had been delayed due to previous tensions. Humanitarian relief efforts and prisoner exchanges were also discussed as part of the potential cease-fire arrangements.

Despite Ukraine's insistence on security guarantees, the joint statement did not indicate that these would be provided before implementing a cease-fire. Both nations recognized the bravery of the Ukrainian people in their defense and expressed a desire for lasting peace. The outcome of the talks leaves the onus on Russia to respond positively to the proposed cease-fire.
