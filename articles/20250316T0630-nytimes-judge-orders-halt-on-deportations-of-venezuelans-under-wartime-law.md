## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to stop deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798. This ruling came shortly after the Trump administration invoked the law to target Venezuelan citizens linked to the Tren de Aragua gang, allowing for summary deportations without hearings. The judge mandated the return of any planes that had already departed with immigrants under this order, although it was unclear if any had left. The ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, arguing that the law does not apply to Venezuelans since the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela. Tren de Aragua, a violent gang involved in human trafficking and drug dealing, has raised concerns among U.S. officials, contributing to the administration's deportation efforts. Venezuelan migrants have expressed that the gang's notoriety has led to stigma and discrimination against them in the U.S. The judge's ruling could set a precedent affecting the deportation of other immigrants without court hearings, depending on future legal interpretations. The administration's response included a claim that the judge was prioritizing the rights of alleged terrorists over public safety. This situation reflects ongoing tensions regarding immigration policy and national security under the Trump administration. The case may escalate to higher courts, potentially reaching the Supreme Court for a final decision.
