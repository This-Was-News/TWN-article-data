## Article summary
The article discusses the House Republican budget plan, which proposes significant tax cuts primarily benefiting wealthy Americans while simultaneously planning cuts to programs that assist low-income individuals. This approach has raised concerns among some Republicans about potentially alienating their working-class voter base, a demographic that contributed to their recent electoral successes. Democrats are leveraging this disconnect, criticizing the Republicans for favoring the rich at the expense of the poor.

The budget blueprint includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in spending reductions, alongside new funding for defense and border programs. Analysts argue that the proposed changes would be regressive, disproportionately aiding the wealthy while harming those reliant on government support, such as Medicaid. Current tax cuts, set to expire, would largely benefit high-income earners, with minimal gains for poorer Americans.

Additionally, Republicans are contemplating further tax cuts that would favor high-income individuals, including lifting caps on state and local tax deductions. Some Republicans express frustration with the party's traditional tax-cutting narrative, recognizing that it may no longer resonate with their evolving support base. The article highlights the ongoing debate within the GOP regarding the balance between tax reductions and necessary spending cuts, particularly in health care programs for the vulnerable.
