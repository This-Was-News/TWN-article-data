## Article summary
The article details the rise of World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm associated with Donald Trump and his family, highlighting its controversial business practices and potential conflicts of interest. Initially skeptical of cryptocurrencies, Trump shifted his stance and announced the launch of World Liberty shortly after his re-election, aiming to capitalize on the growing crypto market. The firm has engaged in questionable deals, including offering partnerships that require substantial payments for endorsements, which several companies deemed unethical. Despite this, World Liberty has successfully raised over $550 million, with a significant portion benefiting Trump's family due to their ownership stake. 

Trump has leveraged his presidential powers to influence cryptocurrency policy, including the creation of a federal crypto stockpile that boosted the value of World Liberty's holdings. The firm has attracted international investors, including those with past regulatory issues, suggesting a new avenue for foreign entities to gain favor with the Trump administration. Critics express concern over the intertwining of Trump's business interests and government policy, as he continues to promote cryptocurrency while benefiting personally from its success. The article underscores the unprecedented erosion of traditional boundaries between private enterprise and government in American history, as Trump solidifies his role as both a major player and policymaker in the crypto industry.
