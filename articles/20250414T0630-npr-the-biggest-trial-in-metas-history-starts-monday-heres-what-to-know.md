## Article summary
Meta's significant antitrust trial begins on Monday, prompted by a nearly six-year investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) into the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The trial, expected to last seven to eight weeks, will feature key witnesses, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg. The FTC argues that Meta's acquisitions were aimed at eliminating competition, alleging a "buy or bury" strategy to maintain monopoly power in the social media market. The government seeks to force Meta to divest both Instagram and WhatsApp to enhance competition among smaller companies.

Meta counters that it has always competed fairly and that the acquisitions were approved by regulators over a decade ago. The company asserts that a breakup would degrade the quality of its services, which have become integrated over the years. The case also carries political implications, with Zuckerberg's evolving relationship with Trump influencing the landscape of the trial. While a settlement during the trial remains a possibility, it is deemed unlikely by legal experts. Ultimately, the outcome could reshape the social media landscape, impacting users and competition in the industry.
