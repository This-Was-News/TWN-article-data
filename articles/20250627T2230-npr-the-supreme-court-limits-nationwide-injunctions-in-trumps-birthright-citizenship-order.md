## Article summary
The Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision to limit nationwide injunctions related to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The order states that children of parents who enter the U.S. illegally or on temporary visas are not entitled to automatic citizenship. The majority opinion, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, did not address the constitutionality of the order but focused on the authority of federal courts to issue universal injunctions. The Court asked lower courts to reconsider their broad rulings and imposed a 30-day delay on implementing Trump's order to allow for further legal challenges. Trump hailed the decision as a significant victory for constitutional principles and his immigration policy. Dissenting justices criticized the ruling for disregarding long-standing principles of equity. Immigrant rights groups and 22 states had previously sued over the executive order, leading to universal injunctions that blocked its enforcement. The ruling does not alter the historical understanding of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. Trump's interpretation of citizenship has been widely contested and contradicts a long-standing Supreme Court precedent.
