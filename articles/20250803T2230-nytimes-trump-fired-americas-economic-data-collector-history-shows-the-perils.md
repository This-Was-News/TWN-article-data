## Article summary
President Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after disliking weak jobs numbers, a move with few precedents in the history of U.S. economic statistics. Economists emphasize the importance of unbiased data for policymaking and democracy. Historical examples from Greece, China, and Argentina illustrate the severe consequences of political interference with government data, including economic crises and loss of international trust. Experts warn that Trump's action could signal a troubling shift towards politicizing economic data in the United States. The potential impact of this decision on the country's economic integrity and international standing remains uncertain.
