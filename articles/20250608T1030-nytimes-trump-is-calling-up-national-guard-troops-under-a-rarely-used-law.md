## Article summary
President Trump has activated 2,000 National Guard troops in California to address immigration protests, marking the first time since 1965 that a president has done so without a request from the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom. The decision, based on a specific federal law, allows the president to deploy National Guard forces during times of rebellion or danger to federal authority. Newsom criticized the action as inflammatory and detrimental to public trust. The White House justified the deployment by citing violent acts against federal agents, while local authorities did not report a need for federal assistance. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the Pentagon was mobilizing the troops but did not provide specifics on their assembly. The protests stem from opposition to federal immigration raids, with demonstrations occurring at various locations in California. Historically, the National Guard was last federalized in 1992 for riot control at the request of the governor. Trump's past comments indicate a willingness to use military force domestically, which has raised concerns among legal experts about the implications of such actions.
