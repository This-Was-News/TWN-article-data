## Article summary
The U.S. dollar has experienced its worst start to a year in over 50 years, primarily due to President Trump's trade policies, according to economist Kenneth Rogoff. The dollar has fallen by 10.8% since the beginning of the year, making travel abroad more expensive for Americans and increasing import costs. Concerns about the U.S. budget deficit and Trump's market strategies have contributed to a diminished confidence in the dollar. Rogoff notes that the current decline is reminiscent of the 1970s when Nixon ended the dollar's convertibility to gold. 

The volatility of the dollar is linked to Trump's actions, such as his criticisms of the Federal Reserve and tariff policies. While a weaker dollar can benefit exporters by making U.S. goods cheaper abroad, it negatively impacts individuals sending remittances to other countries. Rogoff emphasizes that the dollar's value reflects investors' perceptions of the U.S. economy's strength. He warns that the current situation may signal a significant shift in the global economic landscape, paralleling historical events from over half a century ago.
