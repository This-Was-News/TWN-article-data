## Article summary
Russell Brand has been charged with multiple counts of rape and sexual assault in the U.K., following allegations from four women made in the fall of 2023. The charges, announced by London's Metropolitan Police, cover incidents spanning over six years, with specific allegations dating back to 1999. Brand has denied the allegations, claiming that all interactions were consensual. He has not been arrested but was charged via a court summons and is scheduled to appear in court on May 2. The charges include one count of rape, one count of indecent assault, one count of oral rape, and two counts of sexual assault.

The allegations encompass a period during which Brand was active as a radio host and comedian, rising to fame with shows like _Big Brother's Big Mouth_. While his publisher paused projects following the allegations, Brand continues to engage with his audience through podcasting and social media. The police have stated that the women involved are receiving support from specially trained officers. Brand, now 50 years old, has also been known for promoting conspiracy theories and political causes in recent years.
