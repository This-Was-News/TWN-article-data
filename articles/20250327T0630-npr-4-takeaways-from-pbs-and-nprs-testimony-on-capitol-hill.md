## Article summary
NPR and PBS CEOs testified before a House subcommittee, defending their organizations against accusations of political bias from Republican lawmakers. The hearing, titled "Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable," focused on whether public broadcasting should continue to receive federal funding. Lawmakers expressed a lack of trust in NPR and PBS, claiming their coverage does not reflect the views of most Americans. Specific criticisms included a controversial incident involving a drag queen featured on a PBS website, which was quickly retracted by PBS CEO Paula Kerger. 

Republicans referenced a resignation by former NPR editor Uri Berliner, who criticized the network's progressive bias, leading to questions about the political affiliations of NPR staff. Democrats countered that the hearing was an attempt to suppress free speech and alternative views. They highlighted the importance of public broadcasting in providing emergency news, particularly in rural areas. Kerger shared a story from a rancher emphasizing PBS's role in education for his children. The hearing underscored the ongoing debate about the funding and perceived impartiality of public media.
