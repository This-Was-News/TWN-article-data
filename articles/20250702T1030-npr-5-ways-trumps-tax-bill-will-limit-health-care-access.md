## Article summary
Trump's tax bill, dubbed "One Big Beautiful Bill," proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act (ACA) funding, potentially increasing the number of uninsured Americans by nearly 12 million by 2034. The legislation introduces a Medicaid work requirement that could disqualify many enrollees who fail to meet new employment or reporting standards. Rural communities may face reduced health services and even hospital closures due to funding cuts, while ACA marketplace coverage could become more difficult to obtain and maintain, with stricter enrollment requirements and reduced subsidy extensions. Medicaid enrollees may incur higher out-of-pocket costs for medical visits, particularly if they earn above the federal poverty level. Furthermore, the bill could cut subsidies for hundreds of thousands of lawfully present immigrants, increasing marketplace premiums as younger, healthier individuals exit the system. Overall, the proposed changes threaten to reverse the health coverage gains achieved under previous administrations, impacting the financial stability of healthcare providers. The bill is awaiting approval from both the Senate and House before reaching the President's desk.
