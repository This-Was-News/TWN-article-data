## Article summary
The article discusses how the Republican-led Congress is willingly ceding power to President Trump, diminishing its own legislative influence. By supporting a stopgap spending bill, lawmakers have granted the White House significant control over federal spending, effectively transferring their constitutional powers. This trend is evident as Congress also relinquished its ability to challenge Trump's tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. Historically, Congress has been protective of its authority, but current Republican leaders appear more compliant, facilitating Trump's agenda without significant oversight. The article highlights a lack of congressional hearings or scrutiny regarding major administrative changes and firings by the Trump administration. Additionally, Republicans justify their actions by claiming that drastic measures are necessary to overcome bureaucratic resistance. Despite concerns about setting a dangerous precedent, GOP lawmakers seem unconcerned about the implications of their decisions. The article also notes that Democrats are frustrated by the Republicans' enabling of Trump's power grab, which they argue undermines congressional authority. Overall, the piece portrays a significant shift in the balance of power between Congress and the executive branch under the current Republican leadership.
