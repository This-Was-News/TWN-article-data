## Article summary
The webpage invites visitors to vote for their top 10 movies of the 21st century, following submissions from over 500 industry professionals, including prominent directors and actors like Julianne Moore and Pedro Almodóvar. Participants are encouraged to list feature-length films released since January 1, 2000, and are given the freedom to define "best" according to their personal criteria. A compilation of critics' favorites from the past 25 years is provided as a resource, but voters are not restricted to those titles. The initiative aims to gather diverse opinions on the best films of the century. Voters are reminded to return next week to view the Readers' 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century. The page emphasizes the excitement around the voting process and the anticipation of the results.
