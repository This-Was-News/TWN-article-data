The screening was officially sanctioned by Lucasfilm, which added to its allure, as many fans felt they were privy to a rare glimpse of the creator's original vision. Audience reactions highlighted a fresh and more tangible experience without the modern CGI enhancements, emphasizing the film's gritty realism and comedic timing. 

The screening also reignited discussions around iconic moments, such as the infamous "Han shot first" controversy. Overall, the event provided a nostalgic yet authentic experience for _Star Wars_ fans, reaffirming the film's cultural impact.
