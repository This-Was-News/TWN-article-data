## Article summary
The White House has directed federal agencies to disregard the economic damage from climate change when formulating regulations, except where legally mandated. This decision effectively halts the use of the social cost of carbon, a metric that quantifies the economic impact of carbon dioxide emissions, which had been utilized for over two decades. The Biden administration previously adjusted this cost to $190 per ton, while the Trump administration had reduced it to below $5 per ton. The current policy shift, articulated by Jeffrey B. Clark, questions the scientific consensus on pollution's role in climate change, suggesting uncertainties in impact assessments. Critics, including scientists and economists, argue that this stance disregards established science and could lead to policies based on subjective interpretations rather than factual evidence. The American Petroleum Institute supports limiting the social cost's application, arguing it burdens industries. This change is anticipated to facilitate the rollback of climate regulations and may prompt legal challenges regarding project approvals that overlook climate considerations. Overall, the new guidance signals a significant shift in federal climate policy, prioritizing industry interests over environmental impacts.
