## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, has been elected as the first American pope, stepping into a complex and divided landscape within the American Catholic Church. His ascension comes amid a notable rise of right-wing Catholicism in the U.S., particularly under President Trump, contrasting with the decline in the church's influence due to scandals and a more secular culture. Leo XIV is expected to align with Pope Francis's progressive priorities, focusing on social justice and immigration issues, which may put him at odds with conservative factions. The new pope's election is seen by many as a sign of maturity for the American church, which is now the fourth largest globally. While some right-wing media have expressed skepticism about his orthodoxy, leaders within the church view his selection as an opportunity for optimism and unity. The new pontiff, who has spent significant time abroad, is recognized as a figure who can bridge American concerns with a global perspective. His election is viewed as a potential turning point for dialogue within the church, emphasizing both listening and speaking out on important issues. Overall, Pope Leo XIV's leadership is anticipated to navigate the tensions of a fractured American church while maintaining a commitment to broader Catholic values.
