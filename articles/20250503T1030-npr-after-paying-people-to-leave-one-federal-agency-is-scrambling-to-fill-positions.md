## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is urgently seeking to fill 73 critical positions after a wave of deferred resignations, where employees left in exchange for pay and benefits through September. This situation arose as the Trump administration initiated significant cuts to the federal workforce, leaving remaining employees anxious about job security. Many who accepted the resignation offer did so out of fear of being laid off, leading to frustration when they saw their roles posted as open shortly after their departure. The agency is looking for various professionals, including scientists and veterinarians, to maintain its mission of protecting American agriculture.

Employees have expressed anger at the timing of the job postings, feeling misled about their job security. The government will effectively be paying two salaries for these positions until September, creating budgetary questions. APHIS has not clarified how the funding for these roles will be managed, given that most positions are funded through fees rather than congressional appropriations. The situation has prompted internal conflict, with some employees feeling overlooked and excluded from reassignment offers. Union representatives have criticized the lack of communication regarding these job changes, highlighting the need for transparency in the agency's restructuring efforts.
