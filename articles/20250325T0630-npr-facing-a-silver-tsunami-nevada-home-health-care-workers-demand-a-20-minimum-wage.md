## Article summary
Home health care workers in Nevada are advocating for an increase in their minimum wage from $16 to $20 per hour, driven by the growing demand for their services as the state's population ages. This request marks the second time in two years that caregivers have sought a wage hike, following a successful campaign in 2023 that raised their pay from between $10 and $12 an hour. Caregivers, primarily women and people of color, often struggle to make ends meet without health insurance, facing rising living costs. The push for higher wages aims not only to alleviate financial strain but also to reduce turnover rates, which improved following the last wage increase.

Support for the wage increase also comes from clients who rely on caregivers for essential daily tasks. The caregivers are also calling for extended hours of client coverage to better meet the needs of those they serve. Many caregivers, like Regina Brown-Ross and Irma Nunez, share personal experiences highlighting the importance and challenges of their work, emphasizing the need for dignity and respect in their profession. The Nevada legislature, currently controlled by Democrats, previously supported the wage increase but will need to approve the new request as part of the upcoming budget.
