## Article summary
The GOP megabill, set for a Senate vote, incorporates key elements of President Trump's domestic agenda, including tax cuts and increased funding for border security and defense. The Senate's updated version proposes a $5 trillion increase to the debt limit, surpassing the House's $4 trillion, and introduces changes to Medicaid, requiring able-bodied adults to work to qualify for benefits. Tax incentives in the bill include higher deductions for overtime and tip wages, an increased child tax credit, and a permanent expansion of the standard deduction. Both chambers allocate $46.5 billion for Trump's border wall and propose new immigration fees, though some provisions were altered by the Senate Parliamentarian. The bill also outlines reforms to SNAP, expanding work requirements and adjusting state costs for food assistance. In terms of student loans, the Senate plan replaces existing repayment options with a new standard plan while maintaining current Pell Grant enrollment rules. Additionally, it allocates funds for broadband access with stipulations against state regulation of artificial intelligence for ten years. Despite these provisions, internal GOP divisions persist, particularly regarding fiscal responsibility and social safety net cuts. The outcome hinges on the House's agreement, given its narrow majority.
