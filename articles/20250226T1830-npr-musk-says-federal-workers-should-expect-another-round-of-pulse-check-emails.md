## Article summary
Elon Musk announced that federal workers should anticipate another round of "pulse check" emails as part of an initiative to evaluate employee productivity. This follows a recent warning from President Trump, indicating that approximately 1 million federal employees who failed to respond to previous inquiries about their accomplishments might be at risk of job loss. Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency, emphasized the need to identify whether there are employees who do not exist or are not actively participating in their roles. He described the initial emails, which asked workers to detail their weekly contributions, as a basic check-in.

During a Cabinet meeting, Trump supported Musk's approach, noting that many federal workers had not replied and that further outreach was essential. Musk claimed that the government might be paying salaries to non-existent individuals, which he suggested could explain the lack of responses. The emails caused confusion and discontent among federal workers, with some Cabinet members advising against immediate replies. Musk acknowledged some errors made by his team in budget cuts, specifically mentioning the restoration of Ebola prevention efforts. Overall, the initiative aims to streamline government operations and reduce expenditure significantly.
