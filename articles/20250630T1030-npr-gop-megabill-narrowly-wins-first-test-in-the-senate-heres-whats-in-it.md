## Article summary
The GOP megabill has narrowly advanced in the Senate with a 51-49 vote, despite some Republican dissent. Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to pass the bill this week, aligning with President Trump's goal for a July 4 signing. The legislation includes significant tax incentives, such as increasing the child tax credit and allowing deductions for tip wages and overtime pay, while proposing a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling. Reforms for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid are also outlined, with stricter work requirements and state financial responsibilities. The Senate bill temporarily raises the state and local tax deduction cap and allocates funds for border security and rural hospitals. It proposes a new standard for student loan repayment and regulates artificial intelligence funding. The bill faces internal GOP divisions and will undergo extensive debate and amendments before a final vote. The outcome in the House remains uncertain due to its slim majority and differing priorities among members.
