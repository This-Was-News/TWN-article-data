## Article summary
President Trump has signed an executive order urging state and local governments to take a more active role in disaster preparedness, suggesting a potential reduction or elimination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). While Trump claims that states can effectively manage disaster response, experts argue that states lack the resources and infrastructure to handle such responsibilities independently. Currently, FEMA coordinates federal assistance during disasters, but states depend on federal funding and support for recovery efforts. Without FEMA, states would need to significantly increase their workforce to manage disaster response and recovery, which could lead to billions in unmanageable costs. 

As climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of disasters, the role of FEMA becomes even more crucial, as it helps states prepare and respond to emergencies. Critics of the Trump administration's approach emphasize that reducing federal support during a time of increasing disasters could exacerbate the challenges states face. Many states advocate for a partnership with FEMA rather than its dissolution, as they require federal resources for effective disaster management. The order also calls for a review of FEMA, with the aim of creating a "National Resilience Strategy" that shifts more financial responsibility to states. However, many states, especially smaller ones, may struggle to meet these new demands without adequate federal support.
