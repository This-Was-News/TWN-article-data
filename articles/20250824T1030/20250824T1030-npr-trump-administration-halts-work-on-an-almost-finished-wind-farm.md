## Article summary
The Trump administration has halted construction of the Revolution Wind farm, an almost-completed offshore wind project near Rhode Island, citing national security concerns. This move follows a broader pattern of actions targeting the renewable energy sector, including a moratorium on new offshore wind projects and new IRS guidance that complicates federal tax incentives for wind and solar projects. The Commerce Department is also investigating whether wind turbine imports pose a national security threat. Ørsted, one of the developers, is evaluating legal options to resolve the issue. The project, which began construction in 2023 and was set to start supplying power next year, has raised concerns about job disruptions and economic impacts. Industry analysts warn that limiting renewable energy development could drive up electricity prices. Critics argue that partisan politics are undermining sound energy policy and investor confidence. Earlier this year, the Interior Department halted work on another wind project, Empire Wind, near Long Island, citing rushed approvals by the previous administration. Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May, but the disruption led to significant financial losses for its developer, Equinor. Advocacy groups emphasize that these actions threaten jobs, economic investments, and progress toward national energy goals.
