## Article summary
This week's top global news includes famine in Gaza, escalated crackdowns in Washington, and political redistricting in Texas and California. Gaza is experiencing famine due to Israel's restrictions on food entry, though Israel disputes this claim. Meanwhile, Israel's defense minister warns of further destruction in Gaza unless Hamas disarms and releases hostages. In Washington, National Guard troops will now carry weapons as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime, homelessness, and illegal immigration, with over 600 arrests in the past two weeks. Texas is set to approve a new congressional map favoring Republicans, while California is calling a special election to counteract this by ensuring Democrats gain an equal number of extra seats. Additionally, some conservative Christians argue that empathy can lead to sin, the Cambridge Dictionary added the term 'tradwife,' a ship resembling a pelican may have military applications, and a Swedish church was relocated in a highly choreographed event. The week's top photos include giant panda cubs celebrating their birthday and Pakistan honoring a Sufi saint.
