## Article summary
The White House has criticized several artworks and exhibitions at the Smithsonian Institution, including a painting by Roberto Gonzalez titled 'Refugees Crossing the Border Wall into South Texas,' which depicts an immigrant family crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The White House newsletter argues that the artwork commemorates illegal border crossings, but Gonzalez defends his work as a depiction of reality rather than an endorsement. The Smithsonian has been directed to review and potentially remove content deemed divisive or ideologically driven. Other artists and scholars, such as Ibram X. Kendi and Amy Sherald, have also been targeted by the White House for their work addressing race, immigration, and LGBTQ+ issues. The Smithsonian has stated its commitment to remaining free from political influence, while some artists view the White House's actions as a badge of honor. The situation has sparked concerns about censorship and its impact on artistic expression and historical representation.
