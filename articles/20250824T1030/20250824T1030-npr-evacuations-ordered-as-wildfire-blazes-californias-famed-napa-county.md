## Article summary
Evacuation orders are in effect as wildfires, including the Pckett Fire, rage across California's Napa County and Oregon. The Pckett Fire has burned nearly 6,000 acres, with 11% contained, affecting 190 people under evacuation orders and 360 under warnings. The cause of the fire is unknown, but it is different from the devastating 2020 Glass Fire. Over 1,200 personnel, 80 fire engines, and seven helicopters are battling the blaze. Meanwhile, the Flat Fire in Oregon has scorched 3,300 acres, driven by heat and dry conditions, with some areas under immediate evacuation orders. Residents are urged to leave immediately, as emergency services may not be available. The cause of the Flat Fire is also under investigation.
