## Article summary
The article discusses the Trump administration's actions following the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, focusing on the purge of prosecutors who handled those cases. Michael Gordon, a highly regarded prosecutor, was abruptly fired despite his outstanding performance, likely due to his involvement in prosecuting January 6 defendants. The Trump Justice Department has dismissed or demoted over two dozen prosecutors, targeting those who worked on January 6 cases or other investigations involving Trump. The administration has also granted clemency to nearly 1,600 individuals charged in the largest criminal investigation in Justice Department history. The article highlights the political retaliation and the weaponization of the Justice Department for Trump's agenda, including investigating his political opponents. Prosecutors like Greg Rosen and Sara Levne faced similar fates, with Rosen dismantling the very section he created. The purge extended to other agencies, including the FBI, and has emboldened January 6 rioters to sue the government. Gordon, now suing the federal government, reflects on his abrupt dismissal and the dismantling of his career.
