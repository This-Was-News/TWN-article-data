## Article summary
The U.S. government plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a plea deal that would have sent him to Costa Rica instead. Garcia, who has lived in Maryland for years, was initially mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's ruling that he faced a well-founded fear of violence there. He was brought back to the U.S. in June and charged with human smuggling. Garcia's attorneys argue that the threat to deport him to Uganda is further evidence of vindictive prosecution. The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, where officers suspected smuggling but allowed Garcia to continue driving with only a warning. Garcia's case has become a focal point in President Donald Trump's immigration agenda. Despite assurances from Costa Rica, ICE informed Garcia's counsel of the intention to deport him to Uganda. Federal officials argue that Garcia can be deported because he entered the U.S. illegally and was deemed eligible for expulsion in 2019, though not to his native El Salvador. Garcia's lead attorney criticizes the government for using the immigration system to punish his client by sending him to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not speak the language.
