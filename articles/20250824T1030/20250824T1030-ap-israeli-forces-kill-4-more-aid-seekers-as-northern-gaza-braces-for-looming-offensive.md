## Article summary
Israeli forces killed four aid seekers on Sunday in a military zone south of Gaza City, an area frequently used by Palestinians to reach a food distribution point. The incident occurred near a site run by the Israel-backed American contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Witnesses reported indiscriminate gunfire, with some people falling after being shot. The deaths add to the growing toll of Palestinians killed while seeking food, as parts of the Gaza Strip face famine. The Israel military and GHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Over 2,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 13,500 wounded while seeking aid. The Gaza Health Ministry reported at least 62,686 Palestinians killed in the war, including 115 children from malnutrition. Israel denies there is hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation lies promoted by Hamas. Residents in Jabalya described enduring heavy explosions and living in constant fear as Israel intensifies operations. The upcoming military operation threatens the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza City, which Israel claims is still a Hamas stronghold.
