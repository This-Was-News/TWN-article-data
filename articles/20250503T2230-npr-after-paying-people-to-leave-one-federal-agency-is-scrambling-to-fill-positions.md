## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is facing challenges after paying employees to resign as part of a workforce reduction strategy. Following the departure of hundreds of employees who accepted deferred resignation offers, APHIS announced 73 critical job openings to internal candidates. This move has angered those who resigned, as they feel misled about job security. The agency is now responsible for funding two salaries: for the new hires and for those who left with pay until September. Employees expressed frustration over the lack of communication regarding job stability and the abrupt posting of positions after their resignations. Many felt pressured to resign due to fears of layoffs amid broader workforce cuts within the federal government. The union representing APHIS employees criticized the timing of the job postings and the lack of notice given to them. Despite these challenges, APHIS is moving forward with its hiring process, emphasizing the need to maintain critical operations. The situation highlights the tensions and uncertainties within federal employment amidst ongoing restructuring efforts.
