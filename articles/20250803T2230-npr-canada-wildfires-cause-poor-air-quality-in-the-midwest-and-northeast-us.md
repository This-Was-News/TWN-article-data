## Article summary
Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, with nearly 4,000 fires recorded this year. Smoke from these wildfires has significantly degraded air quality in several U.S. states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Minnesota is under its longest air quality alert since 2008, with conditions expected to remain severe for seven days. The smoke has caused health issues, including irritated eyes, coughing, and shortness of breath, with more severe impacts on sensitive individuals. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported over 700 active wildfires across Canada, with more than 500 burning out of control, primarily in Manitoba.
