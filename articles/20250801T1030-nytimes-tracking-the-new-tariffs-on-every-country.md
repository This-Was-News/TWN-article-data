## Article summary
President Trump has imposed new tariffs on imports from numerous U.S. trading partners, ranging from 15% to 50%, as part of an aggressive trade strategy aimed at reshaping global trade dynamics and boosting domestic production. The tariffs, set to take effect on August 7, target countries like Brazil (50%), India (25%), and others, with some exceptions for goods covered under existing trade agreements like the USMCA. Trump has also negotiated preliminary trade deals with several nations, including South Korea and the European Union, setting tariffs at 15% or higher in exchange for trade concessions and investment promises. The U.S. has a 30% baseline tariff on Chinese imports, with the potential for increases if no new deal is reached by the August 12 deadline. Additionally, Trump has imposed sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, and other critical imports, citing national security concerns under Section 232 of federal law.
