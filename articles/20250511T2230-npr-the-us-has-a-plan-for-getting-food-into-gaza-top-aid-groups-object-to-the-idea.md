## Article summary
The U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies into Gaza after a ten-week ban that has led to widespread hunger. This initiative, pressured by the Trump administration, aims to initially aid around 60% of Gaza's population, though key details such as management and funding remain unresolved. The plan involves a new distribution system where a private charity would set up four aid sites, limiting access to prevent Hamas from seizing supplies. Israeli officials support the proposal, emphasizing security concerns regarding aid diversion. However, major humanitarian organizations oppose the plan, arguing it violates fundamental humanitarian principles and undermines existing U.N. distribution systems. They claim it is designed as a military strategy to control aid and force Palestinians to relocate. Critics highlight ethical concerns about the proposed delivery methods, recalling past issues in conflict zones. The U.S. is still negotiating with aid professionals to finalize the program's structure. If a ceasefire deal is not reached, Israel plans to implement the aid strategy alongside intensified military operations.
