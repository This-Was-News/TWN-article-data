## Article summary
On July 4, President Trump signed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," a significant spending and tax legislation aimed at advancing his domestic policy agenda. The bill, which passed the House with a narrow vote of 218 to 214, fulfills key campaign promises, including making tax cuts from his first term permanent, but it also breaks his vow not to alter Medicaid benefits. The legislation represents a major shift in federal priorities, reallocating resources from social programs to tax cuts, immigration enforcement, and national defense, with an estimated $3.4 trillion increase in the deficit over ten years. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a record-breaking speech against the bill, labeling it "immoral" for its cuts to essential services. Trump defended the bill during the signing ceremony, dismissing Democratic criticisms as deceptive. The passage followed intense negotiations among House Republicans, with Trump actively pressuring lawmakers to support the bill. Despite the bill's controversial aspects, GOP leaders expressed optimism about its potential to strengthen the U.S. economy. The legislative process was marked by late-night discussions and a sense of urgency to meet the July 4 deadline set by Trump. The bill's implications for millions relying on Medicaid and other social programs have raised significant concerns among Democrats and advocacy groups.
