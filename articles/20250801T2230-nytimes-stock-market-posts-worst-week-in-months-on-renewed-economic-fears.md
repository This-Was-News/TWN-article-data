## Article summary
The stock market experienced its worst week in months due to renewed economic fears, triggered by weak labor market data and new tariffs announced by President Trump. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% on Friday and 2.4% for the week, marking one of its worst performances since Trump's initial tariffs in April. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected job growth in July and significant downward revisions for May and June, raising concerns about the economy's strength and the timing of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate cut. President Trump publicly questioned the accuracy of the job data, but this did little to alleviate investor concerns. The market volatility was reflected in a drop in 10-year Treasury yields and the dollar, with traders increasing bets on a September rate cut to over 90%.
