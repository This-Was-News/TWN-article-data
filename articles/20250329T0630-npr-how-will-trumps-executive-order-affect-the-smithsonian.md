## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of President Trump's executive order on the Smithsonian Institution, which includes various museums and research centers. The order, titled "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History," aims to eliminate what the administration considers "woke ideology" from cultural institutions, asserting that the Smithsonian promotes harmful narratives about American values. It specifically targets the Smithsonian and monuments overseen by the Department of the Interior, directing Vice President JD Vance to remove "divisive" content and prevent funding for programs that could divide Americans by race. The order also addresses the forthcoming American Women's History Museum, mandating that it does not recognize transgender women as women. Critics argue that the order misrepresents the Smithsonian's work as a leading research institution. While the Smithsonian is a public-private partnership receiving federal funds, its response to the executive order remains unclear, though it has previously closed its diversity office in compliance with earlier directives. The executive order ties future funding to adherence to its guidelines, raising concerns about the institution's independence.
