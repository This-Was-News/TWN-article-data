## Article summary
A motion by opposition parties to dissolve the Israeli Parliament failed, but it highlighted significant challenges for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government, revealing divisions within his coalition. Fifty-three members voted for the dissolution, including two from the ruling coalition, while 61 opposed it. The opposition aimed to exploit tensions over the exemption of ultra-Orthodox men from military service, a contentious issue that has gained urgency since the recent conflict in Gaza. Netanyahu negotiated a last-minute compromise with ultra-Orthodox leaders to avert a more severe crisis, but the underlying enlistment issue remains unresolved. The ultra-Orthodox parties have historically been exempt from military service, leading to public discontent over perceived inequalities in conscription. Netanyahu's coalition, formed in 2022, holds a majority but faces declining popularity amid frustrations over his handling of the recent Hamas attack. Analysts suggest that the opposition's attempts, despite failing, indicate Netanyahu's waning control over his coalition. The ultra-Orthodox parties are reluctant to dissolve the government due to the benefits they receive, making an early election unlikely. Ultimately, the situation presents a rare opportunity for the opposition to challenge Netanyahu's leadership.
