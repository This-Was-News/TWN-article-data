## Article summary
Elon Musk has mandated that federal workers summarize their weekly accomplishments via email, warning that failure to do so would be interpreted as a resignation. This directive, inspired by Musk's experience at Twitter, was communicated through an email from the Office of Personnel Management, which instructed employees to respond by Monday. The demand has created confusion and alarm among civil servants, especially following recent layoffs, with some agencies advising employees to hold off on responding. President Trump has supported Musk's aggressive approach to reforming the federal workforce, further intensifying the situation.

While some agency leaders welcomed Musk's initiative, others expressed concern over its legality and the potential intimidation it poses to employees. The American Federation of Government Employees criticized the demand, labeling it cruel and disrespectful, and indicated plans to challenge any unlawful terminations. Legal experts have voiced that there is no basis in civil service rules for Musk's demands, suggesting they are designed to intimidate workers.

Musk has acknowledged the similarities between his current tactics and those used during his Twitter takeover, asserting that a simple email response should suffice. The situation reflects a broader atmosphere of instability within the federal government, leaving many employees feeling anxious and uncertain about their job security.
