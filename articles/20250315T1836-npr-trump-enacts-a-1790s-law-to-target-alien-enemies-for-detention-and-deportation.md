## Article summary
President Trump has invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to target members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua for immediate detention and deportation. This seldom-used law allows the president to detain or deport nationals from enemy nations during wartime, marking only the fourth time it has been utilized in American history and the first since World War II. The directive enables the expedited removal of Venezuelan citizens aged 14 and older identified as gang members, bypassing the normal immigration court process and asylum claims. Trump's administration previously designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, which facilitated this action.

Legal experts express concerns about the implications of this move, noting that the law does not restrict its application to undocumented individuals or those with criminal records. There are fears that it could lead to broader deportations beyond the targeted group. The legality of invoking the act is uncertain, particularly regarding its application in peacetime and the definition of "invasion" as it relates to illegal immigration. Immigrant rights organizations are already preparing legal challenges, arguing that past efforts to apply wartime powers to immigration enforcement have failed in court. The situation remains fluid, with potential legal battles expected as the administration moves forward with its plans.
