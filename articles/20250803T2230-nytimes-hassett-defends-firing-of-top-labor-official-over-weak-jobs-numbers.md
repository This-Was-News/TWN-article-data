## Article summary
The Trump administration defended its aggressive trade policies and the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics head, Erka McEntarfer, citing concerns over job numbers and data reliability. Kevn Hassett, the White House National Economic Council director, insisted the administration was not "shooting the messenger" but declined to provide evidence supporting claims of data manipulation. The administration also defended new Medicaid work requirements, despite Democratic criticism that they would hinder access to healthcare for vulnerable populations. President Trump announced plans for a large-scale renovation of the White House, including a $200 million state ballroom, raising concerns among historic preservation experts. Additionally, the administration's immigration crackdown has intensified fears among Chinese migrants, many of whom fled political repression and are now considering leaving the U.S. or returning to China.
