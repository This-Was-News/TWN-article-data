## Article summary
Pulp has made a comeback after two decades with their new album, _More_, reflecting on themes of love, loss, and personal growth. Frontman Jarvis Cocker, who formed the band in 1978, discusses how his songwriting has evolved, now incorporating more fully-formed lyrics compared to his earlier, more spontaneous approach. The album was influenced by significant life events, including the deaths of Cocker's mother and bandmate Steve Mackey, and a tumultuous period in his marriage. Cocker emphasizes the importance of expressing genuine feelings in his music, moving away from traditional pop narratives of love and relationships that felt disingenuous to him.

He draws inspiration from iconic figures like Leonard Cohen, advocating for authenticity in artistic expression. Throughout his career, Cocker has blended various musical influences, resulting in a unique sound that resonates with fans who appreciate the specificity and detail in his lyrics. He acknowledges the ongoing connection with his audience, including younger fans who may not have been alive during Pulp's initial rise. Cocker sees pop music as a youthful experience that evokes excitement, and he aims to capture that magic in his work at the age of 61. Ultimately, _More_ serves as a reflection of Cocker's life journey, blending personal anecdotes with broader themes of human experience.
