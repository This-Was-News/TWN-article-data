## Article summary
A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing speedy deportations of undocumented migrants detained within the United States. This decision is a setback for the administration's efforts to expand the use of expedited removal, which allows for quick deportations without a court appearance. The judge, Ja Cobb, argued that the expanded use of expedited removal infringes on individuals' due process rights. The Trump administration had aimed to deport one million migrants annually during his second term. Previously, expedited removal was only applied to migrants within 100 miles of the border who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days. The judge's ruling does not question the constitutionality of expedited removal but insists on due process for those affected. The Department of Homeland Security had expanded expedited removal to include migrants who have been in the U.S. for less than two years. The judge had earlier blocked efforts to fast-track deportations of migrants who entered legally under humanitarian parole.
