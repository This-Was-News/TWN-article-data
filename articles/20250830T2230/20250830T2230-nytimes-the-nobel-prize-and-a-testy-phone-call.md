## Article summary
The relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has deteriorated due to a disagreement over the resolution of the India-Pakistan conflict. During a phone call on June 17, Trump claimed credit for ending the military escalation and hinted that Modi should nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Modi rejected Trump's involvement, stating that the cease-fire was a direct agreement between India and Pakistan. This disagreement, along with trade disputes, has strained their once-close relationship. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian imports, and Modi is expected to strengthen ties with China and Russia. The article highlights the clash between Trump's ego-driven diplomacy and Modi's strongman image, which relies on a tough stance against Pakistan. The U.S. tariffs are seen as punishment for India's refusal to acknowledge Trump's role in the cease-fire and its purchase of Russian oil. The rift has pushed India closer to U.S. adversaries and raised concerns about the future of U.S.-India relations.
