## Article summary
Drug deaths in the U.S. have significantly decreased since mid-2023, with the latest CDC data showing 77,648 fatal overdoses in the year ending March 2025, the lowest since at least March 2020. Despite this decline, President Donald Trump continues to emphasize fentanyl as a major threat, implementing policies like the 'Halt Fentanyl Act,' which imposes 10-year mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers. Trump has also threatened military action against Mexico, imposed tariffs based on claims about fentanyl trafficking, and falsely linked fentanyl to undocumented immigrants. His crime emergency campaign in Washington, D.C., aims to remove drug addicts from visible areas and pressure them into treatment, a strategy criticized by experts like Dr. Stephen Taylor, who describes addiction as a chronic illness. Critics worry that Republican cuts to health and addiction program funding could hinder progress. Meanwhile, states like West Virginia, California, Florida, and New York have seen significant reductions in drug deaths, with overall deaths decreasing by about one-third from the 2023 peak. Experts are studying the reasons behind this decline, attributing it to disruptions in fentanyl supply chains and improved healthcare and treatment for addiction. The latest CDC data also corrects an earlier report that suggested a slight increase in drug deaths, confirming a consistent decline since summer 2023.
