## Article summary
A Social Security whistleblower, Charles Borges, has resigned from his position as the agency's chief data officer after alleging that Department of Government Efficiency officials mishandled sensitive data of over 300 million Americans. Borges claimed that sensitive information, including health diagnoses, income, banking details, and personal biographic data, was uploaded to an unregulated cloud account, putting Americans at risk of identity theft and loss of vital benefits. He reported his concerns internally and to regulators but faced a hostile work environment, leading to his resignation. Borges's attorney stated that he could no longer work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience. The Government Accountability Project, representing Borges, posted his resignation letter online. The Social Security Administration declined to comment on the allegations. Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency, under President Donald Trump's administration, has faced scrutiny for its access to personal data across government agencies. Earlier this year, labor and retiree groups sued the SSA for allowing DOGE access to sensitive data, though a divided appeals panel recently decided that DOGE could access the information.
