## Article summary
Israel plans to halt or slow humanitarian aid to parts of northern Gaza as it expands its military offensive against Hamas. This decision follows the declaration of Gaza City as a combat zone and is expected to draw further condemnation as conditions worsen for Palestinians and remaining hostages. Israel will stop airdrops over Gaza City and reduce aid trucks as it prepares to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people south. The UN and partners state that recent measures fall short of the daily aid needed in Gaza. Displaced residents describe the area as unlivable, with no journalists present to document the situation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed the recovery of a hostage's remains, identified as Idan Stavi. Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with Israel believing 20 are still alive. Relatives of hostages fear the escalating offensive will further endanger them and rallied for a ceasefire deal. Israel has increased strikes on Gaza City's outskirts, where famine has been declared. The International Committee of the Red Cross warns that a mass evacuation would be impossible to execute safely. Recent strikes have killed civilians, including women and children, while Hamas condemns the attacks. Gaza's Health Ministry reports deaths from starvation and malnutrition, with a total of 63,371 Palestinians killed during the war.
