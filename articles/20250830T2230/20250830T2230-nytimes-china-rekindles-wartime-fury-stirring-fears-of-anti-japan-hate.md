## Article summary
China is experiencing a surge in popularity of World War II dramas about its fight against Japan, which are drawing large audiences and emotional responses. These films, including 'Dead to Rights,' depict historical events like the Nanjing Massacre and have sparked patriotic fervor among viewers. The government is using these films as part of a broader effort to rally the nation amid economic struggles, disillusioned youth, and rising tensions with the United States. The 80th anniversary of the war's end is being commemorated with a large military parade in Beijing, featuring advanced weaponry and attended by leaders from Russia and North Korea. The parade rehearsals involve thousands of soldiers and civilians, showcasing China's military strength. Additionally, government departments are holding events for war veterans, unveiling new memorials, and issuing commemorative coins and stamps. State broadcaster CCTV has produced specials on various war-related topics, and television channels are airing nearly 100 war-related films throughout the year.
