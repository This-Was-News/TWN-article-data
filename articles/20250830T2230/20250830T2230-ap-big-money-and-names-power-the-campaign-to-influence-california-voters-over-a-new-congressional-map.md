## Article summary
A heated campaign is underway in California to influence voters on a new congressional map ahead of the 2026 midterms. Supporters and opponents have each raised over $10 million, with total spending expected to exceed $100 million. High-profile figures like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin McCarthy are involved. The effort is part of a mid-decade redistricting trend, with Texas Republicans recently redrawing maps to favor their party. California's Democratic-controlled legislature approved a plan to strengthen Democratic districts and target Republican seats, with Governor Gavin Newsom framing it as a defense against President Donald Trump's agenda. Opposition groups, including Stop Sacramento's Power Grab and Protect Voters First, argue the plan is a Democratic power grab. Both sides are using TV ads, digital campaigns, and canvassing to sway voters. If approved, the new map will replace the existing one drawn by an independent commission and remain in effect until 2030. Legal challenges have been filed, but the California Supreme Court dismissed two lawsuits. Democrats aim to regain control of the U.S. House, while Republicans are eyeing gains in other states like Indiana and Florida.
