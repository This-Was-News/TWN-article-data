## Article summary
A walk through the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History reveals both the genius and cruelty of America, as President Donald Trump pushes for a more positive narrative. The museum showcases iconic items like the Star-Spangled Banner and Dorothy's ruby slippers, alongside exhibits highlighting slavery, Japanese American internment camps, and other dark chapters. Trump criticizes the museums for focusing on America's flaws rather than its successes, urging a shift towards pride and accomplishment. The museum, however, presents a complex history, including achievements in creativity, industry, and culture, as well as struggles with racism, inequality, and injustice. Exhibits explore themes like immigration, food justice, and Native American boarding schools, provoking thought on America's past and present. The museum's mission is to encourage visitors to think about fundamental questions of American identity and values, rather than providing definitive answers. As the nation approaches its 250th anniversary, the museum's role in preserving and interpreting history remains crucial, even as political pressures seek to influence its narrative.
