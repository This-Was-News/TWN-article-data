## Article summary
The U.S. Agency for Global Media, under the Trump administration, is eliminating over 500 jobs, including those at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent agency. Acting CEO Kar Lake announced the job cuts despite ongoing legal challenges. A federal judge recently blocked Lake from removing VOA Director Michael Abramowitz and ordered her to comply with court orders. The judge also scheduled a deposition for Lake by September 15. Lake stated that the agency will continue its mission and improve functionality after the reductions. Employees suing to block VOA's elimination criticized Lake's actions and await her deposition. In June, layoff notices were sent to over 600 employees, and Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave. The administration plans to retain some employees while cutting others. The agency oversees several international broadcasters, aiming to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.
