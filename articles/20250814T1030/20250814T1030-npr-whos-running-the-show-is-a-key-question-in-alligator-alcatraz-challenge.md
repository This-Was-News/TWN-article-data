## Article summary
The web page discusses a legal challenge to the 'Alligator Alcatraz' immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. The facility, completed in July 2025, is the subject of a lawsuit brought by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe, who argue that its construction and operation violate federal law, particularly the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The key question in the case is who is in control of the facility, with the Trump administration and Florida state lawyers providing conflicting information. The environmental groups and the tribe are seeking a preliminary injunction to shut down the facility, citing its impact on protected species, water quality, and the local ecosystem. The judge has issued a temporary restraining order on new construction and will rule on the injunction request soon. The facility, which can hold up to 5,000 detainees, is located within the Big Cypress National Preserve and has raised concerns about its environmental and human health impacts.
