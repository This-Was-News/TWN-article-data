## Article summary
President Trump is exerting unprecedented control over U.S. business, with corporate America largely staying silent. He has publicly attacked companies and executives, demanding concessions from even lesser-known figures. Recently, Trump announced a deal where the U.S. government would take a 15% share of Nvidia's H20 chip sales in China, setting a precedent for future revenue-sharing arrangements. This move has raised concerns among the business community, which traditionally favors free-market capitalism. Experts warn that Trump's actions resemble state capitalism, with decisions based on cronyism. Despite worries, many CEOs avoid public criticism, fearing Trump's retribution. Trump has also targeted other companies, like Intel and Goldman Sachs, demanding resignations and policy changes. Meanwhile, Trump is undermining the independence of institutions like the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Despite economic concerns, markets remain strong, and CEOs are reluctant to oppose Trump publicly. Experts predict that significant economic damage will be needed before business leaders feel empowered to speak out.
