## Article summary
A recent Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has reached a record low, with only 54% reporting alcohol consumption. This decline is attributed to growing awareness of alcohol's health risks, including increased chances of cancer, depression, and anxiety. Younger Americans, in particular, are less likely to drink, with only 50% of those aged 18 to 34 reporting alcohol use, compared to 56% of older adults. The shift is also influenced by changing social norms, the popularity of no-drinking challenges, and the rising cost of alcohol. Additionally, there is a notable gender divide, with women's alcohol use dropping more significantly than men's. Experts suggest that men and women may perceive different types of alcohol as more socially acceptable. Despite the decline in alcohol consumption, marijuana use has remained steady, though data shows varying trends among different age groups. Overall, experts predict that alcohol consumption will continue to decrease due to heightened public awareness of its health risks.
