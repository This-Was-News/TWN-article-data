## Article summary
In Florida, incarcerated youth like 15-year-old Cayden Gillespie struggle with online learning, which is required for their release. Cayden faced difficulties with online pre-algebra tests and lacked teacher support, leading to frustration and extended detention. Florida's juvenile justice system adopted online learning despite evidence of its failures during the pandemic. Students report challenges with accessibility, understanding, and lack of assistance, leading to behavioral issues and longer detentions. The shift to online learning removed in-person teachers, leaving students with minimal support. Letters from incarcerated students describe their struggles and frustration with the system. Cayden's family was shocked by the extended sentence, and his experience highlights the broader issues within the system. Other students, like Xaver Ncoll, face similar challenges, with behavioral incidents extending their detention. The system's reliance on online learning has led to increased arrests and interventions, raising concerns about its effectiveness. Despite therapy and family support, the lack of proper education has left students like Cayden and Jalen Wilkinson struggling to reintegrate into society.
