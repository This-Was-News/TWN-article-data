## Article summary
Israel's far-right finance minister announced a new settlement construction in the West Bank, which Palestinians and rights groups fear will prevent the establishment of a future Palestinian state by dividing the West Bank into two parts. The announcement coincides with many countries planning to recognize a Palestinian state in September. The finance minister stated that this development buries the idea of a Palestinian state. The E1 plan, which includes around 3,500 apartments, has been under consideration for over two decades but was frozen due to U.S. pressure. Final approval for the plan is expected next week, with construction potentially starting within a year. Rights groups condemned the plan, calling it deadly for the future of Israel and any chance of a peaceful two-state solution. Meanwhile, Palestinian authorities and Arab countries condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement about his attachment to the vision of a Greater Israel.
