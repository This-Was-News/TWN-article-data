## Article summary
Melania Trump's lawyer has demanded that Hunter Biden retract comments linking her to sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, threatening legal action if he does not. The comments were made during an interview with British journalist Andrew Callaghan, where Hunter Biden alleged that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump. The lawyer, Alejandro Brito, described the statements as false, defamatory, and extremely salacious, causing significant financial and reputational harm to the first lady. Hunter Biden's remarks were widely disseminated on social media and reported by outlets worldwide. He made the comments during a broader interview where he criticized elites and others in the Democratic Party. Melania Trump's legal threat mirrors her husband's aggressive use of litigation against critics. The Trumps have consistently stated they were introduced by Paolo Zampoll at a New York Fashion Week party in 1998. The letter, dated August 6, was first reported by Fox News Digital. Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
