## Article summary
A federal appeals court ruled that President Trump can continue to withhold billions in foreign aid approved by Congress. The decision allows the administration to freeze or terminate nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs. The court found that the plaintiffs, a group of international aid organizations, lacked legal standing to sue. The foreign aid freeze was initiated by Trump on his first day in office. The administration has criticized foreign aid spending as wasteful and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. A lower court had previously issued a preliminary injunction against the funding freeze, but the appeals court reversed this decision. The judges did not rule on the constitutionality of the fund terminations. Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson and Judge Gregory G. Katsas formed the majority, while Judge Florence Pan dissented, arguing that the decision undermines Congress's role. Mitchell Warren of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition condemned the ruling, stating it erodes Congress's authority and disregards lives both in the U.S. and globally.
