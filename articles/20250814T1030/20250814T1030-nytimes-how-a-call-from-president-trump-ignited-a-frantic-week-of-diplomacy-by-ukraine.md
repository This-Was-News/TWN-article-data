## Article summary
A call from President Trump to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignited a week of intense diplomacy. Zelensky, returning from the front lines in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, joined a pivotal call with Trump and other European leaders. Trump outlined Russia's proposal for a territorial exchange to end the war, which included Ukraine ceding land to Russia. This proposal raised concerns in Kyiv, as it challenged Ukraine's principles of addressing territorial issues only after a cease-fire and without Kyiv's involvement. After the call, Zelensky addressed the Ukrainian people, expressing optimism about a potential cease-fire but cautioning against deception in the details. The situation highlighted the delicate balance of diplomacy and the challenges of negotiating peace amid ongoing conflict.
