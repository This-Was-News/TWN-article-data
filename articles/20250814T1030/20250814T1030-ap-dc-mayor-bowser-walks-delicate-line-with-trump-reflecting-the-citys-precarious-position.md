## Article summary
DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is navigating a delicate situation as President Donald Trump deploys National Guard troops in the city to combat crime. Bowser has described Trump's actions as unsettling and unprecedented but has avoided harsh rhetoric, unlike other Democratic leaders. She acknowledges the limited home rule of DC, which allows federal intrusion, and focuses on the city's needs. Bowser's approach contrasts with her more antagonistic stance during Trump's first term. She has worked to avoid conflict, even tearing up Black Lives Matter letters after Republican pressure. The city's vulnerable position under federal control and Republican Congress adds complexity. DC Councilmember Christina Henderson suggests legal challenges are unlikely to succeed. Trump plans to seek extensions beyond the initial 30-day emergency period. Bowser aims to cooperate with the administration on shared priorities, such as improving public safety. Despite Trump's rhetoric, crime statistics show a significant drop in violent crime in Washington, DC.
