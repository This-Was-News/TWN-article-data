## Article summary
President Trump has deployed National Guard troops and federal agents to Washington, D.C., to address violent crime, taking control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police. While some residents welcome the increased resources, others view it as a power play. Ava, a business consultant from the U-Street neighborhood, feels her area is relatively safe despite recent shootings and disagrees with the president's portrayal of D.C. as highly dangerous. Although violent crime in D.C. hit a 30-year low last year and is down nearly 30% in Ward 1 this year, carjackings and other crimes remain a concern. In contrast, Ward 8, with higher poverty rates, has seen 38 homicides so far this year. Alca Cooper, a property manager, supports the deployment, feeling it provides a sense of security, while Joe McLean, a lawyer, believes it's a political move to control the majority-Black city. The deployment aims to address crime, but opinions on its effectiveness and intent vary among residents.
