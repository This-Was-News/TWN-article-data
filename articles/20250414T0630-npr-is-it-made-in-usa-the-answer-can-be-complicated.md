## Article summary
The label "Made in USA" can be complex due to intricate trade rules and manufacturing processes. For a product to qualify, it must undergo substantial transformation in the U.S., meaning its final assembly and a significant portion of manufacturing costs must occur domestically. However, not all components need to be sourced from the U.S. For instance, foreign parts can be included as long as they do not substantially alter the product's identity. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) specifies that simple assembly does not qualify for "Assembled in USA" claims.

In the food sector, country-of-origin labeling for products like pork and beef has been complicated by trade agreements, leading to the repeal of previous labeling requirements. This means that meat can be labeled as U.S. products even if they were raised and processed in other countries. While many consumers prefer clear labeling indicating domestic production, the reality is that sourcing and manufacturing practices often blur these lines. Overall, consumers should be cautious and informed about the origins of the products they purchase.
