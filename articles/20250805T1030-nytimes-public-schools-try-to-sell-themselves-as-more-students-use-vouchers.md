## Article summary
Public schools across the U.S. are facing a significant enrollment crisis due to declining birth rates and increased competition from private school vouchers and homeschooling. In response, some school districts, such as those in Orlando, Newark, and Memphis, are hiring consultants to actively recruit students. These consultants, like Bran J. Stephens' firm Cassa K12, employ aggressive strategies to persuade parents to enroll their children in public schools. Federal data indicates that two-thirds of traditional public schools experienced enrollment declines between 2019 and 2023. This shift highlights the growing challenges and changing landscape of public education in the United States.
