## Article summary
Dr. Peter Marks, the top vaccine official at the FDA, resigned under pressure, criticizing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for promoting misinformation about vaccines. In his resignation letter, Marks expressed concern that Kennedy’s stance undermines public confidence in vaccines, which he deemed dangerous to public health. Marks, who led the FDA's vaccine program during the COVID-19 pandemic, felt that the new administration was not committed to transparency and truth. He highlighted the deadly consequences of misinformation, citing the resurgence of measles due to vaccine hesitancy. Marks had attempted to engage with Kennedy on vaccine safety but was rebuffed, leading him to feel that his efforts were futile. His departure is seen as a significant loss for the FDA, especially given his role in guiding vaccine approvals and emergency authorizations. Critics of Kennedy fear that his directives could roll back decades of vaccine safety policies. Marks emphasized the importance of scientific truth in public health, hoping for an end to the current administration's perceived assault on it. His resignation reflects broader tensions within the FDA regarding vaccine policy and safety.
