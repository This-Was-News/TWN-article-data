## Article summary
President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron met at the White House to discuss the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the third anniversary of Russia's invasion. The two leaders displayed a cordial relationship but had differing views on the conflict; Macron emphasized the need for security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement, while Trump failed to address what concessions Russia should make and reiterated his demand for a share of Ukraine's mineral wealth. Confusion arose within federal agencies following Elon Musk's directive for employees to summarize their accomplishments, which some Trump-appointed officials advised against. A federal judge raised concerns about the constitutionality of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, indicating potential legal challenges ahead. Meanwhile, Ukraine and the U.S. are nearing an agreement that would allow the U.S. to claim a share of Ukraine's mineral revenues, although it lacks the security guarantees Ukraine has been seeking. Macron criticized Trump's assertion that Ukraine started the war and reiterated that Russia is to blame. The meeting highlighted growing tensions between the U.S. and its European allies, as Trump suggested he might visit Moscow following a peace deal. Macron has been rallying European leaders to devise a unified strategy amid concerns over U.S. shifting priorities. The differences between the two leaders illustrate a deepening divide over the approach to the Ukraine crisis and the future of transatlantic relations.
