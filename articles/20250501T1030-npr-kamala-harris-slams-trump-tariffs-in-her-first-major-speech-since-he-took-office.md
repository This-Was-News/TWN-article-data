## Article summary
In her first major speech since leaving the White House, Kamala Harris criticized President Trump's tariff policies as "reckless" and a source of "absolute chaos," warning they could lead the country into recession. Speaking at a gala for Emerge America in San Francisco, she described the tariffs as the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history," affecting everyday costs and retirement accounts. Harris condemned Trump's agenda as self-serving and emphasized the importance of checks and balances in government, warning that their collapse could lead to a constitutional crisis. She expressed admiration for Americans standing up against Trump's administration, highlighting the efforts of various lawmakers who have opposed his policies. Harris, who has remained largely out of the public eye since January, hinted at a potential political future, considering a run for governor of California or a bid for the presidency in 2028. She concluded her remarks with a caution that conditions may worsen before improving, but expressed confidence in the readiness of her supporters to face challenges ahead.
