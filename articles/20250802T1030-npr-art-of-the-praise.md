## Article summary
World leaders have adopted a strategy of flattery towards President Trump, presenting him with honors and praise during their interactions. This shift in approach is evident in the actions of leaders like UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who have presented Trump with significant letters and nominations. The flattery appears to be a strategic move, as Trump has been more receptive and has achieved results, such as securing NATO members' pledges to increase defense spending. Trump's leadership style is described as personal and primal, with leaders needing to flatter him to secure deals. However, this approach has led to political consequences for some leaders, as Trump remains unpopular in many countries.
