## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Justice Department to provide a sworn declaration regarding the deportation of alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which occurred despite the judge's earlier order to halt the deportations. The case arose after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain and remove over 250 individuals linked to the gang. The judge's temporary restraining order was issued after planes had already taken off, leading to a debate about the timing and authority of oral versus written orders. Lawyers for civil rights groups argued that an oral order given before the written one should have been complied with, as it directed the government to turn planes around. Government officials contended that the order came too late to prevent deportations, as some planes were already out of U.S. airspace. The plaintiffs cited data showing that some flights were still airborne when the judge issued his written order. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that there are legal questions regarding the weight of verbal versus written orders, which will be addressed in court. The situation underscores ongoing tensions surrounding the use of wartime powers in immigration enforcement.
