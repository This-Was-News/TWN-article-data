## Article summary
President Trump announced a 90-day extension of the existing trade deal with Mexico, delaying tariffs as negotiations continue. The deal includes Mexico paying a 25% tariff on fentanyl, cars, and a 50% tariff on steel, aluminum, and copper, while also terminating non-tariff trade barriers. Trump described his conversation with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum as successful, though she did not confirm changes to non-tariff barriers. Sheinbaum stated that Mexico secured the best possible deal and emphasized their strategy of maintaining a cool head and defending their principles. The extension comes ahead of a broad trade deadline set by the Trump administration, which has caused uncertainty for countries and U.S. businesses planning for potential tariff changes.
