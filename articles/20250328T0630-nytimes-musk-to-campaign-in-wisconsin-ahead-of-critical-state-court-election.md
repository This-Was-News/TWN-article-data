## Article summary
Elon Musk is set to campaign in Wisconsin just before a crucial State Supreme Court election, indicating his continued involvement in political affairs. His visit will occur two days ahead of the vote, where he aims to support conservative candidate Brad Schimel. Musk announced his plans via social media, without detailing the specifics of his campaign event. He is employing strategies similar to those used during the 2024 presidential campaign, including issuing personal checks to individuals who sign a petition circulated by his super PAC. 

Additionally, Musk is offering conditional payouts for those who have already voted, a tactic that has raised legal questions. His super PAC has invested over $20 million in this campaign, although Musk has expressed uncertainty about Schimel's chances of winning. The election is being closely monitored as it could significantly impact various issues, including abortion policy and redistricting in Wisconsin. Musk's engagement highlights his influence and strategy in shaping political outcomes in key states.
