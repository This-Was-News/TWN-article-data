## Article summary
Vice President Vance recently visited Greenland, where he suggested that the territory would be better off as part of the United States rather than remaining under Danish governance. During his remarks at the U.S. military’s Pituffik Space Base, he criticized Denmark for underinvesting in Greenland and its security. Vance emphasized the right of Greenlanders to self-determination and stated that the U.S. would not forcibly annex the territory. His comments echoed President Trump's previous interest in acquiring Greenland, which has faced backlash from both Greenland and Denmark. Vance's visit included a scaled-down itinerary due to criticism from local leaders regarding a lack of communication from the U.S. administration.

While Vance argued for U.S. security benefits, polls indicate that most Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the United States, leading to significant protests against the idea. Trump also highlighted the strategic importance of Greenland for U.S. national security, particularly in light of military activities by China and Russia in the region. Despite the U.S. administration's interest, both Greenland and Denmark have reiterated that the territory is not for sale.
