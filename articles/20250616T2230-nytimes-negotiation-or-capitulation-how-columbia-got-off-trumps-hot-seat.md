## Article summary
The article discusses Columbia University's response to pressure from the Trump administration, which threatened to cut $400 million in federal grants unless the university complied with various demands, including altering its Middle Eastern studies department. Instead of capitulating completely, Columbia sought a middle ground by negotiating changes that allowed it to maintain some academic autonomy while addressing the administration's concerns. This approach contrasted sharply with Harvard's decision to fight the administration in court. Critics have accused Columbia of yielding to pressure, but the university has managed to limit its financial losses compared to Harvard. The article highlights ongoing tensions within Columbia's Middle Eastern studies department, which has faced accusations of anti-Israel bias. Following a controversial article by a professor, public outcry led to demands for faculty changes, echoing the administration's requests. Columbia's leaders opted for a broader review of all Middle Eastern programs rather than a specific receivership of the department. Despite challenges, the university continues to defend its academic freedom while navigating federal scrutiny. The article concludes with the university's hope to restore funding through ongoing discussions rather than litigation.
