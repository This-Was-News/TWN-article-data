## Article summary
President Trump has signed an executive order making English the official language of the United States, marking the first such designation in the nation's history. This order rescinds a policy from former President Bill Clinton that mandated assistance programs for individuals with limited English proficiency, although agencies may still choose to maintain these services. The order emphasizes that a nationally designated language promotes unity and a cohesive society, asserting that English is already the official language in over 30 states. However, it comes amid a growing population of non-English speakers, with about one in ten Americans now speaking a language other than English, a significant increase since 1980.

Critics, including advocacy groups, argue that this move undermines the diversity and inclusivity that have historically been strengths of the nation. They contend that the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech does not restrict expression to a single language. Roman Palomares, head of the League of United Latin American Citizens, stated that the declaration contradicts the vision of America's Founding Fathers, who embraced a multitude of voices and cultures. The executive order is seen as a fulfillment of Trump's campaign promise to promote a shared American culture and enhance civic engagement.
