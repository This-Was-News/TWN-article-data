## Article summary
A federal judge, James E. Boasberg, is scrutinizing the Trump administration's recent deportation flights of over 200 migrants to El Salvador, questioning whether the actions violated a court order for due process. The administration cited the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify the expulsions, but the judge expressed skepticism about the government's defense, particularly regarding the timing of the flights in relation to his order. The Justice Department's lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, maintained that no flights took off after the order was issued, but Judge Boasberg challenged this assertion. Meanwhile, Trump claimed that pardons issued by President Biden were invalid, suggesting they were signed without his knowledge using an autopen, a claim criticized as baseless. The administration's defiance of the court has led to heightened tensions, with the DOJ seeking to have Judge Boasberg removed from the case. The deportations have sparked backlash from human rights advocates and raised concerns about the treatment of transgender veterans following a recent directive from the V.A. that restricts gender-affirming care. The ongoing legal battle reflects a broader struggle between the executive branch and the judiciary over immigration policy and due process rights. Amidst this, Trump continues to assert his authority in various matters, including potential changes to the Kennedy Center's oversight. The situation illustrates the complexities and conflicts arising from the current administration's policies and legal challenges.
