## Article summary
The article examines the similarities between Donald Trump's recent tariff policies and Liz Truss's short-lived tax cuts in the UK. Both leaders implemented unorthodox economic strategies that caused significant market turmoil, yet Truss was quickly forced to retract her policies and resign, while Trump remains committed to his tariffs despite their negative impact. Analysts highlight the flexibility of Britain's parliamentary system, which allowed for Truss's swift removal, contrasting it with the current U.S. political landscape where Trump faces little pressure to change course. The article notes that Truss's tax cuts, aimed to stimulate the economy, were poorly timed amid rising inflation and energy prices, leading to a financial crisis in the UK. In contrast, Trump's tariffs have not yet triggered the same level of immediate market panic, although bond yields are starting to rise. Both leaders' policies reflect a broader crisis of competence, with economists questioning the credibility and strategic rationale behind their decisions. The piece underscores the potential long-term consequences of these economic experiments on their respective countries. Ultimately, it raises concerns about the stability of U.S. institutions in the face of Trump's assertive economic approach.
