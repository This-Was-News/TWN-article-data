## Article summary
California's Department of Cannabis Control is tasked with regulating the state's legal marijuana supply to ensure consumer safety amid the absence of federal oversight. The department inspects cannabis facilities, like Vibe Cultivators in Sacramento, to prevent contaminants such as mold, bacteria, and heavy metals from entering the market. Since its establishment in 2021, the department has faced challenges due to limited scientific research on cannabis safety, resulting in a patchwork of regulations across states. 

California has seen a rise in product recalls due to contamination issues, with 63 recalls in the past year alone. The cannabis industry largely supports these regulatory efforts, recognizing the importance of consumer safety. The department conducts rigorous testing of cannabis products, including edibles, to ensure accurate labeling and to prevent health risks associated with overconsumption. 

Despite the challenges, regulated cannabis is deemed safer than illicit products, which often contain illegal pesticides and other harmful substances. The department's laboratory plays a crucial role in testing for various contaminants and ensuring compliance with state regulations. Overall, the regulatory framework aims to protect consumers while supporting a growing legal cannabis market.
