## Article summary
President Trump claims he is powerless to return a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was deported due to an administrative error, despite having successfully retrieved a deported Iraqi immigrant, Muneer Subaihani, in a similar situation during his first term. Subaihani, who had lived in the U.S. for nearly 25 years, was mistakenly deported in 2018, but the government acknowledged its error and worked to bring him back, ultimately succeeding in January 2019. In contrast, the Trump administration has taken a different approach with Abrego Garcia, who is currently in a Salvadoran prison and accused of gang affiliation, despite no charges against him. U.S. officials assert that only El Salvador can decide on his return, while a federal judge criticized the administration for not complying with a Supreme Court order to facilitate his release. President Bukele of El Salvador has indicated he will not send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., complicating the situation further. The contrasting responses highlight a shift in the administration's handling of deportation cases, with advocates expressing concern over the political implications for affected families. Abrego Garcia's wife has voiced her distress over the situation, feeling caught in a political struggle. The outcome of Abrego Garcia's case remains uncertain, as legal proceedings continue.
