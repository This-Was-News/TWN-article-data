## Article summary
Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, criticized the Trump administration's response to a classified intelligence assessment indicating that U.S. airstrikes had only a limited impact on Iran's nuclear program. Quigley emphasized the importance of acknowledging the truth, stating that the president's ego should not interfere with addressing real threats. The intelligence report suggested that rather than "obliterating" Iran's nuclear capabilities, the strikes only delayed the program by a few months. The Trump administration contested this assessment, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claiming that the strikes resulted in total obliteration.

Quigley highlighted the difficulty in evaluating the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear infrastructure due to its complexity and mobility. He noted that the plan was never intended to completely destroy the facilities and emphasized the necessity of diplomacy to manage the situation. Quigley argued that abandoning diplomatic efforts has made the scenario more dangerous. He urged for renewed diplomatic initiatives, asserting that it is the only effective approach to addressing the challenges posed by Iran and its nuclear ambitions.
