## Article summary
Mike Musheinesh, CEO of Detroit Axle, relies heavily on Chinese auto parts but is growing increasingly anxious about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. Initially supportive of the tariffs as a necessary shake-up, Musheinesh now faces a crisis due to escalating costs, including a staggering 145 percent tariff on a recent shipment. Detroit Axle, which has transitioned from a small local business to a national player, has begun selling directly to consumers in Mexico and collaborating with a factory in Turkey to mitigate losses. The company has also started refurbishing old parts in a new Michigan facility, a change prompted by the tariffs. Musheinesh acknowledges the need for more domestic manufacturing but highlights the challenges, including infrastructure and expertise gaps in the U.S. He suggests that a potential solution could involve Chinese companies building factories in the U.S., which would create jobs and alleviate tariff issues. With trade negotiations stalled, he fears the long-term implications for his business, including the need to raise prices or reduce profit margins. Musheinesh remains hopeful for a resolution, emphasizing the importance of finding a workable compromise.
