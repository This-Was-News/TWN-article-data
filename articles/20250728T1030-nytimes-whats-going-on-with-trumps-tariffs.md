## Article summary
President Trump has initiated a global trade war with steep tariffs on imports from various countries, aiming to reset trade dynamics, generate federal revenue, and encourage domestic production. Recent agreements include a 15% tariff on EU goods, a similar rate on Japanese exports with $550 billion in U.S. investments, and a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports. China faces a 30% baseline tariff, with potential increases if no new deal is reached, while Canada and Mexico may see tariffs rise to 35% and 30% respectively on non-U.S.M.C.A.-covered goods starting August 1. Additional tariffs target specific industries like aluminum, steel, and foreign cars, with plans to impose duties on copper, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. These tariffs, paid by importing companies, risk raising prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, though Trump argues foreign producers will absorb the costs.
