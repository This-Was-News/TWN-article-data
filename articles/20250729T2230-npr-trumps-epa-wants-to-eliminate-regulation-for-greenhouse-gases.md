## Article summary
The Trump administration's EPA has proposed to overturn a 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, arguing it lacks legal authority to regulate them under the Clean Air Act. The move aims to eliminate climate pollution rules for cars and trucks, the largest source of direct greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. The proposal, announced by EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, faces opposition from climate advocates who plan to challenge it legally. The endangerment finding has been a cornerstone of U.S. climate action, enabling regulations on emissions from power plants, vehicles, and the oil and gas industry. The Trump administration contends the finding was established improperly and imposes unnecessary costs, despite the U.S. being the largest historical emitter of climate pollution.
