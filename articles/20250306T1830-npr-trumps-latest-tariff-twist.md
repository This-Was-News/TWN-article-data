## Article summary
In a recent turn of events, President Trump announced he would lift the 25% tariffs he imposed on goods from Mexico and Canada just two days prior. This decision came after market reactions to the tariffs caused significant downturns. Following discussions with U.S. automakers and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump decided to provide relief for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The temporary reprieve is set to last until at least April 2, with the possibility of extension if Mexico and Canada demonstrate progress in addressing fentanyl trafficking. 

Trump attributed the market fluctuations to external factors, downplaying their significance. The initial tariff implementation was intended to pressure neighboring countries to enhance border security and combat drug trafficking. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Sheinbaum actively engaged with Trump to negotiate terms, with Sheinbaum presenting data to counter the need for tariffs. The situation remains fluid, with upcoming reciprocal tariffs on goods from various countries still to be defined.
