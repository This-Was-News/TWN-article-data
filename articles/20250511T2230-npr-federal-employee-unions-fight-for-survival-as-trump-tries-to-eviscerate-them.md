## Article summary
Federal employee unions are facing significant challenges under the Trump administration, particularly regarding collective bargaining rights. Union leaders, like Anthony Lee of the NTEU Chapter 282, report that the administration has ignored established protocols, such as failing to provide advance notice of layoffs. Trump's executive order aimed at ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers has sparked multiple legal challenges, with a federal judge currently blocking it. Critics argue that collective bargaining serves as a necessary check on presidential power, ensuring that federal employees can advocate for their rights and working conditions. Historically, federal unions gained traction in the 1960s to help recruit skilled workers during labor shortages, and protections were later codified in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The current administration's stance suggests that these labor rights make federal workers less accountable, a claim that union representatives dispute. They argue that unions enhance government efficiency by managing employee concerns and disputes effectively. As the debate continues, union leaders worry about the potential loss of job stability and protections that have historically defined federal employment.
