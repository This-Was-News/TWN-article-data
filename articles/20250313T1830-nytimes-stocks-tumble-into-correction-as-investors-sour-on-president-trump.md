## Article summary
The S&P 500 has entered a correction, falling over 10% from its recent peak, primarily due to investor concerns regarding the economic policies of the Trump administration. This decline, marked by a 1.4% drop on Thursday, reflects growing pessimism about the impact of fluctuating tariffs and federal layoffs on consumer spending and business investment. Other major indexes, including the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000, have also experienced significant declines, indicating widespread market unease. Analysts suggest that the market is signaling fears of a potential recession, contrary to previous expectations for 2025.

Despite the downturn, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed market volatility, focusing instead on long-term economic growth. However, the administration's policies, particularly regarding tariffs, have been detrimental to sectors reliant on consumer spending, such as retail and airlines. Notably, companies like Dollar General and Delta Air Lines have reported decreased customer traffic and revised financial forecasts, respectively. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential government shutdowns further exacerbates investor anxiety. Overall, the current market environment is characterized by hesitance and a reassessment of company valuations amid fears of economic slowdown.
