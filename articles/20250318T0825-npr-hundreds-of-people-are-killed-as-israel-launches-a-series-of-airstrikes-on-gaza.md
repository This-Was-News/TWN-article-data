## Article summary
Israel has launched a significant wave of airstrikes on Gaza, resulting in over 410 deaths and numerous injuries, marking a potential resumption of war after a two-month ceasefire. The strikes were initiated in response to Hamas's refusal to release more hostages taken during the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz emphasized that the attacks targeted Hamas leadership to weaken the group's capabilities. The strikes have drawn criticism from Hamas, which accused the Israeli government of undermining the ceasefire and endangering hostages' lives.

Many families in Gaza are mourning the loss of loved ones, with reports of entire families being wiped out in the bombings. The Israeli military has instructed residents of certain neighborhoods to evacuate as it intensifies its offensive against what it labels as terrorist organizations. Negotiations for a new ceasefire had been ongoing, but Israel's demands for more hostage releases stalled the talks. This sudden escalation has left many in Gaza shocked and desperate for international intervention. The situation remains tense, with the prospect of further conflict looming as both sides prepare for the next phase of hostilities.
