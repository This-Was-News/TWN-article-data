## Article summary
Global stock markets experienced significant declines as President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to imposing steep tariffs, causing investor anxiety about a potential economic downturn. The S&P 500 was on the brink of entering a bear market, having already fallen 17.4% from its peak. Trump's announcement of new tariffs raised concerns about disruptions to global supply chains and inflation, prompting a sell-off in markets across Asia and Europe. Major indices in Hong Kong and Taiwan saw drops of over 12% and 10%, respectively, while oil prices fell to their lowest in nearly four years. In response to the turmoil, China's sovereign wealth fund increased its stock holdings to stabilize its markets, while analysts warned that U.S. tariffs could significantly hamper China's economic growth. The Federal Reserve faced pressure to adjust interest rates amidst rising inflation expectations linked to the tariffs, complicating its monetary policy decisions. As countries like South Korea and Japan voiced concerns and sought discussions with the U.S. over the tariffs, fears of a full-blown trade war escalated. Economists predicted a potential recession in the U.S., with forecasts suggesting a contraction in economic growth and rising unemployment rates. Overall, the market's volatility reflected deepening worries about the long-term impacts of Trump's aggressive trade policies.
