## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as Health and Human Services Secretary, has initiated a significant restructuring of the agency, aiming to eliminate what he calls an "alphabet soup" of health agencies. Since February, he has fired thousands of staff and canceled billions in grants, which has led to legal challenges and a temporary pause on staff cuts. Kennedy will testify before Congress to discuss President Trump's proposed budget, which would make these changes permanent. While some former HHS leaders support the need for cuts, others criticize the lack of strategy and transparency in Kennedy's approach. He has accused HHS staff of being influenced by industry interests and has linked the agency's growth to a rise in chronic diseases. Critics express concern that his rapid overhaul could undermine essential public health functions, including food safety inspections and disease prevention efforts. Kennedy's restructuring has resulted in significant job losses, which he acknowledges may lead to mistakes but believes are necessary for reform. Former secretaries emphasize the importance of careful planning and input from Congress during such changes to avoid negative impacts on public health services. Overall, Kennedy's vision for HHS includes a focus on addressing chronic disease epidemics while navigating the complexities of agency restructuring.
