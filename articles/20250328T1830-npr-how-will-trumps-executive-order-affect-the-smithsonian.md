## Article summary
Trump's recent executive order targets the Smithsonian Institution, aiming to eliminate what the administration views as "woke ideology" from cultural institutions. The order, titled "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History," claims that the Smithsonian promotes harmful narratives about American values. It directs the Smithsonian to remove "improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology" and specifically addresses the forthcoming American Women's History Museum, stating it should not recognize transgender women. The order also mandates the restoration of monuments and memorials deemed improperly altered in recent years, particularly in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests.

While the Smithsonian is a public-private partnership and not a federal agency, it receives federal funding, which ties compliance with the order to future financial support. The Smithsonian has not yet commented on the order, but previously closed its diversity office in response to an earlier executive order banning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs. Critics, including the executive director of the American Historical Association, argue that the order misrepresents the Smithsonian's work and undermines its integrity as a research institution. The implications of this executive order may significantly reshape the narrative and programming of the Smithsonian's exhibitions and educational efforts.
