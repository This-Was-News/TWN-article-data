## Article summary
China has suspended exports of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, impacting industries such as automotive, aerospace, semiconductors, and military contracting globally. This move is a response to increased tariffs imposed by the U.S. on April 2. The new export regulations require special licenses for the shipment of six heavy rare earth metals and magnets, which could take 45 days to implement. The halt in exports raises concerns about supply shortages, particularly for U.S. manufacturers reliant on these materials for electric motors, drones, and military applications. While some companies like American Elements have stockpiled inventory, many U.S. firms have minimal reserves, making them vulnerable to disruptions. China's dominance in this market is evident, as it produces 99% of heavy rare earth metals and 90% of rare earth magnets globally. The export restrictions affect not only the U.S. but also other countries like Japan and Germany, with enforcement varying among Chinese ports. The situation poses a risk to China's reputation as a reliable supplier if disruptions persist. Additionally, the resumption of mining operations near Longnan indicates a potential shift in China's approach to rare earth production amid ongoing trade tensions.
