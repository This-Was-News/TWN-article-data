## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of President Trump's tariffs on American importers, particularly focusing on Jacob Rothman, who oversees factories in China and has diversified production to Vietnam, India, and Cambodia. Despite his proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with tariffs, Rothman was caught off guard by a wave of new tariffs affecting multiple countries, including significant increases on imports from Vietnam and Cambodia. The tariffs have created chaos in global supply chains, leading to delays and rising consumer prices, as companies struggle to plan in such an unstable environment. Major brands like Apple and Walmart have shifted production to avoid tariffs, but the recent tariff actions threaten these strategies. Rothman faces a dilemma about potentially building factories in the U.S., given the high costs and uncertainties surrounding future trade policies. He questions the feasibility of such investments when tariffs on imported machinery are steep, and labor challenges persist. The article highlights the broader confusion and disruption in the market, with many businesses paralyzed and craving stability in the face of ongoing trade tensions. As Rothman navigates these challenges, he reflects on the historical context of tariffs on Cambodia and the potential long-term consequences for American manufacturing. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs raises concerns about the viability of U.S. factories compared to lower-wage countries.
