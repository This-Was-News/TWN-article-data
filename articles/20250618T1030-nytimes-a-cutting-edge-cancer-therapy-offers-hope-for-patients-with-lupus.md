## Article summary
Cutting-edge CAR T-cell therapy, initially developed for cancer treatment, shows promise for patients with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease. Ms. Le, diagnosed with lupus in 2016, participated in a clinical trial after exhausting conventional treatment options. The therapy modifies a patient's immune cells to target and eliminate misbehaving B cells, potentially offering a cure rather than just symptom management. Although the therapy is not yet FDA-approved for lupus, early results are encouraging, with many patients experiencing remission. Lupus affects primarily women and can lead to severe symptoms, including joint pain and organ damage. Dr. Schett, who has treated several lupus patients with this therapy, reports high remission rates, although the long-term effects and costs remain concerns. Patients like Janina Paech have regained normalcy in their lives post-treatment, allowing them to travel and engage in activities they previously could not. The treatment's risks include systemic inflammation and neurological symptoms, but the potential benefits have sparked hope among patients and physicians alike. As research continues, the medical community eagerly anticipates further developments in CAR T-cell therapy for lupus.
