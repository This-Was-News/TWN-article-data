## Article summary
A gunman, identified as Shane Devon Tamura, killed four people, including a New York City police officer, Didarul Islam, in a Midtown Manhattan office tower at 345 Park Avenue. The shooting occurred on Monday evening, with the gunman driving from Las Vegas to New York City, crossing several states before the attack. Officer Islam, a three-and-a-half-year veteran of the NYPD and an immigrant from Bangladesh, was the first to be shot and was working off-duty as a security guard. The gunman, who had a documented mental health history, shot several people in the lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, where he killed one more person and then fatally shot himself. The building, owned by Rudin Management, houses offices for the National Football League, the investment firm Blackstone, and other companies, and is located in a busy commercial district of Midtown Manhattan.
