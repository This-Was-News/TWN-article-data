## Article summary
The USDA has announced a $1 billion plan to address the egg crisis, primarily driven by fears of avian flu and significant price increases. Egg prices surged over 15% last month, leading to panic buying and empty store shelves. The USDA's strategy includes investing up to $500 million to enhance bio-safety measures at egg farms and $400 million to replace lost birds, although it may take up to a year for new hens to become productive. Additionally, the plan allocates $100 million to explore options for increasing the supply of imported eggs and potentially vaccinating domestic chickens, despite challenges this may pose for meat exports. Advocacy groups and some lawmakers are urging investigations into whether industry practices are contributing to the price spike, suggesting that factors beyond bird flu may be at play. The situation has prompted widespread public concern and discussion about egg affordability in the U.S.
