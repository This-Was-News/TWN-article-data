## Article summary
The article discusses the challenges in determining how many federal employees have left their jobs under President Trump's administration, which aims to reduce the size of the government workforce. Despite efforts to encourage resignations and implement mass layoffs, legal challenges have hampered these initiatives, leaving many employees in uncertainty regarding their employment status. For instance, Lauren Dueck, a former employee of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has not received formal termination paperwork despite multiple firings and reinstatements. The courts have intervened in several cases, pausing mass layoffs and requiring compliance with legal protocols for job reductions. 

Trump's administration has reported figures, such as 75,000 employees voluntarily leaving their jobs, but these numbers may be outdated, with estimates suggesting much higher resignations, particularly from the USDA. Many employees have felt pressured to resign due to fears of layoffs or loss of protections. The administration's new hiring guidelines are seen as a shift towards loyalty-based hiring practices, raising concerns about undermining the merit-based civil service system. Critics argue that these changes prioritize political alignment over qualifications, potentially leading to a less competent workforce. Overall, the article highlights the complexities and uncertainties surrounding federal employment under Trump's policies.
