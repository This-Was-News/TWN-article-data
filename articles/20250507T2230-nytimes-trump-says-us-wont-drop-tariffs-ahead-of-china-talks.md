## Article summary
President Trump announced that the U.S. would not lower high tariffs on Chinese goods ahead of upcoming trade talks, despite China's requests. During a press interaction, he firmly stated "No" when asked about reducing tariffs, which currently stand at a minimum of 145 percent. Trump suggested that it was China that sought the trade discussions, contradicting China's claim that the U.S. initiated the meeting. The talks, involving Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, are scheduled for this weekend in Geneva amid ongoing tensions between the two nations. High tariffs have negatively impacted businesses in both the U.S. and China, yet neither government wants to appear weak by requesting a meeting. Chinese officials express uncertainty regarding what policy changes might satisfy Trump, raising doubts about the possibility of a trade deal. Additionally, Trump emphasized the need for China to curb fentanyl shipments and criticized former President Biden for not adhering to a previous agreement with China. The remarks were made as Trump swore in David Perdue, the new ambassador to China, whom he described as a potential moderating influence on U.S.-China relations. The situation remains complex as both sides navigate their positions.
