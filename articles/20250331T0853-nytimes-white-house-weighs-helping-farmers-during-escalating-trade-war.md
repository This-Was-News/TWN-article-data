## Article summary
As President Trump prepares to impose significant tariffs globally, his administration is considering emergency aid for farmers who may suffer from retaliatory measures by trading partners. Discussions indicate an acknowledgment of potential financial harm to the agricultural sector, a crucial voter base for Trump. Previous aid packages during the 2018 trade war with China cost around $23 billion, and the current package could be even more expensive due to broader targets, including allies like Europe and Canada. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins mentioned the need for programs to mitigate potential economic disasters. However, the proposed bailout could conflict with Trump's protectionist policies aimed at revenue generation, particularly as he seeks to fund tax cuts. The tariffs are expected to impact consumer prices negatively, leading to decreased consumer confidence. Farmers are concerned that tariffs will lower commodity prices and reduce their competitiveness in foreign markets. The administration is exploring funding mechanisms through the Commodity Credit Corporation, but doubts remain about the U.S.D.A.'s capacity to support farmers without congressional intervention. Overall, the looming tariffs and potential aid raise complex economic and political challenges.
