## Article summary
Ukraine launched a significant drone attack on Moscow, marking the largest assault on the city since the onset of the war, as reported by Russian officials. The pre-dawn strikes targeted Moscow's oil refinery and other critical infrastructure, resulting in at least three fatalities and multiple injuries. In response, Russia claimed to have intercepted over 240 drones, although the Ukrainian military's assertions about the attack's targets remain unverified. The timing of the attack coincided with high-level talks between Ukraine and the U.S. in Saudi Arabia aimed at finding a resolution to the ongoing conflict.

Ukrainian officials proposed an air truce, suggesting that Ukraine would cease long-range strikes if Russia reciprocated. This proposal is supported by several European nations and is seen as a step towards building trust for broader negotiations. Despite the ongoing discussions, Russia has continued its drone strikes on Ukraine, which have resulted in civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure.

In recent weeks, the conflict has seen increased military actions from both sides, with Ukraine intensifying its strikes on Russian critical infrastructure. The attack on Moscow serves as a reminder of Ukraine's capacity to retaliate despite suffering significant losses. Additionally, the dynamics on the front lines are shifting, with reports of stalled Russian offensives and Ukrainian reinforcements being deployed to key areas.
