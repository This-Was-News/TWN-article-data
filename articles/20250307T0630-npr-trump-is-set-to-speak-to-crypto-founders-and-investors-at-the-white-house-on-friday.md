## Article summary
Trump is scheduled to speak at a cryptocurrency summit at the White House, marking a notable shift in the administration’s approach to crypto compared to previous administrations. The summit is set for Friday and will feature discussions on creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. Recently, Trump signed an executive order to establish a cryptocurrency strategic reserve, which will be funded with approximately 200,000 bitcoins seized through court actions. This initiative aims to explore "budget-neutral" ways to acquire additional bitcoin, creating what has been referred to as a "digital Fort Knox."

Trump has criticized the Biden administration's regulatory stance, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement actions against crypto. His administration has already begun rolling back investigations into crypto companies and has expressed intentions to position the U.S. as the "crypto capital of the planet." The event will be hosted by David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, alongside advisor Bo Hines. Experts believe this summit is a crucial step in re-evaluating the potential benefits of cryptocurrency against regulatory challenges.
