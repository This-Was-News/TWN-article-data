## Article summary
On March 10, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the cancellation of 83% of U.S. foreign aid contracts, totaling approximately 5,200 contracts after a six-week review. This decision follows Trump's directive to reassess foreign aid programs, which Rubio stated spent billions without serving U.S. national interests. The remaining contracts, about 1,000, will be managed by the State Department, which recently absorbed USAID. Concerns have arisen regarding the potential negative consequences of these cuts on global health, with warnings that they could lead to increased sickness and death, particularly among vulnerable populations. Estimates from USAID officials suggest that millions could suffer from malnutrition, malaria, and tuberculosis due to the halted aid programs. Health specialists and organizations have expressed alarm at the projected impacts, emphasizing that the cuts could have "fatal consequences for millions worldwide." The situation underscores the critical role of U.S. aid in combating diseases and supporting health initiatives globally. The review's expedited conclusion raises questions about the future of remaining programs and their effectiveness. Overall, the cuts signal a significant shift in U.S. foreign aid policy with potentially dire humanitarian implications.
