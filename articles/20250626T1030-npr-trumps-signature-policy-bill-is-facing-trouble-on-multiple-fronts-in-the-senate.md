## Article summary
Senate Republicans are under pressure to pass President Trump's domestic agenda bill by July 4, but they face significant challenges, particularly regarding funding for rural hospitals and tax provisions. A key issue is a proposed cut in the tax imposed on Medicaid providers, which critics argue would harm rural hospitals that rely on this funding. In response, the Senate Finance Committee has proposed a $15 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals, though some senators believe this amount is insufficient. Additionally, concerns persist about the overall impact of Medicaid changes and potential cuts in state funding for low-income patients. Fiscal conservatives are advocating for deeper spending cuts and caution against increasing the deficit. The Senate is also negotiating with House Republicans over the preservation of the state and local tax (SALT) break, which could complicate the bill's passage. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is working to address these divisions and believes that political pressure will ultimately unite Republicans. Despite the complexities, some senators are optimistic that a compromise can be reached. Ultimately, the success of the bill hinges on resolving these contentious issues in a timely manner.
