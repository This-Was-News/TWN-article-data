## Article summary
The article discusses Vice President JD Vance's response following a signal leak that revealed his participation in a secret chat regarding a military operation in Yemen. Instead of addressing the security breach, Vance's priority was to reaffirm his loyalty to President Trump after expressing dissent about the timing of the strike. In the leaked conversation, he questioned whether Trump understood the implications of the military action and expressed concerns about European nations benefiting from U.S. military efforts. Vance indicated he would support the consensus among his colleagues but was frustrated with the prospect of "bailing Europe out again." 

His team quickly moved to mitigate the fallout, emphasizing that Vance is fully aligned with Trump’s foreign policy. A spokesman stated that Vance's first priority is ensuring that the president is well-informed about internal discussions. The incident underscores the administration's emphasis on loyalty, as policy disagreements are not well-received. Despite his previous public support for Trump, this incident reveals Vance's internal struggles with certain policies. The article highlights the tension between maintaining loyalty and voicing legitimate concerns within the Trump administration.
