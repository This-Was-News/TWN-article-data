## Article summary
A recent NPR report highlights the resignation of 21 employees from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with one former employee, referred to as D.K., expressing concerns about the ethical implications of the new administration's actions. D.K. stated that the administration's changes could harm American citizens and compromise sensitive data. The resigning staff claimed that DOGE had fired technical experts and mishandled critical systems, leading to insecure data management, particularly regarding Social Security information. D.K. emphasized that their mission at the United States Digital Service was to improve government systems and serve the public, which clashed with DOGE's current direction. 

She noted that the tipping point for her resignation was witnessing the unjust firing of dedicated colleagues and recognizing that remaining in DOGE would legitimize actions that could breach ethical and legal standards. D.K. expressed fears that DOGE's activities could expose American data to unauthorized access and misuse, raising significant privacy concerns. The report underscores the broader implications of these resignations, suggesting a deeper conflict over the mission and practices within the government’s technological framework.
