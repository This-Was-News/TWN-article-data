## Article summary
The White House has rejected a finding by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that the Trump administration is unlawfully withholding funds designated for electric vehicle charging stations, as mandated by Congress. This $5 billion funding, part of the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, is said to be in violation of the Impoundment Control Act, which requires a formal process for halting spending. Trump's budget director, Russ Vought, dismissed the GAO's report as inconsequential and accused it of misunderstanding the law. A spokesperson from the Department of Transportation supported Vought's stance, stating the GAO report misinterpreted the legal framework. The conflict highlights ongoing tensions regarding government spending and the power of the purse, as Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act in response to past presidential funding disputes. Vought has previously argued the law is unconstitutional and has been involved in similar controversies during Trump's first term. Senator Patty Murray criticized Trump for blocking the funds, asserting that the Constitution clearly grants Congress the power to manage spending. The GAO is currently investigating other potential instances of impoundment under the Trump administration. Several states have already initiated lawsuits against the administration over the funding pause for electric vehicle initiatives. The situation is expected to escalate, potentially reaching the Supreme Court.
