## Article summary
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has identified a "serious safety issue" following a midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on January 29, which resulted in the deaths of all 67 individuals on both aircraft. NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy emphasized the need for urgent safety recommendations from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to address the risks posed by closely operating helicopters and commercial planes in the area. An analysis revealed frequent "close calls" in the airspace, with more than 15,000 incidents reported between 2021 and 2024. The January crash occurred at night, with the helicopter flying higher than its designated altitude. Families of the victims have expressed outrage over systemic failures in aviation safety, urging immediate reforms. Homendy criticized the FAA for not acting sooner based on accessible data. Congress has also called for prohibiting helicopter operations near DCA during certain runway usages. The NTSB's full investigation will take about a year, as they continue to explore factors contributing to the accident, including pilot visibility and air traffic control responsibilities.
