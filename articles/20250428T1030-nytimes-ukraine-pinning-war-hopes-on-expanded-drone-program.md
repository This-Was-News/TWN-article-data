## Article summary
The article discusses Ukraine's expanded drone program, aimed at sustaining its military efforts amid uncertainty regarding U.S. support in the ongoing war with Russia. Ukrainian soldiers are utilizing drones from a basement hideout, participating in the "Line of Drones" initiative, which emphasizes domestically assembled unmanned systems. This program is crucial as it serves as a contingency plan should peace talks falter or U.S. arms shipments cease. Drones are responsible for approximately 70% of casualties in the conflict, showcasing their significance on the battlefield. Ukraine's strategy focuses on using drones to limit direct confrontations and to disrupt Russian troop movements, especially in areas behind the front lines. The initiative is also a response to dwindling recruitment for traditional infantry roles, making drone operations a more viable alternative. The article notes the effectiveness of the drone program in stalling the Russian offensive and its potential to operate independently of U.S. aid, despite Ukraine's continued reliance on Western air defense systems. The costs of drones are relatively low compared to traditional artillery, highlighting their economic advantage. The piece concludes with insights from military analysts on the program's impact and the challenges faced by both sides in the war.
