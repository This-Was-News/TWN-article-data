## Article summary
"A Night in Kashmir, Caught Between India and Pakistan’s Fight" recounts a tense evening in Kashmir amid escalating military clashes between India and Pakistan. The narrative begins with a hopeful atmosphere as the author and friends observe lights from homes on both sides of the border, but an announcement from a mosque warns residents to stay indoors, signaling the imminent start of shelling. The author reflects on the broader context of conflict, highlighting a recent terrorist attack that exacerbated tensions and led to artillery battles impacting civilians in Kashmir.

As explosions begin, the author seeks refuge with friends in a safe house, where a group of men gathers while women and children shelter in a bunker. They cope with fear through prayer and communication, receiving news of casualties nearby. The shelling continues through the night, with reports of numerous deaths on both sides of the border. By morning, the author emerges to find a clear sky, but the trauma of the night lingers.

Despite a temporary cease-fire announced by India and Pakistan, the author expresses deep admiration for the resilience of the Kashmiri people, who endure constant danger yet persist in their daily lives.
