## Article summary
The U.S. deportation process is complex, often involving arrest, detention, a removal order, and eventual flight from the country, which can take months or years. Under President Trump, deportation efforts have intensified, with an emphasis on broadening the categories of individuals eligible for deportation and increasing law enforcement involvement. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has set aggressive arrest quotas and collaborated with other federal agencies to enhance enforcement. The legal landscape is complicated, as individuals may be deported without proof of a crime, and many face lengthy waits for court hearings due to a backlog of over 4 million cases. Deportation costs vary widely, influenced by factors such as detention duration and legal proceedings, with significant government budgets allocated to immigration enforcement. The system is described as overwhelmed and under-resourced, highlighting the need for comprehensive reform, which has historically faced challenges in Congress. Despite ongoing litigation, the Trump administration has sought to end protections for certain migrant groups, potentially leaving many at risk of deportation. Appeals against removal orders can extend the process significantly, often taking years to resolve. Ultimately, the current immigration system struggles to address modern migration challenges effectively.
