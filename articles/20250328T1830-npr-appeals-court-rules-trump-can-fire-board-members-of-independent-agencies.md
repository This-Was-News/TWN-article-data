## Article summary
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump can fire Democratic members of independent agencies, specifically the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board. In a 2-1 decision, the court determined that restrictions on the president's ability to remove officers from the executive branch are unconstitutional. This ruling paves the way for potential challenges to Trump's firings to reach the Supreme Court, marking a significant moment as it is the first Appeals Court decision addressing firings at multi-member agency boards since Trump took office. 

The case involved the firings of Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, who were removed from their positions, leading to lower court rulings that sought to reinstate them based on historical precedents limiting presidential power. The Supreme Court's 1935 decision in _Humphrey's Executor_ had upheld such limits, ensuring that presidents could only dismiss members for cause. The current ruling raises questions about the future of this precedent, especially as the Supreme Court's conservative majority has already begun to challenge similar restrictions. 

Concerns have been expressed regarding the implications of overturning _Humphrey's Executor_, particularly its potential impact on other independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve. The White House argues that the Constitution grants the president the authority to manage the executive branch fully, including hiring and firing officials at will.
