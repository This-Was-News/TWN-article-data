## Article summary
The FBI is renewing its focus on three significant cases linked to potential public corruption, as announced by Deputy Director Dan Bongino. The cases include the investigation of undetonated pipe bombs left near the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on January 5, 2021, the discovery of a bag of cocaine at the White House during the July 4 weekend in 2023, and the leak of the unpublished Supreme Court Dobbs decision in 2022. Despite an eight-month investigation into the Dobbs leak, the responsible party has not been identified. Bongino emphasized the decision to allocate more resources to these cases, which have generated considerable public interest. 

The pipe bomb investigation has remained open for over four years, with authorities conducting extensive interviews and reviewing thousands of video files, yet the suspect remains unidentified. The cocaine found near the Situation Room led to a brief investigation by the U.S. Secret Service, which concluded due to insufficient evidence. Bongino previously suggested that the cocaine might belong to a member of the Biden family, although the President and his family were not present at the time of the discovery. The FBI is actively seeking tips from the public to assist in these investigations.
