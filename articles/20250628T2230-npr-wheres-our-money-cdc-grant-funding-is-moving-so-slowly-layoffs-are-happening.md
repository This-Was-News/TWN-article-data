## Article summary
The slow disbursement of funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has led to significant challenges for state and local health departments across the U.S. Health officials report that funding is arriving at an "eyedropper" pace, causing confusion and delays in grant awards essential for public health operations. Many departments, which rely heavily on federal funding, are facing imminent funding expirations, leading to service disruptions and layoffs. For instance, HIV prevention programs in states like Ohio and North Carolina have halted services due to funding delays, affecting critical health initiatives. The CDC has been operating with only 30 days of funding at a time, resulting in a backlog of grant distributions. Health officials express frustration over the lack of communication regarding the delays, which they believe may be intentional. Without timely funding, many public health efforts are at risk, potentially exacerbating health crises. The CDC's funding challenges stem from a lengthy apportionment process after the federal budget is approved, leaving health departments in limbo. The situation highlights the critical need for reliable funding to sustain public health initiatives.
