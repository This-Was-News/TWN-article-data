## Article summary
President Trump recently decided against supporting an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, opting instead for diplomatic negotiations with Tehran. This choice followed extensive internal debates within his administration regarding the best approach to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, especially given Iran's weakened military and economic state. Israeli officials had prepared to strike in May, believing the U.S. would back them, but the Trump administration leaned towards diplomacy, particularly after Iran signaled a willingness to negotiate. The discussions revealed divisions among U.S. officials, with some advocating military support for Israel while others expressed concerns about the potential for a wider conflict. 

Despite the U.S. moving military assets to the Middle East in anticipation of a possible attack, Trump informed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that support for military action would be withheld during ongoing negotiations. Israeli plans included a combination of airstrikes and commando raids, but U.S. officials worried that such an operation would take too long to execute effectively. The administration's stance reflects a shift from Trump's earlier aggressive posturing against Iran to a more cautious approach, emphasizing the need for a deal. Ultimately, while military options remain on the table, the current focus is on achieving a diplomatic resolution.
