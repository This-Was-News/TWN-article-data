## Article summary
Extreme heat and humidity, resulting from a heat dome affecting nearly 150 million people in the eastern U.S., are causing roads to buckle in multiple states. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation reported over 50 pavement buckles, while Missouri experienced a car launching due to a buckled road. Roads, primarily made of asphalt, can soften in high temperatures, but most buckling incidents involve concrete roads. Concrete expands when heated, and if it exceeds the designed temperature thresholds, it can push against adjoining panels, leading to buckling. 

Human-caused climate change is intensifying heat waves, making them longer and hotter, which poses challenges for road design, especially in states unaccustomed to extreme heat. While some road failure is expected, it is less concerning than structural damage to buildings. Drivers should remain cautious of cracking roads and report significant issues to local agencies for early intervention. Buckling typically occurs gradually, and maintaining awareness of road conditions is essential for safety.
