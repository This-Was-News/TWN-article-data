## Article summary
Smartphones and computers are now exempt from President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which have raised concerns about the impact on American tech companies reliant on Chinese supply chains, such as Apple. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced this exemption, effective for products entering the U.S. or leaving warehouses from April 5, 2025. This decision is part of a broader tariff strategy, where the tariffs have been paused until early July, except for those on China, which remains subject to a 145% levy. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that the exemption aligns with Trump's goal of reducing reliance on China for critical technology manufacturing. The exemption includes various electronics such as semiconductors and flat panel displays, although it does not alter the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods linked to the fentanyl trade. This development is significant for American tech giants, which were facing potential setbacks due to the tariffs. The U.S. International Trade Commission notes that China has historically been the primary source for electronics in the U.S. market. Overall, this exemption aims to alleviate pressures on the tech sector while continuing to challenge China's trade practices.
