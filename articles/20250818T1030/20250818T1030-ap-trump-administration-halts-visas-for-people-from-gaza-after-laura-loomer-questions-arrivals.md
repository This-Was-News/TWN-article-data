## Article summary
The Trump administration has halted visitor visas for people from Gaza pending a review, following conservative activist Laura Loomer's social media posts questioning how children from Gaza obtained visas for medical treatment in the U.S. The State Department announced the pause on Saturday, citing concerns raised by congressional offices about potential links between organizations involved in securing these visas and terrorist groups like Hamas. Loomer posted videos of children arriving in San Francisco and Houston, facilitated by an organization called HEAL Palestine, and called the situation a national security threat. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the pause on Sunday, stating that the administration is reevaluating the vetting process for these visas. HEAL Palestine, an American humanitarian organization, expressed distress over the decision, emphasizing that it provides urgent medical care to children in Palestine and that the program is not for refugee resettlement. The World Health Organization has called for more medical evacuations from Gaza, where the health system has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict. Over 14,800 patients in Gaza still require lifesaving medical care that is not available locally, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The U.N. and partners report severe shortages of medicines and basic healthcare supplies in Gaza, exacerbated by Israel's blockade.
