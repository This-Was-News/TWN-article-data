## Article summary
Terence Stamp, the British actor known for his roles in early Superman films and Billy Budd, has passed away at the age of 87. His family confirmed his death but did not specify the cause. Stamp was celebrated for his versatility and distinct good looks, often associated with the Swinging '60s. He took creative risks, playing diverse roles such as a transgender woman in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which grossed $16 million in Australia and won an Oscar for best costume design. Born in East London to a working-class family, Stamp overcame early career advice to become a bricklayer. His breakout role in Billy Budd earned him an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe. After a period in India as a swami, he returned to acting with the Superman films, where he played the iconic villain General Zod. His career spanned over 60 films, and he was inspired by actors like Cary Grant, who also came from a working-class background.
