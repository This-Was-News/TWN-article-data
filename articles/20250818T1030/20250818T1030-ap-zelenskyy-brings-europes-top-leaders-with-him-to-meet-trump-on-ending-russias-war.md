## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is leading a group of European leaders to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss ending Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting aims to present a united front against Russia and secure security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskyy hopes to avoid past diplomatic mishaps and strengthen ties with the U.S. amid tensions over Trump's tariffs. The European leaders are concerned about Russia's aggression and want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent. Trump has suggested that Ukraine could end the war quickly by making concessions, including accepting Russia's annexation of Crimea. Zelenskyy insists on a lasting peace and rejects territorial concessions. The meeting follows a summit in Alaska where Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed potential terms for ending the war. European officials confirm that Putin still seeks control of the Donbas region. The U.S. and its allies are considering NATO-like security guarantees for Ukraine. The meeting is expected to be challenging for Zelenskyy, who must navigate pressure from both Trump and Putin. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to attack Ukrainian cities, causing civilian casualties.
