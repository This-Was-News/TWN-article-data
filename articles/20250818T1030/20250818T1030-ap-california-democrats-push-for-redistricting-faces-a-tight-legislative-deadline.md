## Article summary
California Democrats are pushing to redraw congressional districts to gain five more U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterms, responding to President Donald Trump's efforts in Texas. The new map, unveiled by Democrats who hold supermajorities in both chambers, will be voted on by lawmakers and put to voters in a special election in November. If approved, the map would replace the one drawn by an independent commission in 2022 and remain in effect until 2030, contingent on actions by Republican-led states. Republicans vow to challenge the effort legally, arguing that voters in 2010 removed partisan influence from map-drawing. Additionally, lawmakers are addressing climate change, including debates on extending the state's cap-and-trade program and funding for high-speed rail and fire response. Proposals to limit federal immigration crackdowns and enhance racial justice, including reparations for historical wrongs against Black Californians, are also on the agenda. Environmental groups and reparations advocates have criticized some proposals as insufficient.
