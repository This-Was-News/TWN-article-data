## Article summary
Bolivia's presidential election has resulted in an unprecedented runoff between centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz and right-wing former President Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, ending over two decades of left-wing dominance. Paz, a former mayor, led with 32.8% of the votes, while Quiroga secured 26.4%. The left-wing Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party suffered a significant blow, with its candidates receiving minimal support. The election reflects voter dissatisfaction with the country's economic crisis, including high inflation and fuel shortages. Paz's campaign gained traction by teaming up with Edmundo Lara, a social media-savvy ex-police captain. The runoff, scheduled for October 19, marks Bolivia's first since its return to democracy in 1982. Paz's moderate stance contrasts with Quiroga's and Samuel Doria Medina's more radical proposals. Despite Paz's new face, he has deep ties to Bolivia's old political elite. The election signals a potential shift in Bolivia's political and economic alignment, moving away from leftist policies and towards a more centrist or right-wing approach.
