## Article summary
Government documents marked with U.S. State Department markings were found in a public printer at the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage, Alaska, revealing details about the August 15 summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The eight pages, accidentally left behind, included meeting locations, times, and phone numbers of U.S. government employees. The documents disclosed the sequence of meetings, including a ceremonial gift of an American Bald Eagle Desk Statue from Trump to Putin. The White House dismissed the documents as a lunch menu, but they listed names and phone numbers of U.S. staff and state leaders, along with a seating chart for a luncheon honoring Putin. The luncheon, which was canceled, was intended to be a three-course meal. Legal expert Jon Michaels criticized the incident as evidence of incompetence and sloppiness in the administration's preparation for high-stakes meetings. This incident is part of a series of security breaches by officials in the Trump administration, including recent leaks involving law enforcement and national security groups.
