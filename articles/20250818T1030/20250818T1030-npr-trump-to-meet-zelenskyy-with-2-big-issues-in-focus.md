## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with President Trump at the White House, with security guarantees and territorial issues being the main focus. European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, Emmanuel Macron, and Mark Rutte, will join the meeting to present a united front against Trump pressuring Zelenskyy into an unfavorable peace agreement with Russia. Trump has publicly stated that Zelenskyy can end the war immediately or continue fighting, emphasizing that Ukraine should not rejoin NATO. The meeting comes after Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Trump suggested a land swap, which Zelenskyy opposes. European leaders aim to counter Trump's shifting positions on the war, which have changed since his meeting with Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff have indicated progress in negotiations, with the U.S. offering Article 5-like protection to Ukraine, a significant shift in the Trump administration's stance. The White House meeting is expected to address these critical issues and explore potential peace agreements.
