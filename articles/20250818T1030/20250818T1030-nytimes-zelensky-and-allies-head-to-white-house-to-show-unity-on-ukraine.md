## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is set to meet President Trump at the White House to discuss the Ukraine war, aiming to secure a cease-fire and avoid repeating a previous disastrous meeting. European leaders, including Macron and Merkel, will join to present a united front against Russia. Trump's recent alignment with Putin's demands for Ukraine to cede territory has caused concern among European allies. Zelensky seeks a lasting peace, warning that Putin's previous territorial gains were used as a springboard for further attacks. Recent Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities have killed civilians, underscoring the ongoing conflict. Trump has offered U.S. security assurances for Ukraine post-war, a significant shift. The meeting follows a U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska where Trump supported Putin's plan for Ukraine to cede land. European leaders are racing to keep up with Trump's shifting stances, fearing further territorial concessions to Russia. The fate of Ukraine is strategically important for Europe, and the outcome of the talks could shape the future of the region.
