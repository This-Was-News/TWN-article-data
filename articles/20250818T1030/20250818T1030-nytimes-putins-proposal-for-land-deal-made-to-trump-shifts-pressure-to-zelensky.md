## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed that Ukraine hand over the remaining part of the Donbas region to Moscow to halt fighting, shifting pressure to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The proposal, backed by U.S. President Trump, involves Ukraine ceding territory in exchange for a ceasefire. Zelensky faces a challenging meeting with Trump, who may view him as an obstacle to peace if he rejects the deal. The proposal is seen as a strategic move by Putin to weaken Ukraine internally or influence Trump's stance. Ukraine's constitution prohibits territorial concessions without a national referendum, and a recent poll shows 78% of Ukrainians oppose transferring territory to Russia. The Donbas region, including Donetsk and Luhansk, holds strategic value for Ukraine, with heavily fortified cities like Kramatorsk and Slovansk. Ceding these areas would weaken Ukraine's defensive positions and allow Russia to reattack from a stronger position. Russian negotiators had previously demanded full control of four Ukrainian regions, but Putin's current proposal involves only two. The outcome of the discussions between Trump, Zelensky, and European officials remains uncertain, with Russia's military actions continuing despite diplomatic talks.
