## Article summary
Washington, D.C. is in its second week of heightened law enforcement presence, with federal agents and National Guard troops conducting patrols. President Trump has defended this crackdown, despite critics arguing it's based on false claims about crime rates. While Trump portrays it as a necessary measure to combat crime, others see it as an overreach of power. The city has seen a decline in crime and homelessness, but the administration's actions have raised concerns about the long-term implications. Legal experts and local leaders have challenged the federal government's authority, leading to tensions and lawsuits. Meanwhile, additional National Guard troops are being deployed, and the situation remains volatile. Community leaders are working to maintain calm and avoid escalation, while residents grapple with the uncertainty and anxiety caused by the ongoing crisis.
