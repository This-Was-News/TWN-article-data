## Article summary
Hurricane Erin, a powerful Category 4 storm with 130 mph winds, is moving northwest and expected to create dangerous surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5 status, is forecast to strengthen further before gradually weakening but remains a major hurricane. It is currently near the Southeast Bahamas, with hurricane-force winds extending 60 miles and tropical-storm-force winds reaching 230 miles. The Bahamas has issued a Tropical Storm Watch, while Dare County, North Carolina, has declared an emergency and ordered evacuations for Hatteras Island. Erin's outer bands have already affected Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, causing power outages and flight cancellations. Rough ocean conditions and life-threatening surf are expected to impact the Bahamas, Bermuda, the U.S. East Coast, and Canada's Atlantic coast as the storm turns north and then northeast. Scientists link the rapid intensification of hurricanes to climate change, with warmer ocean temperatures fueling more intense storms.
