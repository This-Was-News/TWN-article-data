## Article summary
European leaders have expressed renewed support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following a contentious meeting with U.S. President Trump, where Trump accused Zelenskyy of "gambling with World War III." In London, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed Zelenskyy, affirming the UK's full backing. Many European leaders criticized the Trump administration's perceived alignment with Russia and defended Ukraine's position. French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the distinction between Russia as the aggressor and Ukraine as the victim, while other leaders echoed similar sentiments of solidarity. 

Germany's officials reiterated their unwavering support for Ukraine, and leaders from across Europe, including those from Spain, Lithuania, and Norway, quickly voiced their backing for Zelenskyy. The response from Ukraine was swift, with politicians expressing concern over the U.S. administration's attitude. The Kremlin, however, remained silent initially, with Russian officials attacking Zelenskyy and praising Trump. This situation has prompted discussions among European leaders about their next steps in support of Ukraine, highlighting a unified front against Russian aggression.
