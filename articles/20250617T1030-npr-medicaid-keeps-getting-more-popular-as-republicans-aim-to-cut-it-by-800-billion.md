## Article summary
Medicaid's popularity has surged, with a recent poll indicating that 83% of the public view the program favorably, up from 77% just months prior. This increase in support is notably strong among Republicans, with three in four now expressing favorable views. The rise in popularity coincides with Republican efforts to cut nearly $800 billion from Medicaid as part of their budget proposal, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which has garnered unfavorable opinions from two-thirds of Americans. Many individuals have personal connections to Medicaid, leading to a desire for increased funding rather than cuts; only 17% support decreased federal funding. The proposed cuts are expected to negatively impact local hospitals and increase the uninsured population, which further fuels public discontent. Republican lawmakers are attempting to frame the cuts as necessary for targeting ineligible individuals, while Democrats emphasize the detrimental effects on vulnerable populations. Concerns are prevalent among current Medicaid beneficiaries, who fear losing coverage and the associated negative impacts on their health and finances. Overall, the contrasting views on Medicaid and the budget bill highlight the complexity of public opinion on healthcare funding in the U.S.
