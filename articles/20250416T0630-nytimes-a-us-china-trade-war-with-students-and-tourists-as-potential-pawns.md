## Article summary
The U.S.-China trade war is increasingly affecting cultural and educational exchanges, with China warning its citizens against visiting the U.S. and being cautious about studying there. The relationship has deteriorated, with the U.S. revoking visas for some Chinese students and conservatives suggesting retaliatory measures against them. Historically, the flow of people between the two countries helped stabilize relations, but tensions have turned these ties into bargaining chips. Recent meetings between President Xi and President Biden aimed to restore exchanges, yet economic and political factors continue to complicate matters. China has imposed tariffs and limitations on American companies and films in response to U.S. actions, while also issuing travel and study warnings to its citizens. Concerns have arisen among Chinese students and their families regarding potential hostility in the U.S., leading to discussions about canceling trips and applying to universities in other countries. Experts suggest that these warnings from China serve as a signal to the U.S. about escalating tensions. The climate has made many aspiring students reconsider their plans, with some seeking alternatives in Australia or Europe. Overall, the situation reflects a fragile and escalating relationship between the two nations.
