## Article summary
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved Skydance's merger with Paramount, a highly scrutinized media deal. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr endorsed the deal after Skydance pledged to uphold unbiased journalism and avoid diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The merger marks a shift in control from the Redstone family to David Ellison, son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison. Paramount has faced recent turmoil, including a $16 million settlement with President Trump and accusations of political motives in canceling CBS's Late Night show. Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna M. Gomez criticized the approval, arguing it pressures Paramount and violates press freedom.
