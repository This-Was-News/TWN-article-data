## Article summary
Mahmoud Khalil is seeking asylum, arguing that his deportation to Syria or Algeria could result in his death due to threats from Israel. During a court hearing, Khalil's lawyers emphasized that his pro-Palestinian activism and the Trump administration's labeling of him as an anti-Semite have made him a target. Khalil expressed fear of assassination, kidnapping, or torture if deported, citing his history as a critic of Israel and opposition to Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. Judge Jamee Comans ruled that she could not question the Secretary of State's determination regarding Khalil's activism but would consider his asylum claim. Experts testified that Khalil's elevated profile poses a direct threat to Israel's interests, increasing his risk if returned to the Middle East. A federal judge has temporarily blocked his deportation while reviewing potential violations of his free speech rights. Khalil's lawyers are prepared to pursue the case to the Supreme Court if necessary. Khalil expressed skepticism about the immigration system but remains hopeful for a fair consideration of his situation. The decision on his asylum claim is pending.
