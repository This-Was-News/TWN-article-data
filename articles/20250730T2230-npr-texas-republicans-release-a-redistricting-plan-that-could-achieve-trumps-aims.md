## Article summary
Texas Republicans have proposed a new redistricting map aimed at securing up to five additional congressional seats for the GOP, aligning with President Trump's goals. The plan targets several Democratic-held districts, potentially forcing some Democratic incumbents to compete against each other. Analysts suggest the new map could result in 30 Republican-won districts compared to eight for Democrats, increasing the GOP's current 25-seat hold in Texas. Democrats have criticized the plan, with some considering fleeing the state to deny Republicans a legislative quorum, while others are raising funds to support competitive Democratic candidates. Legal challenges are expected, as the current Texas congressional map is already under litigation for alleged racial discrimination, and similar fights are ongoing in other states.
