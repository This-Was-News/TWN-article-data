## Article summary
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned that flight disruptions could increase across U.S. airports as the summer travel season approaches, following significant issues at Newark Liberty International Airport. Technological disruptions and staffing shortages have plagued Newark, highlighted by recent radar outages that caused delays and cancellations. Duffy plans to meet with major airline leaders to discuss potentially scaling back flights at Newark, although the extent of reductions remains uncertain. He emphasized that the outdated air traffic control systems are under stress and need urgent modernization, which he has proposed through a multibillion-dollar plan. Recent outages have caused major delays not only at Newark but also at other airports, such as Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has attributed many of these problems to equipment failures and staffing shortages. Despite concerns, Duffy assured that U.S. airspace remains safe for travelers. He also mentioned the need to address staffing issues, noting that some flights had delays averaging over two hours. His modernization proposal includes digitizing flight data management and extending the retirement age for air traffic controllers. Overall, Duffy's comments reflect a pressing need for improvement in the nation's air travel infrastructure.
