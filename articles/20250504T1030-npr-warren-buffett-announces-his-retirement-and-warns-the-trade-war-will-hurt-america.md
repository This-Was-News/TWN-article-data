## Article summary
Warren Buffett announced his retirement during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, revealing he will step down as CEO at the end of the year, passing the leadership to Greg Abel. At the event, he expressed concerns about the ongoing trade war, stating that "trade should not be a weapon" and emphasizing the importance of global trade for America's prosperity and security. Buffett's remarks came amidst growing unease over the impact of tariffs initiated by the Trump administration, which have disrupted financial markets and raised fears of a recession. He received a warm reception from the audience, who applauded his stance against the tariffs, highlighting the uncertainty they bring to businesses. 

Buffett's comments also reflect a broader sentiment among U.S. companies, many of which are revising their financial forecasts due to the trade conflict. Known for his folksy demeanor and patriotic views, Buffett framed his opposition to tariffs as a matter of national interest, arguing that global prosperity ultimately benefits the U.S. economy. The meeting, dubbed the "Woodstock for Capitalists," attracted nearly 20,000 attendees, showcasing Buffett's unique ability to turn a corporate event into a celebratory weekend. Buffett's legacy, built over 60 years of leading Berkshire Hathaway, positions him as a significant figure in both business and American culture.
