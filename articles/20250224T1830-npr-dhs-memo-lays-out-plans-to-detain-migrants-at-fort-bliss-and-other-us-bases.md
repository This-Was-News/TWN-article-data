## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is planning to establish immigration detention facilities on U.S. military bases, as outlined in an internal memo. This initiative, part of the Trump administration's efforts, aims to significantly increase the military's involvement in immigration enforcement. Fort Bliss, located near El Paso, Texas, is designated to initially house up to 1,000 immigrants for a 60-day evaluation, with potential expansion to 10,000 detainees, serving as a central hub for deportations. The plan may extend to other military locations across the country, including bases in New Jersey, New York, Utah, and Florida.

The memo indicates that the DHS is seeking assistance from the Department of Defense to detain immigrants lacking legal status. This move comes amidst challenges in current detention capacities, as existing facilities are reportedly at full capacity. The administration has faced pressure to expedite deportations, with officials promising unprecedented rates of removal for immigrants with criminal convictions. There is historical precedent for using military bases for housing immigrants, including temporary shelters for unaccompanied minors and Afghan evacuees. Overall, this strategy reflects a broader push for mass deportations under the current administration.
