## Article summary
New photos and letters reveal insights into Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan townhouse, where he hosted elite guests and displayed controversial items. The seven-story townhouse featured eccentric decor, including framed prosthetic eyeballs and a sculpture of a bird clinging to a rope. Epstein entertained a rotating cast of celebrities, academics, politicians, and businessmen, with events ranging from mundane meals to performances and intellectual discussions. The townhouse also housed a massage room where Epstein allegedly assaulted underage girls, with no visible surveillance cameras. Despite his criminal past, Epstein maintained connections with powerful figures, including former Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak, media mogul Mortimer Zuckerman, and director Woody Allen, who described the dinners as reminiscent of Dracula's castle.
