## Article summary
The web page discusses Georgia's implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients, which has been active for two years. The system, known as Pathways to Coverage, requires recipients to report their work, study, or volunteer hours monthly to maintain eligibility. Tanisha Corporal, a social worker, faced significant challenges and delays in proving her eligibility despite meeting the requirements, highlighting the bureaucratic hurdles and red tape involved. Georgia has spent over $91 million on the program, with concerns raised about the high costs and the potential for improper denials of coverage. Health advocates worry that other states may face similar issues as they implement work requirements under a new federal law, with critics arguing that such requirements do not effectively boost employment and primarily serve to cut off health insurance for many recipients.
