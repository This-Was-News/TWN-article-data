## Article summary
The CDC has issued new guidance on Covid vaccines for children, contradicting Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent announcement to remove these vaccines from the federal immunization schedule. The CDC maintains that Covid shots are still recommended for healthy children aged 6 months to 17 years but emphasizes shared decision-making between caregivers and healthcare providers. This decision follows a backlash from pediatricians and public health experts, who argue that young children and pregnant women are at high risk for severe illness from Covid. Kennedy's policy change has raised concerns about potential insurance coverage issues for the vaccines. 

While the CDC has removed prior recommendations for pregnant women, experts stress the importance of vaccination for this group due to increased risks associated with Covid. The CDC continues to advise pregnant and postpartum women to get vaccinated. The new policy may create barriers for children seeking vaccinations, particularly in retail pharmacies, as consultations with healthcare providers are now required. Additionally, there are worries that insurers might withhold coverage based on the new recommendations. Overall, the changes reflect a shift in vaccine policy under Kennedy's leadership and have sparked significant debate among health professionals.
