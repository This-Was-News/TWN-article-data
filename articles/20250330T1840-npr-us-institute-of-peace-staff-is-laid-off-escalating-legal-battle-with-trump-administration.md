## Article summary
The U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) has laid off nearly all of its staff amid a legal dispute with the Trump administration over its authority to dismantle the organization. Following a federal judge's refusal to block the takeover by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), more than 200 employees received termination notices. The layoffs, which began late on a Friday evening, also extend to overseas employees, who have been instructed to prepare for relocation. Former board members are suing the Trump administration, claiming a forceful takeover and accusing it of trespassing. 

The situation escalated after Trump ordered USIP to shut down as part of a broader federal downsizing effort. Employees had taken precautions to protect their data and cybersecurity in anticipation of potential intrusions by DOGE representatives. The legal battle raises questions about the executive branch's control over USIP, which was established by Congress and operates as a private nonprofit. The think tank has significant assets, including an $80 million endowment and a Washington office building funded by private donations. The outcome of the ongoing court hearings will be crucial in determining the future of USIP and its operations.
