## Article summary
Shabbos Kestenbaum, a 26-year-old Orthodox Jew from the Bronx, has emerged as a prominent voice against antisemitism in universities, particularly Harvard, where he previously studied. After suing Harvard alongside five other students, alleging a hostile environment for Jewish students, he chose to continue litigation independently despite a settlement. Kestenbaum's activism aligns with conservative efforts to challenge what he perceives as leftist ideologies on college campuses, advocating for stronger disciplinary measures against protests and reforming curricula. His rise to prominence includes speaking engagements at significant political events, including the Republican National Convention and the White House. 

Kestenbaum's narrative reflects a broader concern among Jews about their safety and acceptance on American campuses, and he has garnered support from various conservative groups. Critics, however, argue that his portrayal of the situation at Harvard may be exaggerated. He plans to move to Los Angeles for a position at PragerU, where he aims to promote conservative values and accountability in education. Kestenbaum's journey showcases his transformation from a Democrat to a conservative activist, highlighting the complexities of identity and political alignment in contemporary discourse.
