## Article summary
The Trump administration has been accused of easing enforcement against corporations, particularly following a report by Public Citizen, which revealed that at least 89 investigations or cases against companies have been paused or dismissed in just over a month. This shift in policy includes cases involving foreign bribery, safety violations, and environmental crimes, aligning with Trump's focus on national security over regulatory enforcement. Notably, the administration has halted enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and moved away from regulating cryptocurrency businesses, with the SEC dropping cases against exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase. Critics, such as Rick Claypool from Public Citizen, argue that this leniency equates to giving "get out of jail free" cards to corporate lawbreakers, endangering public interests. Officials from the Justice Department and other agencies maintain their commitment to law enforcement, despite concerns about preferential treatment for companies with ties to Trump. The changes have raised alarms regarding the potential consequences of diminished corporate accountability and the implications for public safety and consumer protection.
