## Article summary
Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder in the death of her boyfriend, police officer John O'Keefe, after a Massachusetts jury found her not guilty following her second trial. Read, 45, was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow after a night of drinking in January 2022. Her defense claimed that O'Keefe was killed by fellow officers during a fight and that evidence was tampered with to frame her. The jury found her guilty only of operating a vehicle under the influence, resulting in a one-year probation sentence. 

The trial featured extensive testimony and competing narratives from both sides, with the defense arguing that the police investigation was flawed and biased. Read's first trial ended in a mistrial in 2024 due to a hung jury. Key differences in the second trial included the absence of the lead investigator, Michael Proctor, who was dismissed for misconduct. Throughout the proceedings, Read maintained her innocence and expressed gratitude for her supporters. The case garnered significant media attention, contributing to public interest and debate surrounding the investigation and the legal proceedings.
