## Article summary
The SAVE Act, backed by Congressional Republicans, proposes significant changes to voter registration, requiring individuals to present documents proving U.S. citizenship. Critics argue that this could disenfranchise millions, as an estimated 21.3 million voting-age Americans lack easy access to such documents. The bill, initially introduced amid unsubstantiated claims of noncitizen voting, is seen as an effort to enhance election integrity, though evidence of widespread illegal voting is lacking. It would particularly burden married women who have changed their names, requiring additional documentation for them to register.

The legislation mandates that voters show proof of citizenship in person, complicating the registration process, especially for those in rural areas or with limited transportation options. Election officials express concern over the bill's implementation and the potential for criminal penalties for errors, which could deter individuals from working in election administration. As states consider similar proof-of-citizenship laws, the SAVE Act's approach has drawn comparisons to existing laws in Kansas and Arizona, which have faced legal challenges for suppressing eligible voters. Overall, the bill raises significant questions about access to voting and the implications for American democracy.
