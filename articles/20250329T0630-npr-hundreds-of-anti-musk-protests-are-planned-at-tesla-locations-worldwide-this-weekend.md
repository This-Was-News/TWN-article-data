## Article summary
The "Tesla Takedown" campaign is organizing hundreds of protests worldwide against Tesla CEO Elon Musk, particularly targeting his role in the Trump administration. Scheduled for this weekend, the protests aim to be the largest yet, with an anticipated 500 demonstrations globally. The movement is driven by anger over Musk's actions, particularly his influence on government dismantling through the DOGE initiative, which protesters claim is harming the country’s infrastructure. Organizers encourage boycotting Tesla by selling cars and stocks, indicating a grassroots effort against Musk's wealth, which is closely tied to Tesla's success. 

Critics of Musk cite various grievances, including his controversial political gestures and support for far-right parties. While the protests are intended to be peaceful, some backlash against Tesla has turned violent, with incidents of vandalism reported. Musk has publicly targeted activists involved in the protests, leading to threats against them. The Tesla Takedown movement seeks to diminish Musk's power by tarnishing Tesla's brand, arguing that if Musk loses his status, he will lose political favor with figures like Trump. Overall, the protests reflect a significant public response to Musk's political and business decisions.
