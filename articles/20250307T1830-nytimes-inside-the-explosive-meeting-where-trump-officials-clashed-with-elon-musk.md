## Article summary
The article discusses a contentious Cabinet Room meeting between Trump administration officials and Elon Musk, highlighting tensions regarding Musk's influence and approach to government efficiency. Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, confronted Musk over his criticisms regarding staff reductions, particularly in the context of the State Department and USAID. Musk accused Rubio of inaction, leading to a heated exchange where Rubio defended his record, citing significant staff reductions. President Trump intervened to support Rubio and emphasized the need for collaboration, suggesting a more refined approach to Musk's initiatives. The meeting marked a potential turning point, indicating Trump's willingness to impose limits on Musk's aggressive strategies, which have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. Despite Musk's significant financial backing of Trump, concerns about his methods have led to growing complaints within the administration. The discussions revealed underlying frustrations among cabinet members about Musk's tactics, which some perceive as chaotic. Ultimately, Trump signaled that future efforts to streamline the federal workforce would adopt a more measured approach, with secretaries taking the lead while Musk's team would serve in an advisory capacity. The long-term implications of this meeting remain uncertain, as the dynamics within the administration continue to evolve.
