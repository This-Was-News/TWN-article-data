## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of U.S. tariffs on Malaysia's solar industry, which once thrived with Chinese investment. Companies from China, facing U.S. tariffs, often invest in countries like Malaysia to bypass these restrictions, creating jobs and boosting local economies. However, the U.S. has introduced new global tariffs of 40% on goods transshipped through third countries, aiming to stop this practice. This policy poses significant challenges for Southeast Asian economies that rely on Chinese components and raw materials. Malaysia's experience serves as a case study, showing how U.S. tariffs on solar equipment led to a drastic decline in its solar panel industry, prompting the country to rethink its economic strategies.
