## Article summary
A grassroots movement called The People's Union USA is organizing a national boycott, termed an "economic blackout," on Friday, urging Americans to refrain from shopping for 24 hours. This initiative responds to recent rollbacks of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at major companies, including Target. The boycott's founder, John Schwarz, emphasizes that the movement is politically independent and focuses on systemic change rather than individual figures. Participants are encouraged to avoid all types of purchases, except for essential items, and to support local businesses instead.

The blackout will begin at midnight and aims to demonstrate consumer power, with plans for additional boycotts in the future, including a week-long blackout against Amazon in March. The movement has gained traction on social media and has celebrity support, including endorsements from actors like John Leguizamo and Bette Midler. The initiative aligns with other activist efforts, including a boycott against Target starting March 5. While the actual impact of the boycott on retail sales is uncertain, the organizers hope to raise awareness about corporate accountability and the struggles of the working class.
