## Article summary
In an interview with NPR, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez discusses the challenges facing the Democratic Party and critiques the current political landscape under President Trump. She expresses concerns that the Republican Party is making significant mistakes, particularly with proposed cuts to Medicaid that could harm voters' healthcare. Ocasio-Cortez maintains her support for a path to citizenship for undocumented individuals, despite calls from some Democrats for a new approach to immigration. She confronts threats from Trump administration officials regarding her advocacy for immigrant rights, emphasizing her commitment to informing constituents about their legal protections.

Ocasio-Cortez also shares her frustrations with government inefficiencies, stating, "Everything feels increasingly like a scam," highlighting rising costs and fees that burden ordinary citizens. Unlike Trump, she does not advocate for drastic government cuts, particularly in essential agencies like the FAA and NIH, but is open to scrutinizing certain programs such as Medicare Advantage, which she labels a scam. As a seasoned lawmaker at 35, she reflects on her evolution since entering Congress, aiming to guide her party back to power while addressing the needs of everyday Americans.
