## Article summary
New data analysis by NPR, PBS's FRONTLINE, and First Street reveals that FEMA's flood maps significantly underestimated the flood risks at Camp Mystic, where over two dozen people died in a recent Texas flood. The analysis shows that at least 17 structures, including four cabins for young campers, were in areas designated by FEMA as extreme flood hazards, where water moves at its highest velocity and depth. Nationwide, First Street found that more than twice as many Americans live in dangerous flood-prone areas than FEMA's maps suggest, leaving many homeowners and local officials unaware of the risk. FEMA's maps, which have not accounted for rainfall and flash flooding for decades, serve as critical warnings and are one of the few ways the federal government can require people to take precautionary measures. However, many properties affected by disasters are turning up outside FEMA's floodplains, and the agency lacks the mandate and funding from Congress to address this issue, with special interests and political factors further complicating the situation.
