## Article summary
The cancellation of "The Late Show" with Stephen Colbert is seen as a setback for late-night television rather than for Colbert himself, who may benefit from the increased attention and opportunity to transition to his next act. Colbert, known for his sharp wit and political commentary, had become a ratings leader but may have been constrained by the format of late-night television. The cancellation comes at a time when late-night TV is struggling due to increased competition from the internet and growing politicization, which has fragmented audiences. The decision to cancel the show is likely driven by both financial struggles and political considerations, reflecting a shift in how networks prioritize late-night programming. While Colbert's audience may disperse to other platforms like YouTube or podcasts, his unique talents could find a new home outside of traditional network television.
