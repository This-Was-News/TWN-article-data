## Article summary
A tour helicopter crashed into the Hudson River on April 10, 2025, resulting in the deaths of six individuals, including three children from a family visiting from Spain, and the pilot. The helicopter, operated by New York Helicopter, went down near Houston Street shortly after takeoff from the Downtown Skyport. Witnesses reported a loud explosion as the helicopter experienced catastrophic failure, with parts separating midair before it plunged into the water. First responders quickly arrived at the scene, with some victims being treated in New Jersey hospitals, where two later succumbed to their injuries.

The incident has reignited calls from lawmakers for a ban on non-essential helicopter flights over Manhattan, citing safety concerns. Advocacy group Stop the Chop highlighted the dangers of congested airspace, noting that over 30,000 sightseeing flights occur annually. Critics have also raised concerns about the age of the helicopter fleet operating in the area. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal described the crash as a foreseeable tragedy, emphasizing the need for stricter regulations on tourist helicopter flights to prevent future incidents.
