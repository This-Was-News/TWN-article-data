## Article summary
The Trump administration has removed a longstanding clause from federal contracting rules that explicitly prohibited segregated facilities, a change that has significant implications for federal contractors. This clause had been in place since the 1960s, mandating that contractors maintain integrated workspaces and services, including waiting rooms and drinking fountains. The modification follows President Trump's executive orders aimed at altering diversity and inclusion policies, which included repealing earlier directives from the Johnson administration. Legal experts highlight that while state and federal laws against segregation remain, this change is symbolic and reflects a shift in federal contracting standards. 

The General Services Administration (GSA) implemented these changes without the usual public notice and comment period, raising concerns about the transparency of the process. Critics argue that this approach undermines democratic oversight in federal contracting. The deleted clause was part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and defined segregated facilities broadly, covering various aspects of workplace integration. Although the prohibition has been lifted, compliance with existing civil rights laws remains mandatory for all businesses. The removal of this clause has shocked some federal workers, who express fears about the implications for civil rights and workplace equality.
