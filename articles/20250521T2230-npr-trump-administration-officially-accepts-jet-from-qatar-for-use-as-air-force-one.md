## Article summary
The Trump administration has officially accepted a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari government to be modified for use as Air Force One. The Air Force is in the process of preparing a contract for the necessary upgrades, although details remain classified. Trump noted that he would be "stupid" to decline the gift, which he plans to keep in his presidential library after leaving office. However, experts caution that converting the jet to meet Air Force One standards could take years, despite its luxurious features. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, argue that accepting the gift violates the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. Currently, two new Boeing 747-8 planes are being customized to replace the aging Air Force One fleet, which has been in service for over three decades. The project to upgrade the new planes has faced delays, and they are not expected to be ready for several more years. Experts estimate that outfitting the Qatari jet to meet security and communication standards could cost hundreds of millions to possibly a billion dollars. The current Air Force One models are equipped with advanced communication and defense systems, which the Qatari jet lacks. Overall, while the gift may appear beneficial, the logistical and financial implications raise significant concerns.
