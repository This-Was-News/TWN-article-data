## Article summary
Texas Democrats have fled the state to prevent Republicans from redrawing congressional district maps that would favor their party. Senator John Cornyn requested the FBI to locate and arrest these Democrats, who are in New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts. The Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, threatened to seek a court order declaring their seats vacant if they do not return by Friday. Governor Greg Abbott accused the Democrats of potential bribery and directed the Texas Rangers to investigate. The F.B.I. has not yet commented on whether it will get involved, and the Texas House lacks the quorum needed to vote on the redistricting maps.
