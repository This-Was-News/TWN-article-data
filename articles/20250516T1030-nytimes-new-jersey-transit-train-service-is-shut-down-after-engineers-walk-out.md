## Article summary
A statewide transit strike in New Jersey commenced just after midnight Friday, marking the first in over 40 years, as approximately 450 unionized locomotive engineers walked off the job due to a pay dispute. The strike has halted NJ Transit's rail services, leaving many commuters in need of alternative transportation to New York City. Union president Mark Wallace criticized NJ Transit for prioritizing other expenses over fair wages for workers. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri expressed willingness to negotiate, while Governor Philip D. Murphy stated that the agency's offer was close to the union's demands.

During the strike, NJ Transit is encouraging non-essential workers to work from home and has arranged for existing bus services to continue, although additional chartered buses won't start until Monday and can only accommodate about 20% of displaced riders. Commuters can use their rail tickets on existing bus routes, but not on other carriers. The strike follows months of unsuccessful negotiations and federal mediation efforts, with the engineers seeking pay parity with their peers at Amtrak and other regional railroads. The union's rejection of a previous tentative agreement has further complicated negotiations, leading to rising tensions between the parties involved.
