## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a high-stakes summit that could influence the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war and European security. The meeting offers Trump an opportunity to demonstrate his negotiation skills and Putin a chance to solidify Russia's gains and pull Ukraine back into its orbit. However, the exclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the summit raises concerns about the West's policy on Ukraine. Both sides remain far apart on their demands for peace, with Putin resisting any temporary ceasefire linked to Western arms supplies and Ukraine's mobilization efforts. Trump has indicated a 25% chance of the summit failing but suggested a potential three-way meeting with Zelenskyy if successful. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasized Russia's clear position, while Trump aims for a broad peace deal quickly. The summit, held at a military base near Anchorage, includes a one-on-one discussion, delegation meetings, and a joint press conference. Skepticism surrounds the potential agreement, with critics arguing it benefits Putin more than the U.S. Foreign governments and U.S. adversaries will closely watch the interaction, assessing Trump's credibility. The war has caused heavy losses on both sides, with Ukraine struggling to hold off Russia's larger army. The choice of Alaska as the venue underscores the distancing from Europe and Ukraine, with historical and strategic significance.
