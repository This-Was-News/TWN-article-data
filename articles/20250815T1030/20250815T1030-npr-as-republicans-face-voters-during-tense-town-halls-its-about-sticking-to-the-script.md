## Article summary
During the August recess, Republican lawmakers are navigating how to discuss the One Big Beautiful Bill, President Trump's signature legislation. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) provided a memo with crafted messaging to help Republicans promote their legislative victories and contrast with Democrats. However, many Republicans are avoiding town halls, with only about 37 out of 219 House Republicans hosting any kind of town hall during the recess. Those who do hold town halls face vocal constituents, often focusing on healthcare, immigration, and tax cuts. Rep. Mike Flood, for instance, faced a Democratic-heavy audience in Nebraska, where attendees questioned his support for the bill and its impact on healthcare. Republicans like Flood and Rep. Dan Newhouse stick to NRCC talking points, emphasizing provisions like tax cuts and work requirements for Medicaid. Despite efforts, political science professor Jim Curry notes that Republicans' messaging on the bill is not strong or clear, and a recent poll shows 52% of registered voters disapprove of Republicans' performance in Congress. The challenge for Republicans is to effectively communicate their agenda while addressing voters' concerns.
