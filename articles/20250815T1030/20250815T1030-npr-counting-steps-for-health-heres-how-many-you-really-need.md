## Article summary
Researchers have found that around 7,000 daily steps are optimal for health benefits. This target is supported by studies showing significant reductions in risks of mortality, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and dementia. The widely cited 10,000-step goal lacks strong scientific backing and originated from a marketing campaign. Studies indicate that exceeding 7,000 steps offers diminishing returns, though it remains beneficial. Even modest increases, like from 2,000 to 4,000 steps, can substantially improve health. The ideal step count may vary with age, with older adults needing fewer steps than younger ones. Speed of walking does not significantly impact health benefits, as the total number of steps matters more. Current U.S. guidelines focus on exercise duration rather than step counts, but experts advocate for including steps in future recommendations. Movement should be balanced with mobility and strength training for overall health. Those who spend extended periods sitting may need more steps to counteract the negative effects of inactivity.
