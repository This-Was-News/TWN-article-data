## Article summary
The Trump administration appointed the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Terry Cole, as Washington D.C.'s emergency police commissioner, granting him the powers of the city's police chief. This move increases federal control over D.C.'s police department, requiring all orders to be approved by Cole. D.C. officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb, have pushed back, calling the directive unlawful. The federal takeover follows a directive by D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith to share information with immigration agencies, which was rescinded by Attorney General Pam Bond. The administration's actions are part of a broader effort to enforce stricter immigration policies and combat crime, despite D.C.'s homicide rate being lower than other major U.S. cities. The National Guard has been deployed to assist in maintaining law and order, with increased federal presence in the city. Homeless residents are being encouraged to leave encampments, with some doing so voluntarily and others facing potential forced removals. The administration's actions have drawn criticism and protests from residents and advocates.
