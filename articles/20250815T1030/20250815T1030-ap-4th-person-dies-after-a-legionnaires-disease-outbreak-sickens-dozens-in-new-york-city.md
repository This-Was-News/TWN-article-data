## Article summary
A fourth person has died due to a Legionnaires' disease outbreak in New York City, with dozens sickened since late July. The outbreak in Central Harlem has led to 17 hospitalizations as of Thursday. The bacteria causing the disease was found in 12 cooling towers across 10 buildings, including a city-run hospital and a sexual health clinic. Remediation efforts have been completed on 11 of the cooling towers, with the final one due by Friday. Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, which thrive in warm water and spread through building water systems. Symptoms include cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath, appearing within two days to two weeks of exposure. Dr. Michelle Morse, the city's acting health commissioner, reported a decline in new cases, indicating containment of the bacteria's sources. Residents and workers in the area are advised to seek medical attention if they develop flu-like symptoms.
