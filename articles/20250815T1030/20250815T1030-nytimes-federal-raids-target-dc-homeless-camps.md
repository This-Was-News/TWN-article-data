## Article summary
Federal authorities attempted to clear homeless encampments in northwestern Washington on Thursday night as part of President Trump's takeover of the city's law enforcement. The operation, involving the F.B.I. and U.S. Secret Service, aimed to remove tents from areas like Washington Circle, but faced obstacles when residents presented city notices extending their stay. District officials and advocates had spent the day urging unhoused individuals to seek shelter or risk arrest. The scope and effectiveness of the raids remained unclear, with federal agents appearing in small groups at various sites. The city had prepared extra shelter beds and offered services, but advocates argued these were insufficient. The White House stated that homeless individuals would be offered shelter, addiction or mental health services, or face fines or jail time. The city's attorney general provided legal guidance for those in encampments. The operation differed from typical district procedures, involving federal agencies and occurring at night. The city's deputy mayor emphasized support roles in connecting homeless individuals with services and cleaning up after the clearings.
