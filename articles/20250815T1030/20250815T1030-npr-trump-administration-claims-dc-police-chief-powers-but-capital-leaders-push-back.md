## Article summary
The Trump administration has appointed the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Terry Cole, as Washington D.C.'s 'emergency police commissioner' with full powers of the police chief, increasing federal control over the city. D.C. officials, including Attorney General Brian Schwalb and Mayor Muriel Bowser, have pushed back, calling the move unlawful and asserting that local police must follow the orders of the city's current police chief, Pamela Smith. The federal takeover includes rescinding Smith's directive to share information with immigration agencies and requires all new directives to be approved by Cole. This move is part of President Trump's broader agenda to test the limits of his legal authorities, relying on a state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and plans for mass deportations. The increased federal presence in D.C. includes National Guard troops, Homeland Security police, and DEA agents patrolling various areas. The administration has stated that the Guard members are not making arrests but are providing a visible law enforcement presence to deter crime. Meanwhile, homeless residents have been voluntarily leaving encampments, with advocates expecting further enforcement actions in the coming days.
