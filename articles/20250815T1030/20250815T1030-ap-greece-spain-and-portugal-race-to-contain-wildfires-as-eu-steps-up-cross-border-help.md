## Article summary
Firefighters in Greece, Spain, and Portugal are actively battling wildfires, taking advantage of calmer winds to slow the blazes. Despite the improved conditions, much of southern Europe remains at high risk due to hot, dry weather. In Spain, a volunteer firefighter died from severe burns, marking the third death in the country from recent wildfires, with thousands of people evacuated from their homes. Greece has contained a major blaze outside Patras, with three arrests made in connection to a suspected arson. Authorities in Greece are preparing for potential new wildfires due to shifting winds and extreme temperatures. The European Union's civil protection agency has responded to requests for assistance from several countries, including Greece, Spain, Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Albania, sending firefighting planes and helicopters. The number of activations for wildfires in 2025 has already matched the total for the entire 2024 fire season. In Albania, wildfires destroyed over 200 homes, with authorities promising to apprehend suspected arsonists. Morocco also battled its largest wildfire of the year, which was successfully contained with the help of water-dropping aircraft and over 450 personnel.
