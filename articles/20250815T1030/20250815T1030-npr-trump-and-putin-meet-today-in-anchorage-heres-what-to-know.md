## Article summary
President Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, today. The summit is significant as Putin is isolated by the West due to the invasion of Ukraine. Trump, who promised a quick end to the Ukraine war during his 2024 campaign, expressed confidence in a potential deal but remained vague about outcomes. The meeting is expected to start at 11 a.m. Alaska Time (3 p.m. ET) at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Trump hinted at a second meeting involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and possibly European leaders. European leaders have urged Putin to agree to a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine before any peace talks. Trump and Putin will hold a joint press conference at the end of the summit. Trump has expressed frustration with Putin's past actions and hinted at severe consequences for Russia if it does not stop the war. Trump has discussed a potential land swap between Russia and Ukraine, but Zelenskyy strongly opposes ceding territory, citing Ukraine's constitution.
