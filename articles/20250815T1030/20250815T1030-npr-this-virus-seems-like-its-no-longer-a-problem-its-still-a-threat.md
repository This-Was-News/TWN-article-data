## Article summary
Mpox, once a major global health concern, continues to pose a significant threat, particularly in Africa. Despite initial alarm and efforts in 2022 and 2023, the virus has spread rapidly across 24 African countries, with over 97,000 suspected cases and nearly 600 deaths this year. The World Health Organization declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern a year ago, but critics argue the global response has been inadequate. A new strain, clade 1b, has emerged, spreading among sex workers and their clients, with the Democratic Republic of Congo as the epicenter. Data on cases is likely underreported due to stigma, remote locations, and reduced foreign aid. Vaccination efforts have fallen short, with only about 886,000 people vaccinated across a dozen African countries. The U.S. promised 1 million doses but has delivered only 90,000, with many doses expiring. Experts warn that the lack of a robust response could undermine future disease control efforts and the WHO's alert system. While some progress has been made in building capacity and coordination, much more work is needed to contain the virus and prevent further outbreaks.
