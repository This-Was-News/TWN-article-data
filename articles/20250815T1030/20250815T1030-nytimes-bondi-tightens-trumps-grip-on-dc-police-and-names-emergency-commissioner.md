## Article summary
Attorney General Pam Bond rescinded restrictions on Washington police, allowing them to engage in immigration enforcement, and named Terry Cole, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as the emergency police commissioner. This move tightens the Trump administration's control over the city's police department and conflicts with local authorities. The order requires the police department to seek approval from Cole before issuing directives, aiming to transform Washington from a sanctuary city into one that aggressively pursues undocumented immigrants. D.C. Attorney General Bran Schwalb advised Mayor Muriel Bowser that Bond's directive was unlawful, citing the 1973 Home Rule Act. Bowser agreed, stating that no statute conveys the district's personnel authority to a federal official. The conflict threatens to disrupt the cooperative relationship between the city's Democratic leadership and the Republican administration. Bond's order invalidates city regulations that prohibit police from arresting individuals solely for being undocumented immigrants and bans cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The president's border czar, Tom Homan, stated that federal control in D.C. would negate local laws limiting cooperation with deportation efforts. The F.B.I. reported 45 arrests during overnight patrols, with 29 being immigration-related, though details were not provided. Washington's sanctuary city law restricts local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement unless a federal criminal charge is involved.
