## Article summary
Malnourished children are arriving daily at Gaza's Nasser Hospital, with cases like 2½-year-old Roa Mash, who died of severe malnutrition despite having no pre-existing conditions. Her family struggled to find food and treatment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denies hunger in Gaza, attributing reports to Hamas propaganda. The U.N. warns of unprecedented malnutrition levels, with nearly 12,000 children under 5 affected in July. Israel recently tripled food entry after a 2½-month blockade but prices remain high. Experts warn that increased food supply won't help severely malnourished children who need hospital care. The Gaza Health Ministry reports 42 children died of malnutrition-related causes since July. Doctors acknowledge some cases involve pre-existing conditions but blame food shortages for rapid deterioration. Nasser Hospital receives 10-20 severely malnourished children daily, with cases like 2-year-old Shamm Qudeh, who finally received permission to seek treatment abroad. Families face displacement and interrupted care, exacerbating malnutrition. The situation is dire, with ongoing conflict threatening further displacement and food delivery disruptions.
