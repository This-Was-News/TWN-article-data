With over two decades of experience working alongside Musk at various companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, Davis has developed a reputation for cost-cutting and innovative problem-solving.

Musk has likened Davis to chemotherapy, emphasizing his ability to eliminate waste, though this has sometimes led to mistakes. Davis has faced challenges, including regulatory hurdles while overseeing projects and managing layoffs at companies like Twitter. He has also played a role in political campaigns, helping to organize efforts to support Trump during the presidential election. Despite his significant influence, Davis has preferred to remain out of the spotlight, avoiding media attention until recently.
