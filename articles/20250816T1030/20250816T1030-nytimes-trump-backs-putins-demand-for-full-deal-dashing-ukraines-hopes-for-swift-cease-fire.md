## Article summary
President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed a potential peace deal for Ukraine, bypassing a cease-fire, which Trump claimed was agreed upon by all parties. European leaders, however, issued a statement not endorsing this approach and threatened increased economic penalties on Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced he would meet Trump in Washington to discuss ending the war. The Alaska summit between Trump and Putin yielded no concrete deal, with Russia holding a battlefield advantage over Ukraine. European leaders reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and their determination to pressure Russia economically. Trump's stance on peace talks without a cease-fire favors Russia's position, while Ukraine seeks a cease-fire before negotiations. The summit was seen as a public relations victory for Putin, with Trump inviting him into his limousine, an unusual gesture. The International Criminal Court's warrant for Putin's arrest highlights the limited travel options for the Russian leader, with the U.S. being one of the few Western nations he can visit without risk. Putin flattered Trump by echoing his claims about the war in Ukraine, stating that it would not have happened under Trump's presidency. In Russia, the summit was portrayed as a triumph for Putin, with state media emphasizing the warm relationship between the two leaders and the perceived breakthrough in negotiations.
