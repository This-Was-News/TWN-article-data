## Article summary
President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a high-profile summit in Alaska but reached no agreement to end the war in Ukraine. While Trump hoped for an immediate cease-fire, both leaders acknowledged progress but no concrete deal. The meeting was marked by warm interactions, with Trump rolling out a red carpet and applauding Putin, despite the latter facing U.S. sanctions and an international arrest warrant for war crimes. Both leaders praised each other, with Putin inviting Trump to Moscow. However, the meeting ended with uncertainty, as neither leader provided details on the discussions or took questions from reporters. Democrats criticized the summit, arguing it legitimized Putin's actions. The meeting was seen as a diplomatic gamble by Trump and a victory for Putin, who made no public commitment to stop the assault on Ukraine. The summit was the seventh in-person encounter between the two leaders and the first of Trump's second term. Despite the lack of a deal, both leaders expressed optimism about future progress.
