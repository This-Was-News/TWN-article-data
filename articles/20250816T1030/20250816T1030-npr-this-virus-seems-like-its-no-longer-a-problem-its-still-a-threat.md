## Article summary
Mpox, once a major global health concern in 2022 and 2023, has seen a significant decline in cases in 2025, but it remains a threat, particularly in Africa. The virus has spread rapidly across 24 African countries, with over 97,000 suspected cases and nearly 600 deaths this year. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern a year ago, but critics argue the global response has been inadequate despite $1.1 billion in pledged support. The virus, initially associated with remote forested areas, has evolved, with a new strain spreading among sex workers and their clients, primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries. Data on cases is likely underreported due to stigma, limited surveillance, and reduced foreign aid. Vaccination efforts have been insufficient, with only about 886,000 people vaccinated across a dozen African countries. The U.S. promised 1 million vaccine doses but has only delivered about 90,000, with many doses nearing expiration. Experts warn that the lack of a robust response could undermine future efforts to contain mpox and other disease threats, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and investment in global health infrastructure.
