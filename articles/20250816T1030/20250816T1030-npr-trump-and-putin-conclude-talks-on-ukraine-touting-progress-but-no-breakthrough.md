President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held high-stakes talks in Alaska aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Both leaders touted progress but did not announce any concrete steps toward a ceasefire. Trump mentioned making some headway but noted that there was no deal yet, with a few sticking points to resolve. He plans to reach out to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders next. Putin expressed interest in ending the war but emphasized the need to address Russia's legitimate concerns. The summit, marked by a dramatic entrance with fighter jets overhead, concluded with statements but no Q&A session. Trump showed a book of prisoners and another of war casualties presented by Putin. Trump rated the meeting a 10 out of 10 for showing superpower cooperation. Putin suggested a future meeting in Moscow, which Trump found interesting. Protesters outside the base held Ukrainian flags during the talks.
