## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday following a U.S.-Russia summit that did not result in a peace agreement for Ukraine. Trump stated that the summit in Alaska went well and that all parties agreed a peace agreement, rather than a ceasefire, is the best way to end the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously expressed interest in a long-term settlement that considers Moscow's interests. Zelenskyy mentioned having a substantial conversation with Trump and thanked him for the invitation to discuss ending the killing and the war. This will be Zelenskyy's first visit to the U.S. since a tense meeting with Trump in February. Trump confirmed the White House meeting and hinted at a potential future meeting with Putin. Despite rolling out the red carpet for Putin, Trump provided few details about the summit's discussions. He had previously warned of severe consequences for Russia if Putin did not agree to end the war.
