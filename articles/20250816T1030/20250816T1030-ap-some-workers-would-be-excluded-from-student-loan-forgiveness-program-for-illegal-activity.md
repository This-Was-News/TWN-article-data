## Article summary
A new federal proposal by the Trump administration aims to exclude certain public workers, including teachers, social workers, and nurses, from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program if their employers engage in activities deemed illegal. The proposal, released by the Education Department, targets nonprofits or government bodies working with immigrants and transgender youth, raising concerns about political retaliation. The Education Secretary would have the final say in determining which organizations are excluded, with illegal activities including child trafficking, illegal immigration, and supporting foreign terrorist organizations. The proposal also defines chemical castration, which includes gender-affirming care for transgender youth, as an illegal activity. President Trump ordered these changes in March, citing national security concerns. The public has 30 days to comment on the proposal before it is finalized, with changes taking effect in July 2026. Critics argue the proposal is an attempt to weaponize student loan forgiveness for political purposes, while the Education Department predicts minimal impact on the overall program. Organizations involved in gender-affirming care in states where it is outlawed could be particularly affected. The proposal also allows the Education Secretary to independently determine if an organization should be ejected based on a preponderance of evidence.
