## Article summary
Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, have expressed support for the mass relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, framing it as a voluntary humanitarian measure. Netanyahu has presented this as a condition for ending the ongoing war with Hamas, which began with Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack. Israel is in talks with African countries, some of which are facing their own wars and famines, about potentially hosting Palestinian refugees. However, Palestinians argue that leaving their homeland under these circumstances would not be voluntary and would amount to forced expulsion, violating international law. As Israel widens its military campaign in Gaza, more Palestinians are being displaced, with some vowing not to leave their ancestral homes. Israeli leaders have stated that they are preparing plans to facilitate the departure of Gaza residents, including options for land crossings and sea or air departures. Netanyahu has emphasized that the relocation plan is part of a broader strategy to ensure Israel's security and demilitarize Gaza. Despite these plans, Palestinians like Ismail Zaydah, whose family has remained in Gaza City throughout the war, refuse to surrender their land and homes.
