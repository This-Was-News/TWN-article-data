## Article summary
President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska failed to reach an agreement on ending the conflict in Ukraine. The lack of a deal was met with relief by Ukrainians and European neighbors, who feared Trump might concede to Putin's territorial demands. Trump left without securing a temporary cease-fire, which he had previously stated would be unsatisfactory. Both leaders were vague about future steps, with Putin suggesting a path to ending the conflict without detailing it, and Trump placing the onus on Ukrainian President Zelensky to achieve a cease-fire. Trump praised Putin, commiserating over U.S. investigations into Russian election interference. The meeting lacked substance, with no questions taken from reporters and no clear framework for a cease-fire. Trump's warm welcome of Putin, despite his pariah status, drew comparisons to his meetings with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, which were high on atmosphere but low on substance. Putin emerged from the meeting with renewed legitimacy, defusing talk of sanctions and gaining time without conceding anything. The meeting highlighted Trump's personal rapport with Putin, overshadowing the lack of progress on the Ukraine conflict.
