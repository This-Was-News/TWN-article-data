## Article summary
California Democrats have proposed a new congressional map that could give their party up to five new seats, countering Republican efforts in Texas. Governor Gavin Newsom supports this plan and plans to call a special election on November 4 for voters to decide on the new districts, bypassing the state's independent redistricting commission. Newsom argues that California must respond to Texas Republicans' redistricting efforts, which aim to gain more GOP seats. The proposed map targets five Republican representatives, potentially turning their districts bluer. California lawmakers will vote on the map on August 21. Meanwhile, Texas Democrats, who left the state to block a Republican redistricting vote, may now return as their efforts have delayed but not stopped the new map. Newsom's plan includes a trigger clause, making it effective only if Texas or another red state proceeds with its redistricting. Critics argue the plan lacks transparency and undermines the independent commission, but Newsom maintains it is transparent as voters will have the final say. Other blue states like New York and Illinois are considering similar measures, while Republican states like Ohio and Florida see more potential gains.
