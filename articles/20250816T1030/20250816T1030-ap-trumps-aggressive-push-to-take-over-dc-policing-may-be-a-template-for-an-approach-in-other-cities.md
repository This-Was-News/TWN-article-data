## Article summary
President Donald Trump's aggressive push to take over Washington, D.C.'s law enforcement has sparked intense debate. The left views it as a march towards autocracy, while the right sees it as a bold move to improve the city. Trump deployed National Guard troops and attempted to seize control of the police department, which local officials challenged in court. A judge urged a compromise, leading to a partial retreat by the Trump administration. Despite this, Trump's Justice Department directed the police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The deployment of the National Guard and the attempt to control the police department have been controversial, with local officials and many citizens opposing them. Trump's use of emergency language to justify his actions has been consistent with his other policies. Washington, D.C., like many cities, faces crime and homelessness, but there was no widespread urban unrest justifying Trump's actions. The city's unique status as a federal district and a symbol of American democracy adds to the significance of Trump's interventions. Critics, including Philadelphia's District Attorney Larry Krasner and activists, have denounced Trump's actions as authoritarian. The Home Rule Act allows a president to invoke emergency powers over the police department for 30 days, with Congress deciding on an extension. Some Republicans in Congress are considering giving Trump even more authority. The question remains whether Trump's approach in D.C. will serve as a model for other cities he believes need to be 'fixed.'
