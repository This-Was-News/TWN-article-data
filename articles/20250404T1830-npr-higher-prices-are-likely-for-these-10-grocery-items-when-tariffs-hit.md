## Article summary
Higher prices for various grocery items are anticipated due to new tariffs announced by President Trump, affecting imports from several countries. Economists predict that items such as seafood, coffee, wine, nuts, and cheese will see significant price increases. The tariffs, which include a 10% tax on many imports, could impact nearly half of supermarket products, according to food industry analysts. Factors like increased fertilizer costs and a weaker U.S. dollar will also contribute to rising food prices. 

Key items likely to be affected include seafood from countries like Chile and Vietnam, coffee from Brazil and Colombia, and various fruits from Central America. Alcoholic beverages, particularly wine and beer, will face higher prices due to tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico. Beef and rice prices may also rise, despite most of these products being domestically produced. Cheese imports from Europe are expected to become pricier as well, alongside nuts from Vietnam and Côte d'Ivoire. Olive oil prices, particularly from Spain and Italy, are also projected to increase significantly. Overall, the tariffs will have broad implications for grocery prices and availability.
