## Article summary
The article discusses the increasing divide between the U.S. and Europe, particularly following the return of Donald Trump to the presidency. It highlights five key developments that illustrate this growing rift, beginning with Vice President JD Vance's critical remarks toward European leaders at the Munich Security Conference. Vance's controversial meeting with far-right German politician Alice Weidel further fueled tensions, prompting a strong response from German officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a unified European military force to counter Russian aggression, expressing concerns that the U.S. might negotiate a peace deal without Ukraine's involvement. 

Additionally, Secretary of State Marco Rubio's separate talks with Russian officials, which excluded Ukrainian representatives, raised alarms in Europe about U.S. intentions. European leaders are increasingly worried about Trump's commitment to NATO and the potential abandonment of mutual defense pledges. The article also notes that the U.S. recently voted against a UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, aligning itself with countries like North Korea and Iran. Overall, the growing distrust highlights a significant shift in transatlantic relations and European leaders' urgency to bolster their own defense capabilities in light of uncertain U.S. support.
