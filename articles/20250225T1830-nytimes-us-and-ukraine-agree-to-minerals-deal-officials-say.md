## Article summary
The U.S. and Ukraine have reached an agreement regarding mineral resources, following pressure from President Trump for Ukraine to provide revenue from these resources. The deal, which President Zelensky is expected to sign in Washington, marks a significant shift in U.S.-Ukraine relations towards a more transactional approach. While specific terms of the agreement remain unclear, it is reported that Ukraine will contribute half of its revenues from natural resource monetization to a fund, with the U.S. retaining maximum financial interest as allowed by law.

Initially, the negotiations faced challenges, including Zelensky's demands for security guarantees and Trump's insistence on substantial financial returns for past military aid. However, recent drafts have removed some stringent conditions, such as a $500 billion contribution and repayment terms on future aid, which Zelensky had rejected as burdensome. The Ukrainian president has expressed concerns about the implications of the deal, particularly in light of ongoing Russian aggression.

Despite the absence of explicit security guarantees, U.S. officials argue that American economic interests in Ukraine could deter future threats from Russia. Zelensky acknowledged the pressure to finalize the agreement, indicating a potential lack of alternatives for Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict. Critics of the deal highlight that it overlooks the sacrifices Ukraine has made for European security in its fight against Russian expansion.
