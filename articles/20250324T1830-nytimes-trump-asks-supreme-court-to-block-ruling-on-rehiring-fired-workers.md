## Article summary
The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to block a federal judge's ruling that mandates the rehiring of over 16,000 probationary federal workers who were terminated. The emergency application highlights a growing trend of lower court judges issuing injunctions that the administration argues exceed their authority and disrupt government programs. Acting Solicitor General Sarah M. Harris noted that federal judges have issued numerous restraining orders against the administration, with a significant number occurring during the early years of the Biden administration. The injunction in question was issued by Judge William H. Alsup of the Northern District of California, who stated that the Office of Personnel Management lacked the authority to terminate employees across various federal agencies. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declined to pause Alsup's order while the government appeals. Additionally, a separate ruling from Judge James K. Bredar in Maryland also called for the reinstatement of federal workers, further complicating the administration's position. Harris emphasized that these rulings violate the separation of powers and impose undue burdens on executive functions. The administration seeks to halt what it describes as an ongoing assault on its constitutional authority and is pushing for the Supreme Court's intervention.
