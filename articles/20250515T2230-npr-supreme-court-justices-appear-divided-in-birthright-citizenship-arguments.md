## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard arguments regarding the Trump administration's attempt to limit birthright citizenship, which guarantees automatic citizenship to all babies born in the U.S. The justices appeared divided on whether federal district courts have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions against the administration's policies. Justice Brett Kavanaugh questioned how the government would enforce Trump's order, while Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed concern that such an order would undermine the justice system. Conversely, Justice Clarence Thomas was more supportive of the administration's stance, noting the absence of nationwide injunctions before the 1960s. 

New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum argued for the availability of nationwide injunctions in specific cases, while Kelsi Corkran suggested they should only apply when constitutional violations are claimed. President Trump has long argued that the Constitution does not guarantee birthright citizenship and issued an executive order during his second presidential term to prevent automatic citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. This order has faced challenges in court, with three federal judges deeming it "blatantly unconstitutional." Despite the lack of support for Trump's legal claim, the administration has taken the case to the Supreme Court, focusing on the jurisdiction of federal judges rather than the order's legality. The situation continues to develop.
