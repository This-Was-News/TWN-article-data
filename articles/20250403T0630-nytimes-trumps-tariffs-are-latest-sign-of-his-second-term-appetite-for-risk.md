## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's bold approach in his second term, marked by the recent imposition of sweeping global tariffs. Despite concerns over inflation and economic stability, Trump remains unconcerned about potential price surges, indicating a willingness to take significant risks. His administration has shifted from cautious advisers to enablers, allowing him to pursue a more aggressive agenda, including dismantling longstanding alliances and cutting funding for research institutions. Trump's strategy appears to prioritize economic protectionism, betting that American consumers will accept higher prices to bring jobs back to the U.S. He believes that other countries will respond favorably to his tariffs and that they will create new revenue streams for the government. However, experts caution that these policies could negatively impact markets and economic growth. Trump's unpredictable style suggests he may adjust tariffs based on market reactions, maintaining flexibility in negotiations. Ultimately, he prioritizes economic relationships over diplomatic partnerships, challenging traditional alliances in pursuit of his goals.
