## Article summary
The Supreme Court has intervened in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador. A federal judge had ordered the Trump administration to return him by midnight, citing a lack of legal justification for his deportation. The Justice Department appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction since Garcia was in El Salvador, but the Supreme Court stayed the judge's order pending further review. Abrego Garcia had lived in Maryland for over a decade under a legal protection known as 'withholding of removal' before his deportation. The White House claims he is affiliated with the MS-13 gang, but his lawyers dispute this, noting he has no criminal record. Judge Paula Xinis described the accusations as vague and criticized the administration for failing to provide substantial evidence. The Justice Department's assertion that it had no control over Garcia's situation was rebuffed by the court, which highlighted the potential for government overreach. A panel from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals also rejected the government's emergency stay request, emphasizing the importance of due process. The case raises significant concerns about the government's authority in deportation cases and the rights of individuals legally present in the U.S.
