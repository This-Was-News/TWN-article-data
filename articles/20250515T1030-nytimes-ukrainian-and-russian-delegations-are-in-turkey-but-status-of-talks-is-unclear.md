## Article summary
Officials from Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey for anticipated peace talks, but the situation became unclear as delegations arrived in different cities, and President Putin did not attend, sending midlevel officials instead. President Zelensky of Ukraine arrived in Ankara for discussions with Turkey's president and indicated that Ukraine would decide on a meeting after their lunch. Russia's Foreign Ministry announced a postponement of talks at Turkey's request, and Ukraine criticized the low rank of the Russian delegation. Zelensky emphasized the need to understand the Russian delegation's authority before proceeding with discussions. The backdrop of the talks included differing approaches to ending the conflict: Zelensky sought an immediate cease-fire, while Putin demanded major concessions before halting military actions. President Trump, also in the Middle East, expressed interest in the talks, suggesting he might come to Turkey if progress was made. The diplomatic landscape has shifted rapidly, with Trump attempting to broker peace while pressuring Kyiv and facing criticism for his handling of U.S. support for Ukraine. Russia's demands include control over territories and limitations on Ukraine's military, while Ukraine aims to freeze the conflict and maintain its sovereignty without accepting military restrictions. The ongoing war has led to significant casualties, and both sides have accused each other of cease-fire violations.
