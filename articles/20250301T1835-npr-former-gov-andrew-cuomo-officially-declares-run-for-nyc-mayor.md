## Article summary
Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has officially announced his candidacy for New York City mayor, marking his return to electoral politics after a tumultuous resignation in 2021 amid multiple sexual harassment allegations. In a video, he expressed concerns about the city's current state, highlighting issues such as homelessness, crime, and economic decline, and called for a bold action plan to revitalize NYC. Cuomo enters a competitive Democratic primary, facing incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and other challengers, including city Comptroller Brad Lander and state Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani. 

Despite a history of significant achievements during his governorship, including the legalization of same-sex marriage and major infrastructure projects, Cuomo's campaign is overshadowed by ongoing scandals, including harassment claims and controversies surrounding his handling of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. Critics quickly responded to his announcement, emphasizing the need for new leadership and condemning Cuomo's past actions. Polls indicate that Cuomo currently leads among Democratic candidates, benefiting from his high name recognition. The primary election is scheduled for June 24, 2025, and Cuomo's campaign will face scrutiny as it unfolds amid a backdrop of legal challenges and public skepticism.
