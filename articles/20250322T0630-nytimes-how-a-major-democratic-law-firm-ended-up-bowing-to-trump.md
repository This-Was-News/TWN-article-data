## Article summary
The New York Times article discusses the surprising decision of Brad S. Karp, chairman of the prominent Democratic law firm Paul Weiss, to make a deal with President Trump after being targeted by an executive order. Karp had been a vocal opponent of Trump’s policies during his first term and had previously organized efforts against the administration, including fundraising for Biden. However, faced with the potential threat to his firm, which generates substantial revenue and serves major corporate clients, Karp shifted his approach and agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services to causes favored by Trump. The deal also included a commitment to abandon diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, though this was disputed by Karp later. 

The decision has left many in the legal community unsettled, as it suggests that even powerful firms might capitulate to Trump's intimidation tactics rather than engage in legal battles. Karp's move has drawn criticism from both within his firm and externally, with some clients expressing dismay and considering withdrawing their business. Trump's continued targeting of law firms raises concerns about the implications for legal practices that oppose him. The article highlights the tension between financial survival and adherence to legal principles in the current political climate.
