## Article summary
The article discusses former President Trump's claims that President Biden's pardons are invalid due to the alleged use of an autopen for signing. Trump stated that the pardons, which were issued for members of the Jan. 6 investigation panel, are "void" because they were signed by a machine rather than by Biden himself. This assertion lacks evidence and has been fueled by conspiracy theories regarding Biden's cognitive abilities. Legal experts indicate that even if an autopen was used, it does not necessarily invalidate the pardons, as constitutional provisions do not require a written signature for pardons to take effect. The article explains that autopens have been used by many presidents over the years, including notable figures like Thomas Jefferson and Barack Obama, to efficiently manage their correspondence. The use of autopens is a common practice in the White House, allowing leaders to focus on more pressing issues. Ultimately, the discussion around the validity of Biden's pardons based on the autopen issue is viewed as a distraction rather than a legitimate legal concern.
