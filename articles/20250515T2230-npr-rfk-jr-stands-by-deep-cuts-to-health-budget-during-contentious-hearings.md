## Article summary
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended significant budget cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) during contentious congressional hearings. He acknowledged that the budget overhaul, influenced by Elon Musk's DOGE initiative, has led to the dismissal or buyout of 20,000 employees. While Kennedy stood by the sweeping changes, he did mention reinstating some mistakenly cut programs. The hearings, which addressed President Trump's fiscal year 2026 budget, also touched on autism research and a measles outbreak in Texas.

Kennedy faced tough questioning, particularly regarding his stance on vaccines, where he was criticized for undermining public trust. He used a metaphor about swimming in a lake with alligators to explain his cautious approach. Senator Bill Cassidy urged collaboration between Congress and the administration to ensure effective reforms. Kennedy's responses were at times vague, especially concerning specific cuts and delays in community payments. The hearings included interruptions from protestors and highlighted tensions between Democrats and Republicans over funding and program reinstatements.
