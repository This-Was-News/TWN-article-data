## Article summary
Two Israeli Embassy aides, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside a reception at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., by Elias Rodriguez, a 30-year-old man who shouted pro-Palestinian slogans after his arrest. The shooting occurred shortly after 9 p.m. as the couple was leaving the event, which was attended by young diplomats. Rodriguez was detained shortly after the incident, and authorities stated there was no ongoing threat to public safety. Israeli officials expressed outrage, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling for increased security for diplomatic missions. The Israeli foreign minister attributed the attack to antisemitic incitement linked to recent violence in the region. Responses included condemnation from political figures, including President Trump and Mayor Muriel Bowser, who emphasized the need to combat hate and violence. The shooting has raised concerns amid ongoing pro-Palestinian protests, which some critics claim incite violence against Jews. The police described the attack as targeted violence, and the FBI is involved in the investigation. The event was part of an initiative to connect young Jewish professionals with humanitarian efforts in the Middle East.
