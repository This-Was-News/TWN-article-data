## Article summary
The recent confrontation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlights a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine. During a heated meeting, Trump asserted his alignment with the interests of the United States rather than traditional alliances, indicating a transactional approach to foreign relations. The U.S. sided with Russia at the United Nations on the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, further complicating relations with European allies. Zelenskyy sought stronger security guarantees for Ukraine, which Trump has been reluctant to provide, leading to tensions between the two leaders. Trump's comments suggested a desire for peace without American involvement, implying that Zelenskyy's reliance on U.S. support could hinder negotiations. The potential minerals deal discussed during the meeting now appears uncertain. Trump's administration has shifted its stance on NATO and security commitments, emphasizing that such guarantees are primarily Europe's responsibility. This week has marked a notable departure from longstanding U.S. foreign policy principles established since World War II, raising concerns about future international alliances and support for Ukraine amidst ongoing conflict with Russia.
