## Article summary
Mikal Mahdi was executed by firing squad in South Carolina on April 11, but an autopsy revealed that none of the bullets hit his heart, leading to prolonged suffering. The autopsy showed two wounds to his chest, which caused damage to internal organs but allowed his heart to continue beating. Forensic pathologists indicated that Mahdi likely experienced excruciating pain for 30 to 60 seconds before dying. His lawyers have labeled the execution as "botched," arguing that it violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The South Carolina Supreme Court previously ruled that firing squad executions were not cruel, assuming a quick death unless a significant failure occurred. Eyewitness accounts confirmed that Mahdi reacted and groaned after being shot, suggesting he was alive longer than expected. There is uncertainty regarding why only two wounds were present instead of three, as all shooters were supposed to fire live rounds. Mahdi's lawyers are seeking to prevent similar executions in the future, emphasizing the need for accountability. Other states also permit firing squad executions, with future cases pending in Mississippi.
