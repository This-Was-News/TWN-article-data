## Article summary
A judge has criticized the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deporting Venezuelans suspected of gang affiliation, stating that the treatment of these deportees is worse than that of Nazis during World War II. Judge Patricia Millett highlighted that deportees were not given proper notice or hearings, unlike those under the Alien Enemies Act in the past. The D.C. Circuit Court is reviewing the government's appeal to lift a temporary restraining order on these deportations, which was imposed by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. The Justice Department argues that the pause on deportations is an overreach of judicial power that could harm international relations. Millett expressed sympathy for immigrant rights advocates, emphasizing the necessity of due process before deportations occur. Meanwhile, the government maintains that individuals can contest their detention through habeas petitions. Judge Justin Walker supported the government's stance, suggesting plaintiffs should have filed in Texas where the detainees are held. The ongoing legal battle underscores the tension between executive power and individual rights in immigration enforcement. The court's decision may set a precedent for how wartime powers are applied in contemporary immigration policy.
