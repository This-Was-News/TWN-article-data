## Article summary
The NPR article discusses the significant impact of minor legal infractions on international students in the U.S. under the Trump administration. Thousands of students faced visa record terminations due to past encounters with law enforcement, including minor offenses such as traffic violations. This sudden action by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) left many students unable to work or continue their studies, causing widespread chaos and distress. Some students reported losing jobs and being forced to leave the country. Immigration lawyers criticized the lack of due process in how ICE handled these terminations, arguing that many students were unfairly flagged for minor or dismissed charges. In response to legal challenges, the Justice Department announced that ICE would restore the terminated records for the time being. However, a new policy was suggested that could make it easier for ICE to revoke student status in the future. The article highlights the fear and uncertainty among international students, many of whom are now reconsidering their futures in the U.S. due to these actions. Overall, the situation underscores the precarious nature of immigration status for students with any interaction with law enforcement.
