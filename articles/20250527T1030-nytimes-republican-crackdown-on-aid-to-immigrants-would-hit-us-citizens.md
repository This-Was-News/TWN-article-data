## Article summary
The Republican administration under President Trump is implementing measures to restrict federal benefits for undocumented immigrants, claiming it will redirect resources to American citizens in need. These changes include enhanced immigration verification for food stamps and limitations on Medicaid, Medicare, and tax credits for certain immigrant families. Immigration experts warn that the real impact will be felt by U.S. citizen children with undocumented parents, who are more likely to live in poverty. The tax bill passed by House Republicans would restrict the child tax credit and tighten eligibility for health insurance programs, potentially harming both documented and undocumented families. Critics argue that these policies could undermine the well-being of U.S. citizen children and create barriers to essential services. Additionally, federal agencies are already taking steps to ensure undocumented immigrants do not benefit from housing and unemployment programs, leading to fears of family separation and homelessness. The changes may discourage eligible families from seeking benefits due to concerns over immigration enforcement. Overall, the crackdown is seen as a punitive measure that could adversely affect many U.S. citizens while failing to achieve significant budget savings.
