## Article summary
Grocery shoppers are expected to experience price increases in the produce aisle due to new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, effective soon. Key items affected include bananas from Guatemala and grapes from Peru, which will see a 10% tariff. Seafood, particularly shrimp from Vietnam and India, faces even steeper tariffs of 46% and 26%, respectively. Other staples like sugar and coffee are also anticipated to rise in price, with specialty coffee potentially increasing by 10% to 35%. Retailers may absorb some costs initially, but the overall impact is likely to manifest over the next year, leading to higher prices across the board. Smaller food producers may struggle to adapt, while larger companies are better positioned to manage these changes. Uncertainties around tariffs are causing businesses to reassess their operations and pricing strategies. Consumers are advised to stock up on goods before prices rise, especially for items that are harder to store. The situation is compounded by logistical challenges and the need for proper documentation regarding tariff costs.
