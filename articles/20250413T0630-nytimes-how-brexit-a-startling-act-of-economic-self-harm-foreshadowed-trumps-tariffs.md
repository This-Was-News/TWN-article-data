## Article summary
The article discusses the parallels between Brexit and Donald Trump's tariffs, highlighting the economic isolationism both represent. Since the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK has faced significant economic challenges, with estimates showing trade volume and productivity significantly lower than if it had remained in the EU. Trump's recent tariff decisions echo Britain's struggles, particularly with market volatility and investor confidence. The impact of Brexit has been multifaceted, affecting Britain's economy, political landscape, and its role on the global stage. Critics argue that Brexit has not solved the UK's economic issues and has instead exacerbated them, leading to a divided Conservative Party. The article draws connections between the ideological divides within the Brexit movement and Trump's MAGA coalition, raising questions about the future of the Republican Party post-Trump. Ultimately, both Brexit and Trump's tariffs illustrate the dangers of economic self-harm and the complexities of national policy in a globalized world. The article concludes by suggesting that the long-term effects of these decisions will continue to shape the political and economic landscapes in both the UK and the US.
