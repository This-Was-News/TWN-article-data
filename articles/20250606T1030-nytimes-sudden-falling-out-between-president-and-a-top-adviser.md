## Article summary
The alliance between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, which had once seemed unlikely yet powerful, has rapidly unraveled into public conflict. Their dispute ignited over Trump's domestic policy bill, which Musk criticized harshly, leading to a series of personal attacks on social media. Trump threatened to revoke government contracts worth billions for Musk's companies, while Musk suggested the formation of a new political party and hinted at supporting Trump's impeachment. The fallout jeopardizes Musk's financial contributions to Trump's 2024 campaign and threatens Trump's political standing, as both men risk losing support from their respective allies. Tensions escalated with Musk claiming credit for Trump's election victory, while Trump downplayed Musk's contributions. The public spat resulted in significant stock drops for both Tesla and Trump's media company. Despite Musk's attempts at de-escalation, the conflict reflects deep fractures in their once-close partnership, which had included Musk's involvement in government efficiency initiatives. The situation has left many in Musk's circle surprised and concerned about the implications of this bitter breakup.
