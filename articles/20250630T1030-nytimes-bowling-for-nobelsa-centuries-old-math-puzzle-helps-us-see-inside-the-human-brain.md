## Article summary
The article discusses the fascinating relationship between triangular numbers and the development of calculus, which ultimately led to advancements in medical imaging, specifically CT scans. Triangular numbers, such as 1, 3, 6, and 10, are formed by arranging objects in a triangular pattern. The mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz made significant contributions to mathematics in 1672 by exploring the sum of the reciprocals of triangular numbers, discovering a pattern that allowed him to simplify the calculations. His work laid the groundwork for calculus, a systematic framework that has since been applied to various fields.

The article then transitions to the invention of CT scans in the late 1960s by Godfrey Hounsfield, who proposed a method to visualize the brain by firing multiple beams through the skull and using mathematical reconstruction to deduce internal structures. Despite skepticism, Hounsfield's prototype successfully imaged a brain with a tumor, demonstrating the effectiveness of his approach. His contributions, along with those of physicist Allan Cormack, earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1979. The article concludes by emphasizing that the exploration of triangular numbers set off a chain of mathematical discoveries that have profoundly impacted science and medicine.
