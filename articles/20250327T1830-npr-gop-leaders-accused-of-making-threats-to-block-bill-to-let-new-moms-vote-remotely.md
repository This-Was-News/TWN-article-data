## Article summary
GOP leaders are facing accusations from Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna of using threats and bribery to block her proposed bill that would allow new parents to vote by proxy for 12 weeks after childbirth. Luna, who has given birth while serving in the House, argues that the current voting rules do not accommodate the needs of new parents. House Speaker Mike Johnson opposes the bill on constitutional grounds, stating that proxy voting could undermine tradition within Congress. Despite this, Luna has garnered bipartisan support, including from Democratic Congresswoman Brittany Pettersen, and they have utilized a discharge petition to force a vote on the legislation.

Luna claims that GOP leaders have attempted to dissuade lawmakers from supporting the bill through various means, including offers of committee positions and threats regarding fundraising support. Pettersen expressed frustration over the tactics being employed to derail their efforts, highlighting the broad support the initiative has received. Johnson, however, maintains that allowing proxy voting opens a "Pandora's box" for Congress. The bill is seen as a necessary modernization of Congress to better accommodate young families, with both Luna and Pettersen advocating for a more inclusive legislative environment. The timeline for a vote remains uncertain, but Luna is determined to push for the change.
