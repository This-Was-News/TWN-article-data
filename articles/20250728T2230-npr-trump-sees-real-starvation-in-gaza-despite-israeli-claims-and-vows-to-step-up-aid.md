## Article summary
President Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer discussed increasing aid to Gaza amid reports of widespread hunger. Trump's remarks contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who denied starvation in Gaza. The UN reports that a third of Gaza's population faces days without food, with a surge in malnutrition-related deaths. Trump vowed to intensify U.S. involvement after seeing distressing images of starving children. The crisis stems from nearly 22 months of conflict between Israel and Hamas, with Israel recently agreeing to pause fighting to allow more aid into Gaza.
