## Article summary
The Senate recently passed its budget resolution after an extensive overnight voting session known as a "vote-a-rama." This resolution serves as a framework for implementing President Trump's legislative agenda, allocating $175 billion for border security and $150 billion for military funding. However, it conflicts with the House's approach, which seeks to combine priorities into a single bill rather than tackle them separately. The Senate's resolution requires further detailed work by committees to finalize spending and offsets.

Senator Rand Paul was the only Republican to oppose the resolution, citing concerns over increasing the deficit. The voting session allowed Democrats to push for amendments, including those aimed at preventing tax cuts for the wealthy and protecting Medicaid funding, though these efforts ultimately failed. President Trump expressed gratitude for the Senate's support of his border agenda, while House Majority Leader Steve Scalise plans to present the House's budget resolution soon.

Both chambers are utilizing the budget resolution as part of a reconciliation process that enables them to pass significant portions of Trump's agenda without Democratic support. The urgency is heightened as the 2017 tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025, necessitating alignment between the Senate and House resolutions.
