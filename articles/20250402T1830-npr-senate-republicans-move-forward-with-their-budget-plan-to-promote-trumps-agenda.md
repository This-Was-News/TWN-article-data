## Article summary
Senate Republicans have introduced a budget plan aimed at advancing President Trump's domestic agenda, which includes a proposal to raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion and make previous tax cuts permanent. The 70-page resolution, released by Sen. Lindsey Graham, is set for a vote soon and is seen as a critical step toward fulfilling Republican promises on border security, national defense, and fiscal policy. Senate Majority Leader John Thune emphasized the plan's potential to facilitate significant investments and prevent a looming tax increase. 

However, the plan faces challenges, including opposition from House Republicans who are concerned about spending cuts and the debt ceiling increase. Some conservatives in the House demand a more stringent approach to spending, complicating potential support for the Senate's proposal. The Republicans are leveraging the reconciliation process to pass the budget with a simple majority, but procedural hurdles remain. 

Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have criticized the proposal, arguing it would lead to severe cuts in essential programs and benefit the wealthy disproportionately. Despite the obstacles, Senate leaders remain optimistic about moving forward with their agenda.
