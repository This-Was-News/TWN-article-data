## Article summary
U.S. and China trade talks have commenced in Geneva, marking the first in-person discussions since President Trump imposed significant tariffs on Chinese goods. Led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the U.S. delegation also includes Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, while China's participation is confirmed by Vice Premier He Lifeng. The meetings aim to address the economic tensions that have disrupted trade and impacted financial markets. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed hope that the talks would lead to constructive outcomes beneficial for global commerce. Despite the optimistic setting, experts suggest that a quick resolution is unlikely, with initial discussions potentially leading to prolonged negotiations. Bessent initially visited Geneva to negotiate a separate trade arrangement with Switzerland, which is also keen on facilitating U.S.-China dialogue. The ongoing trade war continues to weigh heavily on economic forecasts, prompting both nations to explore potential compromises. As the talks unfold, each side will likely assess what concessions they are willing to make. Overall, these discussions represent a critical step in addressing the complexities of the ongoing trade conflict.
