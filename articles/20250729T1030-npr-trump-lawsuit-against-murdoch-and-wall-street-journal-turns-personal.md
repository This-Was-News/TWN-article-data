## Article summary
President Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch and the *Wall Street Journal*, alleging that the newspaper published a fake birthday greeting he supposedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump claims he personally warned Murdoch about the falsity of the story, but it was published anyway. He is now seeking to compel Murdoch to testify under oath within 15 days, citing Murdoch's advanced age and health issues as reasons for urgency. The lawsuit highlights the strained relationship between the two former allies, with Trump accusing Murdoch of directing the publication of defamatory content. Meanwhile, the *Journal* has continued to report on Trump's connections to Epstein, further escalating tensions.
