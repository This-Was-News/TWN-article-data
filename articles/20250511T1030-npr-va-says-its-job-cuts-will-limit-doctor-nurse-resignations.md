## Article summary
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is facing significant workforce changes as part of a DOGE initiative aimed at reducing its staff by 15%, with over 11,000 employees applying for deferred resignations. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins insists that these cuts will not compromise veterans' healthcare, despite concerns raised by lawmakers regarding the potential impact on care quality. The VA employs approximately 470,000 individuals, including over 371,000 healthcare professionals, and operates numerous facilities across the country. Collins aims to enhance productivity and efficiency, but this has raised alarms among veterans and staff, with a recent poll indicating that 81% of veterans fear cuts could affect their benefits and healthcare. Critics, including Senator Bernie Sanders, highlight the existing shortage of healthcare providers within the VA, questioning the feasibility of maintaining care levels amidst workforce reductions. Collins acknowledges challenges in recruiting healthcare professionals but maintains that the goal is to improve services rather than cut them. VA officials have stated that approvals for deferred resignations in healthcare roles will be tightly controlled. The deadline for employees to apply for deferred resignations has been extended to May 16, with separations planned for September 30. Concerns continue to mount regarding job security and its effects on patient care, as veterans and employees alike express anxiety over the changes.
