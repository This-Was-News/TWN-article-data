## Article summary
The Trump administration has proposed a rule change that would significantly alter the interpretation of "harm" in the Endangered Species Act, potentially placing endangered species' habitats at risk. Under this new definition, actions that damage habitats would not be considered harmful unless they directly injure or kill the animals themselves. This shift could facilitate activities like logging, mining, and construction on lands essential for the survival of endangered species. Conservationists argue that habitat loss is the leading cause of extinction, and this change would undermine decades of protection for over 1,700 species. Historically, "harm" has been interpreted broadly to include actions that degrade habitats, crucial for species' feeding, breeding, and shelter. The proposed change cites a dissenting opinion from Justice Antonin Scalia, advocating for a narrower interpretation of "take." Critics, including conservation experts, assert that this approach is illogical as it ignores indirect harm to populations. The public has a 30-day window to comment on the proposal, which is also expected to face legal challenges. Overall, the proposed rule could reverse conservation gains and lead to further losses in biodiversity.
