## Article summary
Israel has launched significant airstrikes in Gaza, marking the first major military action since a ceasefire began two months ago. The strikes, which have resulted in over 400 Palestinian deaths according to Gazan health officials, come after failed negotiations with Hamas regarding an extension of the truce and the release of hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel will intensify its military efforts against Hamas, citing their refusal to compromise. The situation has raised concerns about the fate of hostages still held by Hamas, with fewer than half of the remaining 59 believed to be alive. 

The Israeli military has warned residents in certain areas of Gaza to evacuate, labeling them as combat zones. Meanwhile, Hamas has criticized Israel for overturning the ceasefire agreement and jeopardizing the lives of the hostages. The renewed conflict has sparked a mix of reactions in Israel, with some celebrating the military action while others fear for the hostages' safety. The strikes have also led to accusations from a hostages' advocacy group, which claims the Israeli government has abandoned those still in captivity. 

As of now, Hamas has not retaliated militarily, leaving uncertainty about the next steps in the conflict. The situation remains fluid, with the potential for further escalation as both sides navigate the complexities of their stalled negotiations.
