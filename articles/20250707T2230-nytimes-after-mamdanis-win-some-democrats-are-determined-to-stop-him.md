## Article summary
The New York City mayoral race has intensified following Zohran Mamdani's primary victory, prompting some Democrats to strategize on how to defeat him. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, both running as independents, have called for each other to withdraw from the race. Independent candidate Jim Walden proposed a poll to determine which candidate has the best chance against Mamdani, urging those who do not win to support the victor. The Democratic establishment is alarmed by Mamdani's leftist platform, which includes proposals like freezing rents and universal childcare. Despite calls for unity, there are signs of discord among the independent candidates, with Adams and Cuomo unwilling to drop out. Mamdani's campaign has garnered significant support, with over 545,000 votes in the primary—the highest in 36 years. Some Democratic leaders express a desire to rally behind Mamdani, while others remain opposed and uncertain about the future of their candidacies. Unions that previously backed Cuomo have shifted their support to Mamdani, complicating his opponents' chances. As the election approaches, the dynamics among candidates continue to evolve, reflecting the contentious political climate.
