## Article summary
The article discusses the plight of homeless veterans in Los Angeles, focusing on Iraq war veteran Irving Webb, who has lived outside the VA's West LA campus for five years. Despite the campus's size, it has struggled to provide adequate housing for the city's highest population of homeless veterans. Recent political pressure has led to the establishment of temporary shelters, but many veterans still find themselves without options, particularly those with severe disabilities. An executive order from the Trump administration aims to create the National Center for Warrior Independence on the VA campus, intending to house 6,000 veterans by 2028. However, this plan raises concerns, as it may involve relocating veterans from across the country, and lacks specific funding details. Critics, including Congressman Brad Sherman, question the seriousness of the order, suggesting it may be more of a political move than a concrete solution. Advocates like Rob Reynolds express hope that the order could finally lead to the construction of necessary housing. While some legal challenges remain regarding housing development on the campus, there is a collective desire among advocates for a comprehensive plan that includes long-term housing and supportive services for veterans.
