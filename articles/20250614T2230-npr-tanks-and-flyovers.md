## Article summary
The U.S. Army celebrated its 250th anniversary with a large military parade in Washington, D.C., coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday. The event, which featured thousands of service members and military equipment, has sparked controversy over its perceived politicization of the armed forces during peacetime. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the parade as a self-indulgent display of power, likening it to demonstrations seen in autocratic regimes. Protests against the parade were organized nationwide by the group No Kings, which described it as a "costly, wasteful, and un-American" spectacle. Despite the planned festivities, concerns arose over potential damage to city infrastructure and significant street closures. The parade, which includes historical military displays and a fireworks finale, is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million. Trump has long desired such a parade, having first expressed interest after witnessing a military display in France. The last major military parade in the U.S. took place in 1991 following the Gulf War. While the Army emphasizes the event's historical significance, critics argue it reflects a shift in how the military is utilized in American politics.
