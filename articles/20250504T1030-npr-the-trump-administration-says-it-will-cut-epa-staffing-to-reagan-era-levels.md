## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced a major reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), aiming to reduce staffing to levels reminiscent of the Reagan era. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin indicated that the agency's workforce, currently around 15,000, could decrease significantly, potentially removing thousands of positions. Key changes will affect the Office of Research and Development, which conducts vital scientific research on environmental hazards and informs regulations like the Clean Air Act. The restructuring will involve moving some scientific staff into policy-making roles while others will be placed in newly established offices. 

Concerns have been raised by former officials and experts that these cuts could undermine the EPA's ability to protect public health and carry out essential research. The administration has proposed a budget cut of approximately 45% for the research office and overall budget reductions that could save $300 million by 2026. Staff members have expressed anxiety over the reorganization, likening it to a game of "musical chairs" with fewer positions available. This reorganization follows a series of cuts across federal scientific programs, including significant layoffs in other agencies. The changes reflect a broader trend of reducing scientific oversight and environmental protections under the current administration.
