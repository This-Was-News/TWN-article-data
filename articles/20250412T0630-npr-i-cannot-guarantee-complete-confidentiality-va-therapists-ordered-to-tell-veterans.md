## Article summary
Mental health therapists at the Veterans Affairs (VA) have been instructed to inform patients about the lack of complete confidentiality during sessions due to shared office spaces. This directive comes as the VA mandates a return to in-person work, which has created anxiety among clinicians about their ability to provide quality care. A memo obtained by NPR outlines a script for therapists to use, emphasizing that while they will strive to maintain privacy, it cannot be guaranteed. 

The VA is undergoing a significant restructuring, planning to cut about 80,000 jobs, prompting concerns about the impact on mental health care delivery. Many therapists, who were initially hired for telehealth roles, fear logistical issues such as inadequate space and privacy will hinder their ability to conduct effective therapy. Some clinicians have expressed that they may have to cancel sessions due to these new requirements, risking reprimands. 

The American Psychological Association has criticized the VA's policies, warning that they could violate federal privacy laws and compromise patient care. VA officials have insisted that privacy laws will continue to be upheld, but therapists remain skeptical about the feasibility of this assurance. Overall, there is a pervasive sense of distress among VA clinicians, who worry that these changes will adversely affect their mission to support veterans' mental health.
