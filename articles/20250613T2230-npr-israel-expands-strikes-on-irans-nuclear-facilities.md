## Article summary
Israel has intensified its military campaign against Iran, targeting key nuclear facilities, including the Natanz enrichment site. The Israeli military reported that strikes damaged the underground area housing centrifuges and supporting infrastructure at Natanz. Satellite imagery confirmed the destruction of buildings and electrical systems at the site, while additional strikes were reported at other facilities, including Fordow and Isfahan. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran acknowledged the damage but stated that there was no radioactive contamination. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi condemned the attacks, emphasizing that nuclear facilities should never be targeted. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Iran could quickly produce a nuclear weapon if its program is not halted. Experts noted that while the strikes disrupted operations, they did not destroy the underground centrifuges, which remain intact. Analysts express skepticism about the effectiveness of military force in permanently dismantling Iran's nuclear capabilities. Ultimately, the situation highlights the complexities of Iran's nuclear program and the challenges in preventing its potential development of nuclear weapons.
