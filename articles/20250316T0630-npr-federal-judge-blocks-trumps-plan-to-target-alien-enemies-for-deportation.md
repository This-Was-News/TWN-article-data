## Article summary
A federal judge has blocked President Trump's recent action to expedite the deportation of individuals identified as "alien enemies," specifically targeting members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a rarely used law that allows for the detention and deportation of nationals from enemy nations during wartime. This move aims to remove Venezuelan citizens aged 14 and older who are not U.S. citizens or lawful residents, labeling them as threats to national security. However, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order halting the deportations just hours after the action was announced, responding to a lawsuit from the ACLU.

The judge's order not only prevents immediate deportations but also mandates the return of planes already en route for these actions. Legal experts express concerns that the use of the Alien Enemies Act could lead to broader deportations beyond those associated with criminal activities. Historical precedent suggests that wartime powers have not been successfully applied to peacetime immigration enforcement, indicating potential challenges ahead for the Trump administration's efforts. Advocates for immigrant rights are actively opposing this move, fearing it could lead to widespread abuses of authority. The legal landscape surrounding this issue remains uncertain, as further hearings are scheduled to address the implications of the president's action.
