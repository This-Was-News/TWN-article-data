## Article summary
A low-income mother in Georgia, Annalnda Martnez, has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the state to stop child support fees after her children were placed in foster care. Between 2018 and 2022, Georgia removed children from 700 families due to inadequate housing, often leaving them homeless or without stable housing. The lawsuit argues that state agencies knew these families were impoverished but charged them foster care fees anyway. Georgia's system is described as one of the most punitive, with advocates criticizing child welfare agencies for removing children from low-income families due to financial struggles. The federal government advised limiting child support requests in 2022, and states like California and Michigan reduced the practice, but Georgia's new rules do not apply to older cases like Martnez's. The lawsuit seeks to stop child support fees for children who have aged out of the system or been adopted, claiming these fees violate state law. Martnez, who became homeless and worked three jobs, was ordered to pay $472 per month despite living below the poverty line. She eventually gave up parental rights to her six daughters, causing irreparable trauma. The lawsuit also seeks compensation for child support payments that did not account for her circumstances. Martnez still faces threats of jail time for unpaid child support, despite her current financial struggles. The lawsuit targets the Division of Family and Children Services, which denies the allegations. Martnez's story highlights the broader issue of punitive child support practices against low-income families.
