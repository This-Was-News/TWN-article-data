## Article summary
President Donald Trump has overhauled the White House Rose Garden, replacing the grass with a stone patio inspired by his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The $1.9 million project, funded by private donations, includes diagonal paving stones, new drainage systems, and presidential seals at the corners. Trump justified the change by noting that the grass became too soggy, especially for women wearing high heels. The Rose Garden, originally designed during the Kennedy administration, has undergone several transformations over the years. It has served as a backdrop for press conferences and signing ceremonies, and even hosted an 11-year-old boy mowing the lawn. Despite criticism, the garden remains a vibrant space with flowers and new plantings. The latest renovation includes patio tables with striped umbrellas, and a new speaker system allowing Trump to play music from the White House. While some changes may be controversial, historians note that the White House evolves over time with different presidents and first ladies adding their own touches.
