## Article summary
European postal services have suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. due to the expiration of an exemption on tariff duties for low-value packages. The de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for packages under $800, expired on Friday. Postal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, France, and Austria have halted shipments, with the U.K. following on Tuesday. The U.S. and EU agreed on a 15% tariff for most products shipped from the EU, including packages under $800. European postal services are pausing deliveries due to ambiguity about the new rules and lack of time to process their implications. DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, will no longer accept packages destined for the U.S. from business customers. The U.S. duty-free exemption for goods originating from China ended in May. Postal services are uncertain about how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future. PostEurop, an association of European postal operators, warns that if no solution is found by August 29, all its members will likely follow suit.
