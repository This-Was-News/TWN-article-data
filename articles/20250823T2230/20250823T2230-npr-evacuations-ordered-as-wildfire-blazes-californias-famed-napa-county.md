## Article summary
Evacuation orders are in effect as wildfires rage across the western United States, including in California's scenic Napa County. The Pckett Fire, which has burned nearly 4,690 acres, first sparked on Thursday afternoon and continued to spread with only 7% containment as of Saturday. The cause of the fire is unknown, but it is burning in the same area as the devastating 2020 Glass Fire. Cal Fire operations section chief Jeremy Perce assured residents that the two fires are different, with the Pckett Fire being driven by slope and fuels rather than extreme weather. Over 1,200 personnel, 80 fire engines, and seven helicopters are working to contain the blaze. Meanwhile, in Oregon, the Flat Fire has scorched at least 3,300 acres, driven by persistent heat and dry conditions. Some areas, including near the Lake Billy Chinook reservoir, have been upgraded to level 3, or 'go now,' evacuation status. Residents were warned to leave immediately, as emergency services may not be available to assist them. The cause of the Flat Fire is still under investigation.
