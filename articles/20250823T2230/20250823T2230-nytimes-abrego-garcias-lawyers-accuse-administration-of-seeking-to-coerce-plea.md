## Article summary
Lawyers for Klmar Armando Abrego Garca accuse the Trump administration of attempting to coerce a guilty plea by threatening deportation to Uganda. The lawyers allege that prosecutors initially offered a deal to deport Abrego Garca to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty to criminal charges. After he was released from custody, the administration threatened to deport him to Uganda if he did not accept the plea deal. The lawyers claim this is an attempt to force Abrego Garca to choose between a guilty plea and deportation to a dangerous country. The Justice Department spokesman defended the charges, calling Abrego Garca a danger to the community. The lawyers previously filed a motion accusing the administration of vindictively filing an indictment against Abrego Garca. The latest filing asks the judge to dismiss the case. The administration's actions suggest an effort to rid themselves of a legal and political problem. Abrego Garca's lawyers argue that the administration's actions highlight its vindictiveness. The case's future remains uncertain, with potential challenges if deportation to Uganda is pursued.
