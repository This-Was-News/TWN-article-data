## Article summary
The University of Colorado-Colorado Springs (UCCS) initially believed it could avoid scrutiny from the Trump administration's crackdown on higher education due to its conservative-leaning, politically subdued environment. However, the school soon found itself under investigation, losing federal grants and facing pressure to navigate unprecedented changes. UCCS, like elite universities, confronted challenges such as grant cuts, investigations into diversity programs, and shifting federal guidelines. The school took preemptive actions, renaming websites and job titles to avoid scrutiny, while faculty and students felt the stress of these changes. The Trump administration's aggressive approach to higher education, including investigations into antisemitism and cuts to research funding, impacted UCCS despite its initial optimism. The school's administrators struggled to keep up with the rapid changes and sought to avoid controversy, even as some students and faculty pushed for a more vocal stance on issues like climate change and immigration.
