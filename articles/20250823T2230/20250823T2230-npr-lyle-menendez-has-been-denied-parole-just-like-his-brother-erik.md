## Article summary
Lyle Menendez has been denied parole, following his brother Erik's similar denial. A two-person panel found Lyle unsuitable for release, citing ongoing risks to the public despite his model behavior in prison. The brothers have been incarcerated for over three decades for the 1989 murders of their parents. Lyle's next parole hearing is set for three years later. The parole commission noted Lyle's struggles with deception and rule-following, despite his remorse and positive factors. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office opposed parole, arguing the brothers remain a threat. Lyle's attorney highlighted the role of alleged childhood sexual abuse in the crimes. During the hearing, Lyle discussed the abuse and his mental state during the murders, claiming no premeditation. He also addressed his conduct in prison, including cellphone violations. Family members pleaded for his release, citing his rehabilitation. The decision is subject to further review, and Governor Gavin Newsom can intervene. The brothers also seek clemency from the governor.
