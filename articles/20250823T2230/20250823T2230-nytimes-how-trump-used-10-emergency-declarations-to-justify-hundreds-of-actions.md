## Article summary
In his seven months back in office, President Trump has declared nine national emergencies, plus a crime emergency in Washington, D.C., using these declarations to justify hundreds of actions, including immigration measures, sweeping tariffs, and energy deregulation that typically require congressional approval or lengthy regulatory review. These emergencies have been used to militarize the southern border, designate cartels as terrorists, expedite mining and energy production on federal lands, impose tariffs on various countries, and sanction the International Criminal Court. Trump's use of emergency powers has far outpaced previous presidents, with experts questioning the legitimacy of some declarations. His actions include deploying the military for immigration enforcement, imposing tariffs on trading partners, and declaring a national energy emergency to bypass environmental regulations. Additionally, Trump has used emergency declarations to justify actions against Brazil, the International Criminal Court, and to federalize the Washington police force. Despite congressional and legal challenges, many of these actions remain in effect.
