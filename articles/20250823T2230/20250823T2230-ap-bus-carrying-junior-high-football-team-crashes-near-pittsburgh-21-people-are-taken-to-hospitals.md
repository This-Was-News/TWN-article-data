A bus carrying a junior high football team to a game crashed near Pittsburgh, sending 21 of the 28 people on board to the hospital. The bus was transporting 25 students and three adults from Alquppa Junior High School to a game in nearby Gbsona. The crash occurred in Economy Borough, about 20 miles north of Pittsburgh. Police Chief Michael OBren reported that the bus turned on its side during the crash but righted itself as students were evacuating.

The Alquppa Junior High football team's Facebook page requested thoughts and prayers for the players and coaches involved in the crash.
