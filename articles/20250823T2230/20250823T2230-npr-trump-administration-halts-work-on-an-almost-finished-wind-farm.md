## Article summary
The Trump administration has ordered a halt to the construction of the Revolution Wind farm, an almost-finished offshore wind project near Rhode Island, citing national security concerns. This move is part of a broader trend by the Trump administration targeting the renewable energy industry, including a January moratorium on new offshore wind projects. The project, developed by Ørsted and Global Infrastructure Partners, is set to provide power to Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year. Industry experts warn that such disruptions could have significant economic and employment repercussions. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the stop-work order, while Ørsted is exploring legal options to resolve the issue. Analysts and industry groups criticize the administration's actions, stating that they undermine investor confidence and threaten to increase energy costs. The Interior Department previously halted work on another offshore wind project near Long Island, which resumed after a costly disruption. The Oceantic Network and other advocacy groups argue that these actions jeopardize American jobs and energy dominance.
