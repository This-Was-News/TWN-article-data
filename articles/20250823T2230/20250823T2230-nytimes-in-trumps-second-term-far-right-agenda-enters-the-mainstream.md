## Article summary
During President Trump's second term, far-right demonstrations have significantly decreased, with leaders like Enrique Tarro of the Proud Boys noting that their agenda has become mainstream. Trump has adopted various far-right views, including dismantling diversity programs and promoting authoritarian nationalism, which has delighted right-wing activists. His administration has hired individuals with histories of racist or antisemitic remarks and has aggressively cracked down on undocumented immigrants, aligning with far-right ideologies. Far-right figures celebrate the normalization of their once-fringe positions, such as those expressed during the 2017 Charlottesville rally. The Trump administration has also issued executive orders and policies that echo far-right rhetoric, including measures targeting immigrants and supporting white minorities in South Africa. Despite controversies, Trump and his allies often defend or ignore racist and far-right views within their ranks. The relative quiet among far-right groups is attributed to the administration enacting much of their agenda, reducing the need for public protests. Experts note the normalization of far-right ideas at the highest levels of power, reflecting a significant shift in political discourse.
