## Article summary
The article "Undocumented Workers, Fearing Deportation, Are Staying Home" discusses how fears of deportation under President Trump's administration are causing many undocumented immigrants to avoid work, leading to significant labor shortages in various industries such as construction, agriculture, senior care, and hospitality. The absence of these workers is already impacting businesses, resulting in increased costs and potential service disruptions. Many immigrants, who have historically filled low-wage jobs that native-born Americans often avoid, are now hesitant to seek employment due to heightened immigration enforcement and the threat of mass deportations. 

The agricultural sector, which relies heavily on immigrant labor, is facing acute shortages, as evidenced by a recent crackdown that resulted in a significant drop in worker attendance. The senior care industry is similarly affected, with a growing demand for workers that cannot be met by the native workforce alone. The article highlights the interconnectedness of immigrant labor and the economy, indicating that the removal of these workers could lead to higher consumer prices and service shortages. 

Experts warn that if the situation persists, it could lead to a "systems collapse" in industries that depend on immigrant workers. Additionally, the emotional toll on mixed-status families is severe, with many experiencing anxiety and uncertainty as enforcement actions intensify. Overall, the piece underscores the critical role that undocumented workers play in the U.S. economy and the far-reaching consequences of their potential removal.
