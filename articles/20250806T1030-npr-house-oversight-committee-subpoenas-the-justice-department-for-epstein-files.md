## Article summary
The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed the Department of Justice for records related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell. The subpoena, one of 11 issued, demands all documents and communications related to the case by August 19. Committee Chairman James Comer emphasized the importance of congressional oversight in the handling of the Epstein and Maxwell cases. The DOJ declined to comment, and additional subpoenas were issued seeking testimony from former government officials, including former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The subpoena risks a potential clash between Congress and the White House, as President Trump has been lobbying for the release of grand jury testimony connected to Epstein and Maxwell.
