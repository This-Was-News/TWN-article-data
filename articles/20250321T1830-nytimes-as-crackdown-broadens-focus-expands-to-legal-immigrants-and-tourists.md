## Article summary
The Trump administration's immigration agenda has expanded to include legal immigrants and tourists, employing aggressive tactics at U.S. ports of entry. Recent actions have involved detaining individuals based on their expressed opposition to government policies, raising concerns among foreign tourists and immigrant communities. The administration argues these measures are necessary for national security, while critics suggest they infringe on free speech rights. Notable cases include the detention of a Georgetown University academic and two German tourists, as well as the deportation of a Brown University professor despite her valid visa. The administration is utilizing a rarely invoked provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to expel individuals deemed threats to U.S. foreign policy. Critics, including former officials, assert that the administration is targeting individuals for their speech rather than any legal violations. Free-speech advocates emphasize that the actions taken against these individuals may violate First Amendment protections. The crackdown has prompted American allies to update travel advisories, reflecting international concern over the U.S. immigration policies. As the administration continues its hardline stance, the implications for legal immigrants and the broader discourse on free expression remain significant.
