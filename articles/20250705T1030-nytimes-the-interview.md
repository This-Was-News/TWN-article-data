## Article summary
Mark Rutte, NATO's Secretary General, discusses the significant impact President Trump has had on the alliance, particularly in increasing defense spending commitments among member nations. Despite Trump's skepticism towards NATO and past threats to withdraw, Rutte argues that Trump's leadership has been crucial in securing agreements for NATO to raise its defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. Rutte emphasizes the interconnectedness of security in the Arctic, Atlantic, and Europe, asserting that U.S. security is tied to European stability. He acknowledges the need for Europe to take on more responsibility for its defense while maintaining confidence in U.S. commitment to NATO. Rutte addresses criticisms of his relationship with Trump, asserting that praise for Trump is warranted given the outcomes achieved under his leadership. He downplays concerns about an arms race with Russia and stresses the importance of deterrence. Rutte also highlights the need for a robust defense industrial base in Europe to meet military needs. He concludes that NATO remains strong and united, despite internal debates on democratic values among member states. Overall, Rutte expresses optimism about NATO's future with the U.S. at its core.
