## Article summary
The "No Kings" protests took place across the U.S. and internationally on June 14, 2025, coinciding with a military parade organized by the Trump administration to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary and Trump's 79th birthday. Tens of thousands participated in peaceful demonstrations in cities like Philadelphia, New York, and Dallas, while events were also held in Germany and France. Organizers, including MoveOn and Indivisible, emphasized the connection between Philadelphia and the nation's founding ideals, highlighting the peaceful expression of First Amendment rights. However, protests in Minnesota were canceled due to concerns over recent political violence, including a tragic shooting targeting elected officials.

Protesters criticized the parade as a display of dominance and an assertion of Trump's authority, with some expressing fears of authoritarianism. Trump dismissed the protests, claiming he does not feel like a king. The protests were organized by over 200 groups and aimed to contrast their grassroots movement with what they viewed as a costly and extravagant celebration. The military parade's estimated cost ranged from $25 million to $45 million and included a large military presence. Organizers urged participants to remain nonviolent and de-escalate potential conflicts during the events.
