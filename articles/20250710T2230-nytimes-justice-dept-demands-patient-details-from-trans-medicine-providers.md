## Article summary
The Justice Department has issued subpoenas to over 20 doctors and hospitals providing gender-related treatments to minors, aiming to gather confidential patient information and investigate potential fraud. This action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to limit transgender medical care, with critics arguing it is politically motivated and intimidating. The subpoenas follow a Supreme Court decision upholding state bans on youth gender medicine, increasing pressure on hospitals and doctors in states without such restrictions. Several hospitals, including those in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, have shut down their youth gender clinics due to mounting pressure and threats of funding cuts. Opponents of gender-related treatments have accused specific providers of misleading patients and insurers, while supporters argue the treatments can be beneficial for transgender adolescents.
