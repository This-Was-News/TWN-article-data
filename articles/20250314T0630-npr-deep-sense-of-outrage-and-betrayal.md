## Article summary
House Democrats expressed a profound sense of outrage and betrayal following Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's announcement that he would support a GOP spending bill, which many in the party oppose. During their annual retreat in Virginia, representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized Schumer's decision, viewing it as a significant affront to party unity. They had hoped that Senate Democrats would align with the House's rejection of the bill, which was seen as a moment of solidarity. 

Rep. Pramila Jayapal warned that acquiescing to the GOP could set a dangerous precedent for future negotiations. Schumer defended his choice by arguing that a government shutdown would be worse than passing the partisan bill. However, dissenting voices within the House, including Rep. Joe Morelle, suggested that Schumer's support would embolden Republicans to further dismantle government structures. 

Ocasio-Cortez countered Schumer's rationale, asserting that supporting the bill would legitimize detrimental cuts. She and her colleagues are actively urging senators to reconsider their positions before a crucial vote. House Democratic leaders, including Hakeem Jeffries, reiterated their opposition to the GOP bill and expressed readiness to negotiate a temporary resolution to keep the government functioning.
