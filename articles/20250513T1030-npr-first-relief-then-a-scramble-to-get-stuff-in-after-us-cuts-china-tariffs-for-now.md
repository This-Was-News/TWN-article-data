## Article summary
The recent temporary cut in tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. has sparked a sense of relief among business owners, but it has also led to a frantic effort to ship products before the 90-day period ends. Bonnie Ross, a clothing importer, quickly shifted her focus to maximizing shipments while worrying about potential freight rate increases due to high demand. The tariff reduction from 145% to 30% on Chinese imports is welcomed, but it prolongs uncertainty for many businesses. Jay Foreman, who produces toys in China, is now scheduling shipments but acknowledges that the lower tax will still lead to some price increases for consumers. Jonathan Silva, a board game producer, has also resumed shipping after holding back due to previous tariffs and is eager to replenish stock before the holiday season. Despite the temporary relief, he considers exploring manufacturing alternatives outside China. Business owners express a mix of optimism and anxiety about the future, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of the current trade landscape. Overall, while the tariff cuts provide immediate relief, they also create a rush to adapt before the situation potentially changes again.
