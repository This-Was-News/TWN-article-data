## Article summary
In Canada's northern outposts, remnants of Cold War-era radar systems like the Pinetree Line and the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line stand as rusting relics. These systems, including the one in Chibougamau, Quebec, were crucial for detecting Soviet bombers during the Cold War. Today, these sites are largely abandoned, with some repurposed, like the Chibougamau base turned into a golf course. The article highlights personal stories from those who lived and worked at these remote stations, reflecting on their significance and the changes they brought to local communities. As geopolitical tensions rise again in the Arctic, Canada faces decisions about modernizing its defenses, with discussions ongoing about joining a U.S.-led $175 billion defense shield project.
