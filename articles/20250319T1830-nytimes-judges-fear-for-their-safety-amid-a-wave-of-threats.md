## Article summary
Judges are increasingly concerned for their safety due to a surge of threats and intimidation, particularly against those overseeing significant cases involving the Trump administration. Recent incidents include online threats and real-life intimidation, such as bomb threats and swatting attacks. A notable incident involved a hoax bomb threat directed at the sister of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Judge Esther Salas, whose son was tragically killed in a targeted attack, emphasized the serious risks judges face, urging leaders to recognize the gravity of the situation. 

The threats have intensified following President Trump's public calls for the impeachment of judges who rule against his administration, leading to hostile reactions from his supporters on social media. Judges from both parties have faced threats, but many incidents appear linked to high-profile cases against Trump policies. The U.S. Marshals Service has noted a troubling trend of intimidation tactics, including unsolicited pizza deliveries to judges' homes, which serve as a warning of their personal safety. 

While some judges argue that threats have always existed, they express concern over the current political climate that seems to endorse hostility toward the judiciary. Chief Justice John Roberts has warned of a significant increase in threats against judges, highlighting the potential erosion of respect for the judicial system. The overall sentiment among judges is one of heightened fear, with calls for greater protection and acknowledgment of the threats they face in fulfilling their duties.
