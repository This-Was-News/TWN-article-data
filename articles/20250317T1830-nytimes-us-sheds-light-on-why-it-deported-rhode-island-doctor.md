## Article summary
Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a professor and doctor at Brown University, was deported by the Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.) after she admitted to attending a Hezbollah leader's funeral in Lebanon. Upon her return to the U.S., she was detained at Boston Logan International Airport, where she expressed support for Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. D.H.S. stated that such support constitutes grounds for visa denial, emphasizing that a visa is a privilege rather than a right. The department did not disclose how they learned of her attendance at the funeral, which attracted a large crowd. 

Dr. Alawieh, who holds a valid H1-B visa, was in Lebanon visiting family when she was detained. A federal judge had ordered the government to notify the court 48 hours prior to any deportation, but Dr. Alawieh's flight had already left before the order was acknowledged. Lawyers initially representing her family withdrew from the case, citing the need for further diligence. 

Dr. Alawieh, a transplant nephrologist, is considered a valuable asset in her medical field, which is facing a shortage of doctors. The Brown University administration has advised foreign students to reconsider travel plans amid the situation.
