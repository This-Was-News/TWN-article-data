## Article summary
U.S. stock markets experienced another decline, erasing earlier gains, as concerns over President Trump's tariffs intensified. The sell-off has resulted in significant losses, with trillions of dollars in investor wealth wiped out since last week. Despite a brief rebound earlier in the session, stocks fell sharply after the White House confirmed the implementation of a 104% tariff on China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 300 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also posted losses.

While global markets in Asia and Europe saw some gains, U.S. investors remain wary due to the potential impact of tariffs on exports. The price of gold surged to over $3,000 an ounce, reflecting the current economic uncertainty reminiscent of the late 1970s and 1980s. In response to the tariffs, Chinese companies have begun share buybacks to stabilize their markets, while officials have vowed not to back down against U.S. threats. Other countries, such as South Korea, are reportedly seeking to negotiate with the U.S. amid the ongoing trade tensions.
