## Article summary
A federal judge has permanently struck down an executive order issued by President Trump that targeted the law firm Perkins Coie, marking the first such ruling against Trump's punitive measures aimed at law firms he dislikes. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell declared the order unconstitutional, emphasizing that it undermines the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The executive order had suspended security clearances for Perkins Coie employees, barred access to government buildings, and terminated government contracts with the firm. Howell criticized the order as a historical precedent, likening it to a Shakespearean tactic of attacking lawyers. The judge noted that the action penalized the firm for representing clients and causes contrary to Trump's interests. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, which they believe upholds constitutional freedoms such as free speech and due process. The decision is significant as it addresses broader implications for legal representation amidst political tensions. While Perkins Coie and three other firms have successfully challenged Trump's orders, many others have reportedly negotiated to avoid similar punitive actions. The ruling reinforces the importance of protecting the rule of law against retaliatory measures from the executive branch.
