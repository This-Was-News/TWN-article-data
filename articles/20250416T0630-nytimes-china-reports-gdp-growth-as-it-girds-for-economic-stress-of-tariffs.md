## Article summary
China's economy initially benefited from President Trump's tariffs, with a reported GDP growth of 1.2% in early 2024, leading to an annual growth projection of 4.9%. However, the escalating tariffs, reaching up to 145% on many exports to the U.S., pose significant challenges moving forward. While exports surged in March, the long-term effects of increased tariffs are expected to dampen trade and potentially raise unemployment. Chinese officials aim to boost domestic consumer spending to reduce reliance on foreign markets, implementing subsidies for various products. Despite a 5.4% year-on-year economic output increase in Q1, concerns about consumer spending persist, particularly following a substantial decline in the housing market. Many families are now more frugal, impacting demand for everyday goods. Construction activity has stalled due to decreased demand for new apartments, further straining the economy. Economists anticipate additional policies to counteract the negative impacts of the tariff war. The central bank's gradual currency devaluation may not sufficiently offset the tariff-induced cost increases. Overall, the combination of tariffs and domestic market challenges presents a complex landscape for China's economic future.
