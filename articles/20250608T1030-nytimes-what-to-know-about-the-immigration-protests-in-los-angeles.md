## Article summary
The immigration protests in Los Angeles have escalated following President Trump's order to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to the area in response to demonstrations against raids targeting undocumented immigrants. The protests, which began on Friday and continued into Saturday, were sparked by a new phase of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, resulting in the arrest of 121 immigrants in Los Angeles. While some protests were peaceful, others turned confrontational, with demonstrators clashing with police who responded with rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. 

California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized Trump's decision as inflammatory, asserting it would heighten tensions, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stated that the city could manage the protests without the National Guard's involvement. Trump administration officials labeled the protests as insurrection, further fueling the political divide. Despite the heightened presence of law enforcement, local authorities did not request federal assistance. The National Guard's last deployment in response to civil unrest occurred during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Organizers have called for more demonstrations, indicating that the situation remains fluid.
