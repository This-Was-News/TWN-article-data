## Article summary
A federal judge, James Boasberg, criticized the Trump administration's response to his previous orders regarding the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, labeling it "woefully insufficient." He had requested more detailed information about the flights, which occurred despite his directive to turn the planes around. The administration provided only a brief declaration from a regional ICE official, failing to address the judge's inquiries adequately. Boasberg noted that the government mentioned the possibility of invoking the state-secrets privilege but did not offer substantial evidence or reasoning for this claim. He emphasized that a regional official's testimony was inadequate for discussing Cabinet-level decisions. The judge reset deadlines for the government to clarify its stance on the state-secrets privilege and to provide further explanations. In response to the judge's actions, a Department of Justice spokesperson described the court's inquiries as inappropriate judicial overreach. Trump previously called for Boasberg's impeachment, criticizing him publicly. The ongoing legal battle highlights tensions between the judiciary and the executive branch regarding immigration enforcement and national security.
