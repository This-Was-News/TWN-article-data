## Article summary
The article discusses the dangers of taking selfies, particularly in India, where a significant number of selfie-related deaths have been reported. In 2017, a study found that India accounted for more than half of the 127 selfie deaths worldwide from 2014 to 2016. In response, Indian authorities launched awareness campaigns and developed apps to warn people about high-risk areas. Despite these efforts, India remains at the top of the global list for dangerous selfies, with recent surveys indicating a high number of incidents. Common danger zones include heights, waterfalls, and bridges, with men being the primary instigators. The pursuit of online validation and the desire for internet fame often lead to risky behavior. Hashtags promoting dangerous selfies encourage copycat actions. Authorities are also concerned about selfies taken during massive gatherings, which can lead to accidents and stampedes. To prevent tragedies, police make announcements and temporarily confiscate phones from offenders.
