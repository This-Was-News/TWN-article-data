## Article summary
A flotilla of ships departed from Barcelona on Sunday, carrying humanitarian aid and activists, in the largest attempt yet to break Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip. The convoy, consisting of about 20 boats and delegations from 44 countries, aims to deliver food, water, and medicine to Gaza, where Israel has intensified its offensive, limiting the delivery of essential supplies. The Gaza Health Ministry reports that the nearly 23-month war has killed over 63,000 people, with at least 332 Palestinians dying of malnutrition, including 124 children. The flotilla, expected to reach Gaza around September 14 or 15, includes notable figures like Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has previously been deported by Israel for attempting to reach Gaza. Israel has been accused of continuously violating international law by attacking and intercepting aid boats in international waters. This is the fourth attempt this year to break the maritime blockade, following previous attempts by the Conscience and the Handala, which were either attacked or seized by the Israeli military. The flotilla's departure was marked by thousands of supporters in Barcelona, chanting slogans and waving Palestinian flags. Meanwhile, Israel has announced plans to halt or slow humanitarian aid into parts of northern Gaza as it expands its military offensive against Hamas, following the declaration of Gaza City as a combat zone.
