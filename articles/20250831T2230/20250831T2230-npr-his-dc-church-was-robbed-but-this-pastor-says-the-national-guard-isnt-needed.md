## Article summary
Rev. Kp Banks, pastor of the East Washington Heights Baptist Church in D.C.'s Ward 7, discusses the impact of the National Guard deployment following President Trump's declaration of a crime emergency. While crime rates had been decreasing before the deployment, Banks expresses concern about the military presence, stating that it does not make his congregation feel safer. Instead, it has disrupted daily life and increased fear among his parishioners, particularly regarding interactions with law enforcement and potential targeting of young Black men. Banks contrasts policing with military occupation, advocating for a neighborhood-based approach focused on understanding and compassion. He shares that pastors across the country, including those in Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles, share his concerns about using military force for policing. Banks emphasizes the need for love and peace, aligning with the teachings of Jesus Christ, rather than the way of war.
