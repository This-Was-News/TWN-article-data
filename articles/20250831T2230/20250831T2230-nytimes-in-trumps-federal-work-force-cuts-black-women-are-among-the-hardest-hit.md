## Article summary
President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce have disproportionately affected Black employees, particularly Black women. Dr. Peggy Carr, the first Black woman to serve as the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, was dismissed after a 36-year career. Despite her long tenure and bipartisan respect, she was let go as part of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. Her dismissal was sudden and emotional, leaving her colleagues in tears. Black women make up 12% of the federal workforce, nearly double their overall share in the labor force. Experts note that the cuts have a disproportionate impact on Black employees, highlighting systemic disparities in the federal workforce.
