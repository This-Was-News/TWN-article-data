## Article summary
A federal judge temporarily blocked the deportation of Guatemalan children who arrived at the U.S. border without parents or guardians, ordering them to stay for at least two weeks while the legal battle unfolds. The drama unfolded over a holiday weekend, with children being prepared for flights to Guatemala, which advocates argued was a violation of their constitutional protections. The judge, Sparkle L. Sooknanan, expressed concern over the government's actions, stating that the situation should shock the conscience of all Americans. The children, some of whom have been living in U.S. shelters, fear for their safety if returned to Guatemala. The Trump administration claims the deportations were requested by the Guatemalan government, but lawyers for the children dispute this. The case highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's immigration policies and legal safeguards for vulnerable migrants. Similar legal actions are being pursued in other courts, including one involving a 12-year-old asylum-seeker with a chronic kidney disease. Families in Guatemala awaited the arrival of the deported children, with some relatives traveling through the night to be at the airport. The situation mirrors a previous showdown over the deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador. The judge's intervention came after she was alerted to the potential deportations in the early hours of the morning.
