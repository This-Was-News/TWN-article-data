## Article summary
Jan. 6 rioters, already pardoned by Trump, are now seeking compensation for what they claim were unfair prosecutions. One of their lawyers, Mark McCloskey, proposed creating a special panel to decide on financial damages. This panel would evaluate each rioter's case individually and assign sums based on alleged harm suffered from the federal government. McCloskey suggested that Jeanne Prro, who led the prosecution of nearly 1,600 rioters, oversee the panel. The rioters and their lawyers have been pushing the Trump administration to pay restitution. McCloskey described the panel as a voluntary, nonjudicial resolution committee, similar to the special master arrangement for Sept. 11 victims. He emphasized turning the rioters' losses into monetary claims. This effort follows Trump's pardon of the rioters and the subsequent purge of federal agents and prosecutors involved in their cases.
