## Article summary
Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, was injured in a car crash in New Hampshire while being driven by his spokesperson, Ted Goodman. The crash involved a rented Ford Bronco and a Honda HR-V driven by a 19-year-old woman. Giuliani suffered a fractured vertebra, lacerations, contusions, and other injuries but is reportedly recovering well. The crash was witnessed by state troopers and is being investigated, with no charges filed so far. Prior to the accident, Giuliani had assisted a domestic violence victim by contacting police. The crash occurred shortly after he continued his journey. Giuliani's son expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support. The incident follows a tumultuous period for Giuliani, who was once a prominent figure in Republican politics and a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump's election fraud claims, which were largely dismissed by courts and audits. Giuliani faced legal troubles, including a defamation lawsuit and contempt of court, ultimately reaching a settlement to avoid losing his assets.
