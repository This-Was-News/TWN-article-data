## Article summary
PBS and NPR stations are grappling with significant funding cuts due to the elimination of $1.1 billion in federal funding allocated to public broadcasting. Stations like KSPS in Spokane, Washington, face unique challenges, including losing Canadian contributors upset with President Donald Trump's policies. Many stations have launched emergency fundraising drives, with some exceeding expectations, like WHQR in Wilmington, North Carolina, which raised over $200,000 in three days. Hawaii Public Radio has also raised substantial funds to cover its budget shortfall. Despite these efforts, job and programming cuts are already occurring, with some stations reducing staff and suspending shows. PBS and NPR are reducing dues payments and seeking philanthropic support to help the hardest-hit stations. The crisis has forced stations to collaborate more closely, sharing resources and strategies to mitigate the impact of the funding cuts. While the immediate response has been positive, the long-term sustainability of some stations remains uncertain.
