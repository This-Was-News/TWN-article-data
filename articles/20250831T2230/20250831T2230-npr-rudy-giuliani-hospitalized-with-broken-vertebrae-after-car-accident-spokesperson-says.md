## Article summary
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with a broken vertebra after a high-speed car accident in New Hampshire. The 81-year-old was injured when his car was struck from behind, resulting in multiple injuries, including fractures and lacerations. Despite his injuries, Giuliani is reportedly in good spirits and recovering. His spokesperson clarified that the incident was not a targeted attack and urged the public to refrain from spreading conspiracy theories. Before the accident, Giuliani had assisted a woman involved in a domestic violence incident. Giuliani, known as 'America's mayor' after the 9/11 attacks, has been a prominent figure in Republican politics and a key member of President Trump's legal team challenging the 2020 election results. He has faced significant legal troubles, including indictments in Georgia and Arizona related to election interference and a defamation lawsuit involving former Georgia election workers. Giuliani was also found in contempt of court for failing to comply with a judgment in the defamation case.
