## Article summary
Utah-based violinist Donggn Shin, who goes by John, was arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Colorado on August 18. Shin's wife, DaNae Shin, set up a GoFundMe page to help cover his legal fees. Members of the music community are rallying in support of Shin, staging ongoing performances and expressing their anger and concern on social media. Shin, a longtime member of the Salt Lake City music community, has played with the Utah Symphony and Ballet West. He was arrested at a hotel parking lot while traveling in Colorado and is being held at the Denver Contract Detention Facility. The Department of Homeland Security cited Shin's overstayed visa and a 2019 DUI conviction as reasons for his arrest. Shin's attorney, Adam Crayk, stated that Shin came to the U.S. from South Korea as a child and later became a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. However, his DUI conviction, considered a significant misdemeanor, led to the revocation of his DACA status. The case highlights the surge in immigration-related arrests under President Trump's administration. Shin's case is scheduled for a hearing on September 2.
