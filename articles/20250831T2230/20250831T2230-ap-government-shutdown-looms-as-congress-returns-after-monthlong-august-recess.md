## Article summary
As Congress reconvenes after its August recess, the looming threat of a government shutdown on September 30 dominates the agenda. Republicans and Democrats must navigate contentious spending negotiations, with Republicans needing Democratic votes to pass a short-term funding measure. Complications arise from the Trump administration's efforts to rescind previously approved spending, including foreign aid funds. Senate Republicans are also considering changing chamber rules to bypass Democratic delays on nominations, a move that has angered President Trump. Meanwhile, Senator Lindsey Graham pushes for bipartisan sanctions legislation targeting Russia's trade partners, though Trump has yet to endorse it. In the House, Republicans continue investigations into former President Joe Biden's mental state while navigating internal divisions over the release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Additionally, Congress is discussing proposals to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks, a move gaining momentum but facing resistance from wealthy members.
