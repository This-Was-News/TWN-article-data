## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced plans to effectively eliminate the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) by reducing its staff to approximately 15 positions, down from around 10,000. This drastic cut is part of a strategy to integrate USAID under the State Department and reshape foreign aid to align with U.S. diplomatic priorities. An email titled "USAID's Final Mission" informed employees of impending layoffs, prompting protests from lawmakers and legal challenges from staff and unions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio endorsed the cuts, claiming previous USAID operations were misguided and fiscally irresponsible, although he assured that essential lifesaving programs would be maintained.

The reorganization has drawn criticism, particularly regarding the legality of the cuts and the handling of termination notices, which some employees described as irregular. Although Congress has not approved the reorganization plan, the administration aims to complete it by July 1. Many employees, including those actively responding to crises like the recent earthquake in Myanmar, were notified of their layoffs in a manner deemed insensitive. The layoffs represent a more severe reduction than initially anticipated, with even essential personnel receiving termination letters. The administration's approach has raised concerns about its impact on U.S. global standing and national security.
