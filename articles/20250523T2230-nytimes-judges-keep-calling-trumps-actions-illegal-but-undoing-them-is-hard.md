## Article summary
The article discusses recent court rulings against President Trump's administration, which have consistently deemed his actions illegal, including unlawful firings and deportations. Despite these rulings, the article highlights the challenges of reversing Trump's actions due to the slow pace of litigation and the complexities involved. Courts act as a check on Trump's authority, which has often disregarded legal constraints, yet the Republican-controlled Congress provides him with significant immunity from oversight. Notably, a ruling by Judge Reggie B. Walton ordered the reinstatement of members from an independent watchdog agency, while Judge Beryl A. Howell found Trump's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace to be unlawful. However, the administration's appeals and potential budget cuts could hinder the restoration of these entities. Additionally, Judge Myong J. Joun ordered the reinstatement of thousands of fired Education Department employees, but similar budget constraints may affect their return. A more contentious ruling by Judge Brian E. Murphy regarding deportations raises further legal complications, as the deportees’ due process rights were violated. Overall, while courts are pushing back against Trump's actions, the practical implications of these rulings could be limited.
