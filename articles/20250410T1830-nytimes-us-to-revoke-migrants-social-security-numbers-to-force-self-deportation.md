## Article summary
The Trump administration is taking aggressive measures to revoke the temporary legal status of immigrants, with plans to effectively cancel their Social Security numbers to pressure them into self-deportation. This strategy involves repurposing the Social Security death master file to include living individuals deemed as criminals or suspected terrorists, thereby cutting them off from essential financial services and government benefits. The initiative is backed by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, aiming to utilize personal data for immigration enforcement. Concerns arise over potential errors in the data, which could mistakenly label American citizens as deceased, causing severe financial repercussions. The administration has also agreed to share the addresses of 98,000 individuals with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, marking a significant shift in data privacy practices. Critics, including former Social Security officials, have condemned the strategy as inhumane and detrimental to the agency's mission. The changes are framed as necessary for national security, although the criteria for identifying suspected terrorists remain unclear. The administration's approach is expected to face legal challenges due to privacy laws governing Social Security data. Overall, these developments represent a controversial effort to tighten immigration controls and reshape federal data usage.
