## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's frequent use of two-week deadlines for various policy announcements and decisions, a pattern observed since his first term. Recently, he stated he would decide on U.S. military action in the Israel-Iran conflict "within two weeks," echoing similar timelines for issues like tax legislation, healthcare, and tariffs. Despite these promises, many of his deadlines have passed without significant outcomes, leading to skepticism about his commitment to follow through. For instance, he had pledged to resolve the war in Ukraine and provide updates on military assistance, but these promises often resulted in delays or were forgotten. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted that Trump frequently employs this tactic, hoping the public will move on by the time the deadline arrives. Historical examples include his tax plan announcement, which took months to materialize, and his unsuccessful attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act within promised timeframes. Additionally, Trump has made claims about conspiracy theories, asserting that evidence would emerge in two weeks, which never materialized. Overall, the article highlights a consistent trend of unfulfilled promises tied to two-week deadlines throughout Trump's political career.
