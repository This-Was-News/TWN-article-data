## Article summary
A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, which represents clients associated with Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. The order aimed to impose punitive measures, including suspending security clearances for Perkins Coie employees and restricting their interactions with federal employees. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the executive order likely violates the firm's First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights, emphasizing the importance of zealous advocacy in the justice system, even for unpopular causes. She described the order as casting a "chilling harm" across the legal profession, warning it could intimidate attorneys from representing clients with opposing views to the president. The ruling came shortly after Perkins Coie filed a lawsuit against the government, claiming the order undermines constitutional principles. The government's argument, presented by Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, asserted that the president has the authority to act against entities deemed untrustworthy. Perkins Coie reported that the executive order has already negatively affected its business, with clients ending relationships and federal prosecutors refusing meetings with its attorneys. The judge's decision highlights the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and legal representatives of political opponents.
