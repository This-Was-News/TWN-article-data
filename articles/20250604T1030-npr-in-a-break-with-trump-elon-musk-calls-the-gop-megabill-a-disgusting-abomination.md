## Article summary
Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's GOP megabill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on his X social media platform. Musk's comments come as the multi-trillion dollar spending package is progressing through Congress, having narrowly cleared the House. He expressed his disapproval of the bill’s excessive spending, which he believes undermines efforts to reduce the budget deficit. Musk's stance is significant given his influence in Republican politics, having invested heavily in Trump's campaign and GOP candidates. Senate Majority Leader John Thune hopes Musk will reconsider his position following an updated Congressional Budget Office estimate that may reflect potential economic growth from the bill. Other Republican lawmakers, such as Senators Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, have also voiced concerns about the bill's spending levels. Despite Musk's criticism, the White House maintains its support for the legislation, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt stating that President Trump remains committed to the bill. The ongoing debate highlights divisions within the GOP regarding fiscal policy and spending priorities.
