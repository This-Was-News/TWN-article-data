## Article summary
President Trump granted Mexico a 90-day delay on higher tariffs and proposed negotiations for a trade deal, while the rest of the world awaited clarity on impending tariffs set to take effect at midnight. The administration had disclosed some tariff rates but left many specifics unclear just hours before the deadline. Preliminary trade deals with several countries, including Britain, Indonesia, and the European Union, promised increased purchases of American goods and investments, with tariffs ranging from 10 to 20 percent for those with deals and up to 50 percent for others. The administration continued negotiations, including discussions with China to extend a trade truce, while legal challenges to the tariffs were being heard in court. Businesses faced uncertainty about the rules governing international trade, with experts advising caution and flexibility in shipping strategies.
