## Article summary
The article "Left for Dead, the C.F.P.B. Inches Back to Life" discusses the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and its struggles against the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle it. Initially, the CFPB faced significant setbacks, with all 1,700 employees sent home and operations halted. However, recent court orders have temporarily reversed some of these shutdown efforts, allowing the agency to resume critical functions, such as addressing a backlog of consumer complaints. The CFPB's situation highlights the limits of presidential power in unilaterally closing government agencies, as only Congress has the authority to formally shut it down.

Consumer advocates and the agency's union have fought back in court, claiming that the Trump administration's actions violate the law. While some functions have been restored, they remain a small fraction of the bureau's overall responsibilities. The article notes the unusual alliance formed between mortgage lenders and consumer advocates in support of the bureau's survival. The ongoing legal battles and internal conflicts within the agency illustrate the complexities of maintaining its operations amid political pressures. As of now, the future of the CFPB hangs in the balance, with a key court ruling expected soon that could determine its fate.
