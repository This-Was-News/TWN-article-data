## Article summary
The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive Social Security Administration records. The solicitor general, D. John Sauer, argues that a district court's injunction, which restricts access to these records, is unlawful and hampers federal efforts to modernize government systems and combat waste and fraud. Judge Ellen L. Hollander imposed conditions on access, requiring training and background checks to protect personal information. This injunction has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Sauer contends that the executive branch should not be obstructed from performing its duties due to the court's ruling, emphasizing that the need for privacy must not prevent the government from addressing fraud and waste. Judge Hollander acknowledged the public interest in rooting out fraud but insisted that legal protocols must be followed. The Supreme Court has ordered opposing parties to respond to the administration's application by May 12. The ongoing legal battles reflect broader tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary over executive power and access to government data.
