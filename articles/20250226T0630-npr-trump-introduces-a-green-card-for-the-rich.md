## Article summary
Trump has announced a new immigration initiative called the "gold card," which will allow wealthy foreigners to obtain lawful permanent residency in the U.S. for a fee of $5 million. This program is intended to replace the existing EB-5 investor visa, which requires lower investment amounts but has faced criticism for fraud and inefficiency. Trump emphasized that the gold card would attract "very high-level people" who would contribute significantly to the economy through spending and taxes, potentially aiding in deficit reduction. The rollout of the program is expected within two weeks, with a promise of thorough vetting for applicants. Trump's Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, supported the initiative, dismissing the previous EB-5 program as ineffective. The proposal has raised questions regarding its appeal to wealthy individuals, including Russian oligarchs, to which Trump responded humorously. Overall, the gold card aims to bring affluent immigrants to the U.S., offering them a fast track to citizenship.
