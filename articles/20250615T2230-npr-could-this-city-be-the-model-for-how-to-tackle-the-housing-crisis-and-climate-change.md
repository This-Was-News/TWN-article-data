## Article summary
Vienna has emerged as a model for addressing the dual challenges of the housing crisis and climate change through its extensive social housing program, where nearly half of its 2 million residents live in government-supported homes. These dwellings are designed with climate-friendly features such as solar panels, thick insulation, and communal green spaces, which contribute to energy efficiency and comfort year-round. The city’s innovative approach includes competitions among developers to encourage eco-friendly designs, ensuring that both affordability and sustainability are prioritized. Vienna aims to transition all its buildings off fossil fuels by 2040, utilizing geothermal energy and electric heat pumps in its housing stock.

As U.S. cities face rising rental costs and climate-related threats, they are looking to Vienna's model for inspiration. Efforts in cities like Chicago and Denver are underway to create green, affordable housing, recognizing the need for mixed-income developments to ensure inclusivity. The success of Vienna's social housing lies in its ability to provide quality living conditions across different income levels, fostering a sense of community among residents. Overall, the document emphasizes the feasibility of adopting similar strategies in American cities, highlighting that proactive measures can shape a sustainable future for urban living.
