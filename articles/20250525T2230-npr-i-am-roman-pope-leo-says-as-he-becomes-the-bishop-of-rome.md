## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV officially declared himself a Roman during a ceremonial Mass at the St. John Lateran Basilica, marking his formal role as bishop of Rome. This title is one among many held by the pope. Prior to the Mass, he met with Rome's mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, who expressed the city's readiness to support the pontiff in a new political paradigm. In response, Pope Leo affirmed his commitment to the people of Rome, stating, "Today I can say in a special way that I am a Roman, with and for you." 

Margaret Susan Thompson, a history professor, noted that the pope will not be heavily involved in daily governance, as these responsibilities typically fall to an auxiliary bishop. Thompson described the pope's declaration as a symbolic gesture, emphasizing his pastoral duty to the people of Rome, rather than a rejection of his citizenship in the United States or Peru. Born in Chicago and having spent significant time in Peru, Pope Leo is the first pope from the U.S., following a line of non-Italian predecessors. Overall, his statement is seen as an important symbolic and pastoral affirmation of his connection to Rome.
