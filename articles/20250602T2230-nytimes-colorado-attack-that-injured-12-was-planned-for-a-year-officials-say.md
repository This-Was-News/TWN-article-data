## Article summary
Mohamed Sabry Soliman has been charged with a hate crime after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, who were supporting hostages held in Gaza. The attack, which resulted in eight people being hospitalized, was motivated by Soliman's expressed desire to kill all Zionists, and he had reportedly planned the assault for a year. Soliman, who entered the U.S. from Egypt in August 2022 and overstayed his visa, used the incendiary devices because he was unable to purchase a gun due to his immigration status. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic, with flames and injured victims, including a Holocaust survivor. The incident has heightened concerns among the Jewish community in the U.S., which has faced rising antisemitism, especially following recent violent events. Federal officials have stated that Soliman faces multiple counts of attempted murder, with potential life sentences. The attack has been linked to a disturbing pattern of antisemitic violence amidst the ongoing conflict in Gaza, leading to increased fears for Jewish safety. Local authorities condemned the attack, emphasizing that violence is never an acceptable response to political differences. The Boulder community has responded with sorrow and solidarity, as the weekly demonstrations have been canceled indefinitely due to safety concerns.
