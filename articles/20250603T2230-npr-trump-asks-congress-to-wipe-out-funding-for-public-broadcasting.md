## Article summary
President Trump has formally requested Congress to eliminate $1.1 billion in funding for public broadcasters, including PBS and NPR, as part of a broader budget rescission package. This initiative reflects his ongoing conflict with major cultural institutions and is fueled by allegations from his Republican allies that these organizations exhibit partisan bias. PBS President Paula Kerger and NPR CEO Katherine Maher have voiced strong opposition, warning that such cuts would severely impact local programming and emergency services, particularly in rural areas. The request is part of a larger $9.4 billion budget cut proposal, which also includes reductions to foreign aid programs.

While many Republicans support the cuts, some, like Senator Lisa Murkowski, advocate for retaining funding due to the crucial services public broadcasting provides. Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, criticize Trump's actions as politically motivated and detrimental to free press. The rescission request has sparked significant lobbying efforts from public broadcasting advocates, emphasizing the importance of these services for local news and educational content. Although Congress has 45 days to consider the request, the last successful rescission was decades ago, raising doubts about its approval. Trump's previous attempts to exert control over public broadcasting have led to ongoing legal challenges, but his latest request is legally permissible and has initiated a new wave of advocacy from public media supporters.
