## Article summary
The article discusses how President Trump's policies have introduced risks to the traditionally stable U.S. Treasury bonds, which investors typically view as a safe haven during crises. The ongoing trade war with China has raised concerns about a potential global economic downturn, undermining confidence in U.S. governance and leading to a significant sell-off in the bond market. This has resulted in a sharp increase in Treasury yields, which in turn raises borrowing costs across the economy, affecting mortgages and loans. Analysts note that the chaotic implementation of tariffs has contributed to a perception of the U.S. as a source of volatility rather than stability. Critics argue that Trump's approach is damaging American industrial prospects and could lead to a recession, as higher interest rates may limit consumer spending. The article highlights a growing sentiment among foreign investors that lending to the U.S. is becoming riskier, potentially leading to a decrease in demand for U.S. debt. While the dollar remains the primary global currency, its status is increasingly questioned amidst these developments. The European economy and its currency could benefit from this shift, especially if they issue more bonds to attract investors. Overall, the article paints a picture of uncertainty in global finance, with the U.S. losing its status as a safe investment.
