## Article summary
TikTok has emerged as a popular platform for sharing ADHD advice, particularly among teens and young adults, but much of the information can be misleading. A recent study indicates that less than half of the claims made in top TikTok videos align with scientific criteria for diagnosing ADHD. Many videos oversimplify symptoms and lack credible sources, potentially leading viewers to misinterpret their own experiences. The study highlighted that excessive consumption of this content can negatively affect individuals' perceptions of their symptoms, making them feel worse about their condition. While TikTok provides a sense of community and has helped some individuals seek diagnoses after years of being overlooked, therapists warn that the platform often blurs the line between ADHD and other mental health issues. Moreover, the entertaining nature of TikTok content often overshadows more conventional, scientifically grounded information. This trend raises concerns about self-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment among users, particularly regarding stimulant misuse. Despite these issues, some experts believe TikTok can serve as a starting point for discussions about ADHD, emphasizing the need for rigorous research into the content shared on social media.
