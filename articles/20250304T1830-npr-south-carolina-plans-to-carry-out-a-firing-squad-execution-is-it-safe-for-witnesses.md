## Article summary
South Carolina is set to execute Brad Sigmon by firing squad on March 7, marking the state's first such execution and the first in the U.S. in 15 years. Concerns have arisen regarding the safety of the indoor execution setup, as firearms experts question the risks involved for both the execution team and witnesses. Sigmon, who was sentenced to death for a 2002 double homicide, will be strapped to a chair in a small death chamber where he will be shot at by three prison employees from about 15 feet away. Unlike Utah's protocol, where one shooter uses a blank, all three guns in South Carolina will be loaded with live ammunition.

Experts warn that the confined space increases the likelihood of ricochets and exposure to lead particles and noxious gases, which are hazardous in indoor environments. Additionally, the noise from simultaneous gunfire using .308-caliber ammunition could pose a risk of hearing damage, yet there is no indication that hearing protection will be provided. Former executioner Craig Baxley expressed disbelief at the decision to conduct the execution indoors, suggesting it could lead to unnecessary risks. The execution protocol lacks the detailed transparency seen in other states, raising further concerns about the procedures and the potential trauma for witnesses. Sigmon chose the firing squad over lethal injection, believing it to be a more reliable method following reports of previous botched executions. If executed, he will be the oldest person put to death in South Carolina.
