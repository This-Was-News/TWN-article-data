## Article summary
Israel has resumed significant airstrikes in Gaza, marking the first major military action since a cease-fire began in January. The health ministry in Gaza reports that over 400 people have been killed in these strikes, which target Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the military operation was initiated due to Hamas's refusal to release hostages. The renewed conflict raises concerns of a return to all-out war, as the strikes occurred during ongoing negotiations for a truce extension. Hamas has accused Israel of violating the cease-fire agreement, while Israeli officials claim the attacks are necessary for security.

The strikes have caused widespread fear among Palestinians, with many recalling the devastation of previous military campaigns. Israeli military actions have led to evacuation orders for residents near the Gaza border, indicating potential ground operations may follow. The situation is further complicated by stalled negotiations regarding the release of hostages and the future governance of Gaza. Critics of Netanyahu's government suggest the military campaign may be politically motivated, aimed at deflecting attention from domestic issues. Overall, the escalation in violence highlights the fragile nature of peace in the region and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.
