## Article summary
The article discusses the turmoil within the Veterans Affairs (V.A.) mental health system, exacerbated by recent changes mandated by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. A chaotic restructuring has led to mental health providers being required to conduct therapy from crowded office spaces, jeopardizing patient privacy and violating ethical standards. This policy reversal comes after the V.A. had successfully implemented remote care to better serve veterans, particularly those in isolated areas. Many clinicians are concerned that these changes will degrade the quality of mental health services, leading to increased wait times and a potential mass exodus of specialists. Layoffs of probationary employees have further strained the system, impacting support for vulnerable veterans, including those who are homeless or suicidal. Veterans themselves are expressing anxiety over the potential loss of their trusted therapists and the disruption of their care. The V.A. has dismissed concerns about privacy, asserting that accommodations will be made to ensure compliance with standards. Clinicians warn that the current environment compromises the essential trust needed for effective psychotherapy. As a result, many mental health workers are considering leaving the V.A., which already faces significant staffing shortages. Overall, the article highlights a concerning shift in the V.A.'s approach to mental health care amidst a broader government restructuring.
