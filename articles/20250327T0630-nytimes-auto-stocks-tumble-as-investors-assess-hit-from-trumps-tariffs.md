## Article summary
Auto stocks experienced a significant decline following President Trump's announcement of a 25 percent tariff on imported cars and parts, set to begin next week. The tariffs are expected to disrupt the complex supply chains of major automakers, particularly affecting companies that export vehicles from Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Shares of prominent automakers like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW fell between 2 to 4 percent in early European trading, while Stellantis saw a decline of about 4 percent. Japanese carmakers Toyota, Honda, and Nissan also reported declines of around 2 percent in Tokyo, and South Korean companies Hyundai and Kia dropped 3 to 5 percent. Detroit-based automakers General Motors and Ford were not spared, with GM shares down over 6 percent and Ford down 3 percent in premarket trading. The overall market reaction saw major stock indexes in exporting countries like Germany, South Korea, and Japan decline as well. Notably, Tesla's shares remained relatively stable, as it produces all its vehicles sold in the U.S. domestically. The announcement of the tariffs has raised concerns about the impact on the automotive industry, which relies heavily on imported parts and vehicles. Nearly half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, highlighting the potential widespread effects of these tariffs.
