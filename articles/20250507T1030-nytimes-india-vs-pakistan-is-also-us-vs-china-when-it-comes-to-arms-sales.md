## Article summary
The recent military tensions between India and Pakistan have highlighted the evolving dynamics of arms sales and alliances in South Asia, especially in the context of U.S.-China relations. Following a 2019 confrontation that raised nuclear alarm, the situation escalated again after a terrorist attack in Kashmir, prompting India to seek military action with U.S. support. India has shifted from its Cold War-era reliance on Russia for arms to purchasing significant military equipment from the U.S. and its allies. Conversely, Pakistan, whose importance to the U.S. has diminished, has increasingly turned to China for military supplies, now receiving about 80% of its arms from Beijing. This shift in alliances has injected superpower politics into the longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan, complicating the regional security landscape. The deteriorating relations between India and China, alongside the U.S.-China tensions, further exacerbate the volatility of the region. Military confrontations remain a risk, as both nations possess well-armed forces operating in close proximity, which could lead to catastrophic escalations from minor incidents. The historical context of arms sales and alliances illustrates a significant transformation in South Asia's geopolitical dynamics.
