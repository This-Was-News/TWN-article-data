## Article summary
The James Webb Space Telescope has potentially detected gases in the atmosphere of the exoplanet K2-18b that could indicate the presence of life, specifically dimethyl sulfide or dimethyl disulfide, which are produced by marine microbes on Earth. While researcher Nikku Madhusudhan describes the findings as revolutionary, he emphasizes the need for further confirmation through additional observations. Some astronomers, however, express skepticism, noting that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The planet orbits a cool dwarf star in the habitable zone, suggesting conditions that could support liquid water and life. 

Although initial findings suggested the presence of life-associated gases, previous attempts to confirm these signals were inconclusive. The current data, gathered using a more suitable telescope instrument, shows promising signs, but scientists caution against jumping to conclusions. The concentration of these gases, if confirmed, would be significantly higher than on Earth, but researchers must also consider non-biological processes that could produce them. The discovery has invigorated discussions about the potential for life beyond our solar system, but experts stress the importance of rigorous analysis and verification in this emerging field.
