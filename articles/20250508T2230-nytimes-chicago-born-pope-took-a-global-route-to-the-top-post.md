## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV, the first American pontiff, was elected on Thursday, marking a historic moment in the Roman Catholic Church. Robert Francis Prevost, previously the leader of the Augustinians, advocates for the poor and migrants, reflecting a commitment similar to that of his predecessor, Pope Francis. His election was unexpected, given the church's traditional reluctance to choose a pope from a global superpower. In his inaugural address, he emphasized the need for a missionary church that builds bridges and fosters dialogue. Prevost, who has spent much of his life outside the U.S., is seen as a balanced figure amidst ideological divides within the church. His past includes serving as a bishop in Peru and holding influential positions in the Vatican. While he has faced criticism over handling sexual abuse cases, friends describe him as humble and collaborative. His election has been met with excitement, particularly in Chicago, where he has strong ties. Overall, Pope Leo XIV represents a blend of American perspective and global outreach in the church.
