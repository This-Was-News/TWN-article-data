## Article summary
India and Pakistan announced a cease-fire after days of intense conflict involving drone strikes and missile fire, mediated by the United States. Despite the agreement, reports of continued shelling emerged shortly after, with both nations accusing each other of violations. The escalation followed a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, which India attributed to Pakistan, leading to military confrontations. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, engaged with both sides to facilitate the cease-fire and future discussions. Global leaders expressed relief at the cease-fire, emphasizing the need for de-escalation. The recent conflict marked the first large-scale use of attack drones by both countries, signaling a new phase in their military engagements. As tensions remain high, the situation in Kashmir is still precarious, with the potential for future violence looming. Pakistan reopened its airspace following the cease-fire, which had been closed during the conflict. The cease-fire's success is uncertain, given the historical context of Indo-Pakistani relations and ongoing territorial disputes. Moving forward, both nations will likely continue to shape narratives regarding their military actions and the cease-fire's implications.
