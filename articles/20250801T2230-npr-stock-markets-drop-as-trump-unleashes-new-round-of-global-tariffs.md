## Article summary
Stock markets experienced a significant decline on Friday, driven by two major factors: the announcement of new global tariffs by President Trump and a weaker-than-expected jobs report for July. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, and job creation fell short of expectations, fueling investor concerns about the economic impact of the tariffs. Major indices like the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw notable drops, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling over 2%. This downturn marks a shift from the optimism seen earlier in the summer, as investors had previously shrugged off the initial tariff announcements. The weak jobs data and the new tariffs are likely to increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at its next meeting in September.
