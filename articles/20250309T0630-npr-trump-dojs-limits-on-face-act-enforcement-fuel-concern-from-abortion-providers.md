## Article summary
The Trump administration's Justice Department has significantly limited the enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, raising concerns among abortion providers and advocates. New leadership views past enforcement as an example of "weaponization" against conservatives and will only pursue violations in extreme cases involving death or serious property damage. This shift has led to the dismissal of several FACE Act cases, including one against an anti-abortion activist who disrupted a clinic in Philadelphia. Abortion-rights advocates fear that these changes will embolden individuals to disrupt clinics without fear of repercussions, potentially increasing violence and harassment against providers. 

The FACE Act, established in the 1990s to curb violence against abortion clinics, has historically seen varying levels of enforcement, with Democratic administrations typically more active. Supporters of the law argue that it has effectively reduced significant threats to clinic safety. Meanwhile, opponents of the law, including some anti-abortion activists, welcome the new policy, believing it will allow for more disruptive actions against abortion facilities. Activists on both sides express mixed feelings about the implications of these changes, with some anticipating increased confrontations at clinics. The situation reflects a broader national debate over reproductive rights and the legal protections surrounding them.
