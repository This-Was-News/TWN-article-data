## Article summary
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, announced plans to revoke the 2009 endangerment finding, a scientific determination that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. This move, the largest deregulatory action in U.S. history, would eliminate the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The proposal aligns with President Trump's efforts to dismantle federal climate initiatives and contradicts overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. Critics argue that the move prioritizes fossil fuel interests and will hinder global efforts to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The EPA's decision is expected to face legal challenges and has drawn mixed reactions from industry groups and politicians.
