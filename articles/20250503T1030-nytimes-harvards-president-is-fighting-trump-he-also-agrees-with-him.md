## Article summary
Harvard President Alan Garber is engaged in a legal battle with the Trump administration, which is attempting to revoke Harvard's federal funding and tax-exempt status over issues including campus antisemitism. Despite their disagreements, Garber acknowledges the need for cultural reforms at Harvard, noting that the university has historically silenced opposing viewpoints. The Trump administration's aggressive tactics have prompted Garber to defend Harvard's independence, leading to a lawsuit against the federal government for overreach. Garber, who has a background in health policy, has made significant changes during his presidency, including addressing antisemitism and revising diversity policies. He faces criticism from both students and faculty regarding his responses to federal demands and the handling of diversity programs. Yet, supporters commend his leadership amidst a crisis, emphasizing the importance of ideological diversity in academia. Garber's goal is to ensure that universities can fulfill their educational missions without government interference. As he navigates these challenges, he remains focused on fostering an environment conducive to free expression and academic integrity.
