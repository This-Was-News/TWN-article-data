## Article summary
Democrats recently achieved significant gains in elections, notably winning a key State Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, which energizes their base amid a challenging political landscape dominated by Trump. Despite these victories, Democrats face daunting realities, including low popularity and limited power in Washington. The Wisconsin win serves as a rebuke to Elon Musk, who financially backed the losing conservative candidate, highlighting a resurgence in Democratic enthusiasm. Pollster John Anzalone emphasized that such wins provide a psychological boost, particularly with an important gubernatorial race in Virginia approaching. Democrats have also flipped Republican-held seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania and saw voters reject constitutional amendments in Louisiana. However, the broader question remains whether this momentum will translate into national success, as turnout remains crucial. Democrats believe that discontent with the Trump administration's agenda, particularly regarding cuts to services, could galvanize support. The outcomes of these special elections may indicate fundraising potential and momentum for upcoming midterms, although they are not definitive predictors. Overall, while Democratic victories are promising, they must also focus on connecting with working-class voters to sustain their gains.
