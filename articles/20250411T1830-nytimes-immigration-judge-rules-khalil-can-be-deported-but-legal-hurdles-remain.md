## Article summary
An immigration judge in Louisiana has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Columbia University graduate, can be deported, marking a significant move by the Trump administration to address pro-Palestinian demonstrations on U.S. college campuses. Judge Jamee E. Comans asserted that the government's claim, based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's memo linking Khalil's presence to antisemitism, met the required burden of evidence, despite the lack of concrete supporting documentation. Khalil's legal team argues that he is being targeted for exercising his constitutional right to free speech. 

During the hearing, Khalil criticized the process, stating that due process and fairness were absent. The judge limited the discussion to the issue of removability and denied requests for cross-examination of Rubio or to delay the hearing for further evidence review. Khalil's supporters expressed distress at the ruling, while his lawyers vowed to continue the fight for his right to remain in the U.S. 

Khalil's case will now proceed to a relief stage, where his lawyers can argue for his stay in the country, with the possibility of appealing to higher authorities if necessary. Additionally, a federal court in New Jersey is also reviewing the constitutional issues surrounding his case, with a judge there having ordered that Khalil not be removed from the country for the time being.
