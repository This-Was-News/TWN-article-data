## Article summary
During his Middle East tour, President Trump adopted a contrasting approach to foreign relations compared to his domestic stance. While at home, he aggressively pursues investigations against political opponents, he promotes forgiveness abroad, emphasizing a willingness to move past conflicts for the sake of peace and economic benefits. He announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, praising the new president, Ahmed al-Shara, despite his past ties to Al Qaeda. Trump's admiration for strongman leaders is evident in his interactions with figures like Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His outreach to Iran, despite past animosities, suggests a desire for diplomatic resolution over military conflict, as he seeks to negotiate a deal to prevent nuclear armament. Trump expressed a hope for cooperation from Qatar in addressing the nuclear situation with Iran, indicating a shift towards fostering partnerships even with former adversaries. He remains cautious, however, warning Iran of consequences should negotiations fail. Trump's approach reflects a broader strategy of prioritizing stability and economic opportunity in international relations while maintaining a confrontational stance domestically.
