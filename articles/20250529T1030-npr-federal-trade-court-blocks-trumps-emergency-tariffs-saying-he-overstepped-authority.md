## Article summary
A federal trade court has ruled that many tariffs imposed by President Trump, including those affecting most countries and specific tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, are illegal. The Court of International Trade determined that the tariffs exceeded Trump's authority under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration cited when implementing them. The court emphasized that the Constitution grants tariff power to Congress, not the President. In response, the White House rejected the ruling, asserting that it is not for judges to dictate how a national emergency should be addressed. The court's decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by 12 states and five businesses, which argued against the tariffs. Although the court found the broad tariffs unlawful, it also ruled against the fentanyl-related tariffs, stating they did not directly address the drug trade emergency as required by IEEPA. The judges, appointed by past presidents from both parties, highlighted the need for tariffs to directly deal with cited emergencies. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield celebrated the ruling as a victory for families and businesses, describing Trump's tariffs as reckless and economically damaging. The White House has not confirmed whether it will appeal the decision.
