## Article summary
Tariffs have significantly impacted the auto industry, increasing costs for materials like aluminum and steel, as well as foreign-made parts and imported vehicles. Despite these costs, automakers have not passed them on to consumers, with new vehicle transaction prices rising only 1.2% year over year in June, which is lower than the typical annual increase. Automakers have absorbed these costs, with companies like General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, and Volkswagen reporting substantial tariff bills. To mitigate the impact, some automakers are moving production to the United States and squeezing costs elsewhere. Eventually, however, executives indicate that costs will be passed on to consumers, with price increases expected for the 2026 model year vehicles, potentially rising by 4 to 8%. Additionally, consumers may see more subtle cost increases, such as higher financing rates and reduced cash back offers.
