## Article summary
Lou Schachter, a retired corporate consultant and true crime enthusiast, became intrigued by the 1985 theft of Willem de Kooning's "Woman-Ochre" from the University of Arizona Museum of Art. After the painting was recovered in 2017, Schachter's curiosity led him to investigate further, uncovering a potential connection to another art heist. His research revealed that two paintings, "Aspens" by Victor Higgins and "Oklahoma Cheyenne" by Joseph Henry Sharp, stolen from the Harwood Museum of Art in 1985, might have been part of the same scheme. Schachter's findings were shared with the Harwood Museum, which then involved the FBI. The FBI successfully recovered the stolen paintings, which were returned to the Harwood Museum and are now on display. Schachter believes the Alters, who were never criminally charged, may have stolen other artworks, but he has no proof yet.
