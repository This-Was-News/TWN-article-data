## Article summary
The National Park Service (NPS) is implementing new signage across all national sites, asking visitors to identify any content they feel negatively portrays American history. This initiative follows directives from President Trump's executive order aimed at promoting a more positive narrative about America's past. The signs will encourage public feedback through QR codes and other methods, specifically targeting information that might be seen as disparaging to Americans or that fails to highlight the beauty of the landscapes. The directive requires a review of public-facing content by mid-July, impacting not just the NPS but also other Department of the Interior groups, though it excludes Native American lands unless they are part of NPS sites. Supporters of the initiative argue it emphasizes accuracy in storytelling, while critics express concerns about the potential rewriting of history. Theresa Pierno from the National Parks Conservation Association warns that altering historical narratives based on visitor preferences could be dangerous. The NPS aims to ensure that national parks serve as places for celebrating America's heritage without political bias. The changes reflect a broader push to reshape how American history is presented to the public.
