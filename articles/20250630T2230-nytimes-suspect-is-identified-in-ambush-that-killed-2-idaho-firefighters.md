## Article summary
The suspect in the deadly ambush of firefighters in Idaho has been identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley from Coeur d'Alene. He was found dead at the scene, where he allegedly opened fire on firefighters responding to a brush fire that appeared to be intentionally set to lure them in. Two firefighters were killed, and a third was seriously injured during the attack on Canfield Mountain, a popular recreational area. Law enforcement exchanged gunfire with Roley, and his body was discovered later using cellphone signal data. Roley had expressed interest in becoming a forest firefighter and had recently moved to Idaho, living independently and working for a tree company. His grandfather described him as optimistic and said they had not spoken recently. The firefighting crew had received a call about the fire shortly before being shot at, but the caller was not believed to be the suspect. Over 300 law enforcement officers responded to the scene, including the FBI. The rugged terrain of Canfield Mountain is typically safe for outdoor activities, making the incident particularly shocking to the community.
