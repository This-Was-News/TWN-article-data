## Article summary
Steve Wtkoff, an envoy for President Trump, met with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin for the fifth time this year to discuss potential new sanctions against Russia. The meeting, described as pivotal by Trump, lasted about three hours, with both sides calling it productive. However, there was no immediate clarity on the outcomes. Trump announced increased tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil and considered similar measures for other countries. Despite previous meetings not leading to breakthroughs in ending the Ukraine war, this meeting held significance due to an impending deadline set by Trump for Putin to make peace. Wtkoff, a long-time friend of Trump, has had extraordinary access to Putin, facilitating prisoner exchanges and calls between the two leaders. Trump has recently soured on Putin, while Putin has engaged with Trump without showing willingness to compromise on his goals in Ukraine. Trump gave Moscow a deadline to end the conflict or face new financial penalties. Meanwhile, Russia continued its advances and attacks on Ukraine, with recent drone strikes killing and injuring civilians. Zelensky discussed the call with Trump and European leaders, emphasizing the need for the war to end.
