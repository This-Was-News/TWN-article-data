## Article summary
On April 15, 2025, President Trump directed a national security investigation into the importation of critical minerals following China's export suspension amid ongoing trade tensions. A federal judge, Paula Xinis, criticized the Trump administration for failing to comply with a Supreme Court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a man wrongfully deported to El Salvador. The judge expressed concern over the administration's delays and indicated she would compel officials to provide detailed information regarding their efforts to secure his release. The case highlights the administration's contentious stance on immigration and its willingness to defy court orders. Meanwhile, Trump threatened Harvard University's tax-exempt status after the school rejected demands related to its policies, leading to a freeze on over $2 billion in federal funding. The administration's approach to Harvard reflects a broader strategy to confront perceived ideological biases in academia. In a related development, Trump announced plans to investigate tariffs on imported medicines, raising concerns about potential drug shortages and higher prices for Americans. Critics argue these tariffs could exacerbate existing issues in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Overall, these developments illustrate the administration's aggressive posture on multiple fronts, including immigration, education, and trade.
