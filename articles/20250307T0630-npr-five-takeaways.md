China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticized former President Trump's "two-faced" policies during a press conference, emphasizing the need for a more honest and cooperative relationship between China and the U.S. He condemned the recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, asserting that they undermine stability and trust. Wang highlighted that the U.S. should take responsibility for issues like fentanyl and criticized its confrontational approach, suggesting it has not yielded positive results in trade relations.

He also addressed the implications of Trump's "America First" policy, warning that such self-interest could destabilize the international order. Wang reaffirmed the strength of China-Russia relations, stating that their partnership is resilient and not influenced by external factors. Regarding the Ukraine war, he expressed China's willingness to mediate for peace, while emphasizing the complexity of the situation.

On the issue of Gaza, Wang firmly stated that it belongs to the Palestinian people and called for respect for their rights and a focus on humanitarian aid. Overall, Wang positioned China as a stabilizing force in a world increasingly affected by U.S. policies.
