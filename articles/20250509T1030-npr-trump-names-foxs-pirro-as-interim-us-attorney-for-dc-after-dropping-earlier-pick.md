## Article summary
President Trump has appointed Jeanine Pirro, a Fox News host, as the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., after withdrawing his previous pick, Ed Martin. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications, highlighting her experience as a prosecutor and state judge in New York. Martin, who faced opposition due to his lack of prosecutorial experience and controversial views on the January 6th Capitol attack, had been serving in the role since Trump's inauguration. The U.S. Attorney's office in D.C. is considered a critical federal law enforcement position. Pirro's appointment continues Trump's trend of nominating individuals from Fox News for significant roles.

Martin's nomination collapsed amid controversies, including his defense of January 6 defendants and promotion of conspiracy theories. Senator Thom Tillis publicly opposed Martin, stating that the events of January 6 were wrong and not instigated by outside forces. Following the withdrawal, Trump indicated plans to appoint Martin to other roles within the Department of Justice that do not require Senate confirmation. Martin expressed disappointment over the failed nomination, while Trump emphasized the need to focus on other priorities. The changes reflect ongoing tensions and political maneuvering within Trump's administration.
