## Article summary
The White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) has canceled comedian Amber Ruffin's scheduled appearance at the upcoming White House Correspondents' Dinner on April 26, 2025. This decision marks a departure from tradition, as the event typically features a comedian. WHCA President Eugene Daniels stated that the board unanimously chose to forgo a comedian to keep the focus on honoring journalists' work and fostering mentorship for future journalists. Ruffin was previously announced as a fitting choice for the current political and cultural climate. 

The annual dinner has been a fixture since 1921, often attended by U.S. presidents, though Donald Trump opted out during his first term. The event has faced criticism for perceived closeness between the media and the White House, with protests occurring in recent years. Previous entertainers at the dinner have included notable figures like Trevor Noah and Colin Jost. It remains uncertain whether Trump will attend this year, as the White House press secretary has indicated she will not. The WHCA continues to advocate for transparency and access in White House reporting.
