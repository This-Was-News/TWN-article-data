## Article summary
Iranian strikes on Israel resulted in at least eight fatalities, including four in the city of Petah Tikva, as the conflict between the two nations escalated. The strikes targeted populated areas, with missiles hitting residential blocks and causing significant destruction. An 80-year-old man also died when his home collapsed due to a shock wave from a strike in Bnei Brak. Reports indicate that nearly 100 individuals were injured across central Israel, with ongoing search and rescue operations. The Iranian missiles also struck Israel's largest oil refinery in Haifa Bay, igniting a fire and trapping people. The attacks followed Israeli air raids on multiple locations in Iran, marking the most intense fighting between the two nations in decades. Casualties in Iran have reportedly reached at least 224, including high-ranking security officials, while 21 Israeli civilians have died in retaliatory strikes. The conflict raises concerns about a potential broader regional war involving other global powers. The ongoing violence has significantly disrupted internet access in Iran, hindering communication and emergency services.
