## Article summary
The article discusses how allies of President Trump are seeking to leverage commitments from elite law firms to provide pro bono legal work for various causes he supports. Greta Van Susteren, a conservative media personality, sought assistance from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom to help a veteran facing legal issues, but the firm declined direct representation and offered limited support instead. Following agreements made between the Trump administration and several large law firms to provide nearly $1 billion in pro bono services, requests for legal help from veterans and other groups surged. Firms like Kirkland & Ellis and Paul Weiss are experiencing an influx of requests, with many veterans misunderstanding the nature of the pro bono commitments as open invitations for legal assistance. While firms are trying to fulfill their commitments, they face challenges in maintaining their autonomy and addressing requests that may not align with traditional pro bono criteria. Some lawyers within these firms are resistant to working on cases that fulfill Trump’s pro bono terms, indicating internal dissent. The article highlights the complexities and tensions emerging from these pro bono agreements, particularly regarding the definition and execution of such legal services. Overall, law firms are navigating uncharted territory as they balance their commitments with their reputations and staff interests.
