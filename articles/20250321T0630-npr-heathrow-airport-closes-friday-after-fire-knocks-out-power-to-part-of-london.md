## Article summary
Heathrow Airport, Europe's busiest airport, has closed for the entire day following a fire at an electrical substation that caused a power outage. The incident occurred just before the airport was scheduled to open, disrupting over 1,000 flights and affecting hundreds of thousands of passengers. More than 100 flights already en route were diverted, with airlines like United and Qantas rerouting their aircraft to other airports. Authorities have advised passengers to avoid traveling to Heathrow until it reopens, which is expected to be at least by midnight local time. 

In addition to flight disruptions, the fire has led to the cessation of all train services to the airport and power outages for over 16,000 homes in the vicinity. The London Fire Brigade is actively battling the blaze, which has prompted numerous emergency calls from local residents due to the significant smoke. The situation is reminiscent of a prior air traffic control issue in 2023 that also caused widespread delays across UK airports. A spokesperson for Heathrow anticipates ongoing significant disruptions in the coming days as airlines work to adjust their flight schedules.
