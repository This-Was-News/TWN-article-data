## Article summary
The "No Kings" protests are set to take place nationwide, coinciding with a military parade organized by the Trump administration to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday. Approximately 2,000 protests are planned, with organizers accusing Trump of using the parade as a display of dominance and a celebration of his presidency. The protests aim to reject authoritarianism and promote democracy, with participants rallying under the motto "no thrones, no crowns, no kings." 

The demonstrations are coordinated by over 200 organizations, including the ACLU and the American Federation of Teachers, and will occur in every state except Washington, D.C., where residents are encouraged to join the main protest in Philadelphia. The event is expected to cost between $25 and $45 million and will feature thousands of soldiers, aircraft, vehicles, and horses. 

Organizers emphasize nonviolence and conflict de-escalation during the protests. Trump has responded to the planned demonstrations, stating he does not feel like a king and has criticized the protesters. The protests began in response to various Trump administration policies, including immigration crackdowns and workforce reductions.
