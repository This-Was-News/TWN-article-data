## Article summary
The House of Representatives has passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act), which introduces significant changes to voter registration, including a requirement for individuals to provide proof of U.S. citizenship. The bill passed with a vote of 220-208, primarily supported by Republicans and facing criticism for potentially disenfranchising millions of eligible voters who may lack easy access to necessary documents. Critics argue that the legislation could depress voter turnout, especially among marginalized groups. 

The SAVE Act mandates that voters provide citizenship documents when registering or updating their registrations, with concerns that this could disproportionately affect married women and those living in rural areas. Additionally, the bill requires in-person verification of documents at election offices, complicating the registration process. Election officials express worries about the feasibility of implementing these requirements and the potential legal repercussions for errors. 

Supporters of the bill claim it is necessary for election integrity, despite a lack of evidence for widespread noncitizen voting. The legislation also allows states to access federal immigration data to check voter rolls, raising concerns about accuracy and potential wrongful disenfranchisement. Overall, the SAVE Act has sparked considerable debate about voting rights and access in the U.S.
