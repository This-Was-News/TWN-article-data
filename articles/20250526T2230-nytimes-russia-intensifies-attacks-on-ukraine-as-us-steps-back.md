## Article summary
Russia has intensified its aerial bombardments on Ukrainian cities, launching over 1,390 drones and 94 missiles in the past week, resulting in civilian casualties. This escalation coincides with a perceived retreat by the U.S. from its supportive role in the conflict, as President Trump criticized both Putin’s actions and Ukrainian President Zelensky's rhetoric. Despite condemning the attacks, Trump has not committed to providing military assistance to Ukraine, which is facing dwindling resources and support. Analysts suggest that the U.S. withdrawal from diplomatic efforts has emboldened Russia, allowing it to exploit the situation. Ukraine's military is struggling with a shortage of interceptor missiles, raising concerns about the effectiveness of its defense systems against Russian advancements. Former military leaders warn that without significant changes, Ukraine will continue to face severe challenges, particularly in retaining control over key territories in the Donbas region. Russia's numerical superiority in military resources remains a critical factor in the ongoing conflict, with expectations of escalating pressure as summer approaches. The situation underscores a complex dynamic where diplomatic negotiations appear stalled, leaving both nations to navigate a precarious battlefield.
