## Article summary
Experts are expressing concern about the safety of the food supply following federal cutbacks initiated during the Trump administration, which have significantly impacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Former USDA inspector Paula Soldner highlights that remaining inspectors are now required to oversee double the usual number of facilities, raising doubts about the legitimacy of food safety inspections. The loss of expertise and morale among federal workers poses a risk of increased foodborne illness outbreaks, exemplified by a recent listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meats. The federal food safety system is described as being on the brink of collapse, with experts worried about the rollback of safety regulations and cuts to essential programs. The USDA has claimed that its commitment to food safety remains unchanged, even as it encouraged inspectors to take early retirement. Additionally, the closure of two FDA food testing labs has disrupted seafood inspections and routine produce testing, exacerbating the challenges faced by the food safety system. State and local food safety programs, historically supported by the CDC, are also at risk due to budget cuts, leading to concerns about delayed public notifications during outbreaks. Overall, the combination of staff reductions, increased workloads, and diminished local tracking capabilities could create a false sense of security regarding food safety.
