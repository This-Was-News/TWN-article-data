## Article summary
Lawyers are questioning the legality of President Trump's deals with major law firms, suggesting they resemble agreements made "with a gun to the head." Trump has pressured certain firms, stripping them of security clearances while promoting deals with others, purportedly worth about $1 billion in pro bono services. Legal experts argue that these arrangements lack a true meeting of the minds, raising concerns about their enforceability. Some firms that settled with Trump have faced criticism and potential legal risks, including allegations of violating federal bribery statutes. Meanwhile, firms challenging Trump's actions have found success in court, highlighting the judiciary's independence. The culture within some firms has shifted towards a more mercenary approach, with partners expressing fears over the security of their agreements. Critics, including lawmakers, are pushing for clarity on these deals, which they argue could undermine the integrity of the legal profession. The State Bar of California has warned that Trump's orders threaten the rule of law and access to competent legal counsel. The White House maintains that these deals aim to hold Big Law accountable and utilize their influence positively. Ultimately, legal experts caution that the decisions made in this context could have lasting implications for both the firms involved and the broader legal landscape.
