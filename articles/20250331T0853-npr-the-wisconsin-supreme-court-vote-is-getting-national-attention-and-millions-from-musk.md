## Article summary
The Wisconsin Supreme Court election is drawing significant national attention and substantial financial backing, particularly from Elon Musk, who has contributed millions to support the conservative candidate, Brad Schimel. This election is pivotal as it could influence key issues such as abortion rights, voting regulations, and labor union powers, with potential implications for congressional redistricting. The race has become the most expensive state judicial election in U.S. history, with overall spending expected to reach $100 million.

Schimel, a former attorney general endorsed by Trump, faces off against Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge endorsed by Obama. Both candidates are vying for a seat that could shift the court's balance, as it currently leans liberal. Musk's involvement includes not only financial contributions but also controversial campaign tactics, including misleading ads and cash incentives for petition signers against "activist judges."

Crawford's campaign highlights Musk's attempts to influence the election, while Schimel insists he will uphold the law impartially. The election serves as a measure of Trump's influence in the state and could reflect broader partisan dynamics following the recent presidential election. The outcome may also affect ongoing legal matters involving Musk's Tesla in Wisconsin.
