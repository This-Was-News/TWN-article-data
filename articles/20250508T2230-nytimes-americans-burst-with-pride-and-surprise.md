## Article summary
The election of Leo XIV, a Chicago-born cardinal, as the first American pope has sparked a mix of pride and surprise among Americans. Many are celebrating this historic moment as the U.S. approaches its 250th anniversary, with hopes that an American pope might foster better international relations. Chicagoans, in particular, are thrilled, with local figures expressing astonishment and joy over the selection of a native son. However, some Americans were unaware of the pope's candidacy until the announcement was made. 

Political activists from both sides are analyzing the pope's past statements and affiliations to gauge his political leanings. Liberals highlighted a critical post he made about a comment from Vice President JD Vance, while conservatives pointed to his voting record suggesting Republican ties. In contrast, some individuals, like retired accountant Rosario Gonzales, expressed that nationality is irrelevant, focusing instead on the pope's role as a spiritual leader. Overall, reactions range from enthusiastic support to cautious curiosity, reflecting the diverse opinions surrounding this significant event.
