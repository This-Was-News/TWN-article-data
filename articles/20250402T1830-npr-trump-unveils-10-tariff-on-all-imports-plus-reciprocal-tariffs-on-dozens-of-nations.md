## Article summary
President Trump has announced a significant change in U.S. trade policy with the introduction of a 10% tariff on all imports, effective April 5, 2025, along with reciprocal tariffs that could reach as high as 49% for specific countries. Targeted nations include China, which will face a 34% tariff, the European Union with a 20% tariff, and Japan at 24%. This initiative, branded as "Liberation Day," aims to address what Trump describes as unfair trade practices that have harmed American workers and industries. 

While the administration argues that these tariffs will generate revenue for tax cuts and reduce the deficit, economists predict that U.S. consumers will ultimately bear the cost through higher prices. The tariffs are expected to escalate tensions in international trade, potentially triggering retaliatory measures from affected countries, including Canada and the EU. 

This policy builds on Trump's previous tariffs on steel, aluminum, and various goods from China and Mexico. Critics warn that the tariffs could lead to increased costs for American manufacturers reliant on imported materials and may contribute to a recession. Consumer confidence has already been shaken, hitting a 12-year low, as people anticipate rising prices due to these tariffs. Overall, the new tariffs represent a bold attempt to reshape U.S. trade relations, despite the potential economic repercussions.
