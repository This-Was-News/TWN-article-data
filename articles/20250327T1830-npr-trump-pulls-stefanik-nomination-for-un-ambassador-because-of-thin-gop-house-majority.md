## Article summary
President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., for the position of U.N. ambassador, citing concerns about maintaining the thin Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Despite expectations that her nomination would easily pass the Senate, Trump emphasized the importance of retaining every Republican seat in Congress as part of his America First agenda. Currently, Republicans hold 218 seats, while Democrats have 213, with four seats vacant. Trump requested Stefanik to remain in Congress to support key legislative goals, including tax cuts and economic growth.

Stefanik, previously the highest-ranking woman in the Republican House leadership, was succeeded by Rep. Lisa McClain as conference chair after her nomination. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed intentions to invite her back to the leadership team. Stefanik has been a staunch defender of Trump and has drawn attention for her role in congressional hearings. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the withdrawal, suggesting it reflects Republican vulnerability in potential special elections.
