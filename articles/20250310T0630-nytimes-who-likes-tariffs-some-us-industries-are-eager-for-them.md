## Article summary
The article discusses the mixed reactions to tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in the U.S. Some industries, particularly steel and aluminum manufacturers, support the tariffs as a means to combat unfair competition from foreign rivals who benefit from government subsidies. Executives like Stephen Capone, president of Capone Iron Corporation, argue that tariffs are necessary to protect local businesses from being underbid by cheaper Canadian imports. However, other companies, including major players like Ford Motors, express concern that these tariffs could lead to increased costs and retaliatory measures from other countries, ultimately harming the U.S. economy.

President Trump is reinstating tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico, which were previously exempted under a trade agreement. Supporters of the tariffs believe they will spur investment in U.S. manufacturing, while critics warn they could inflate prices for consumers. The aluminum industry is particularly divided, as many companies have operations in Canada that would be affected. Unions support the tariffs but urge the administration to differentiate between fair trade partners and those engaging in unfair practices. The overall impact of these tariffs on capacity expansion and market dynamics remains uncertain.
