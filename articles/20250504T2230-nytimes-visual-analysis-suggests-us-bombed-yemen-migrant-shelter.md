## Article summary
The video analysis indicates that a U.S. airstrike likely targeted a migrant detention center in Saada, Yemen, on April 28, resulting in the deaths of at least 68 African migrants, as reported by the Houthi militant group. The analysis identified remnants of three U.S.-made GBU-39 bombs at the site. While the U.S. acknowledged awareness of the strike and civilian casualties, it has not confirmed its involvement. The attack destroyed a 4,800-square-foot building, which the Houthis claimed housed 115 migrants. Experts noted that the scale of destruction suggested multiple munitions were used, consistent with the characteristics of GBU-39 bombs. The U.S. has conducted a bombing campaign against the Houthis since mid-March, aimed at curbing their attacks on Israel and shipping vessels in the Red Sea. The situation in Yemen remains complicated, with the Houthis controlling information and restricting independent reporting. Previous airstrikes on the same detention center had resulted in significant casualties, indicating a pattern of targeting. A U.S. defense official stated that they are investigating the claims of civilian casualties related to the incident.
