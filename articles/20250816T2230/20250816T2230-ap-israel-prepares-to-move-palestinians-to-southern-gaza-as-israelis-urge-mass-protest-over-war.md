## Article summary
Israel plans to relocate Palestinians from combat zones to southern Gaza as military operations intensify. The Israeli military announced the resumption of tent supplies to Gaza and ongoing discussions for a major offensive. Meanwhile, families of Israeli hostages are calling for a nationwide protest on Sunday, expressing frustration over the prolonged war and the recent release of videos showing emaciated hostages. The families fear the upcoming offensive will further endanger the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza, with only 20 believed to be alive. An Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed a baby girl and her parents, highlighting the civilian toll of the conflict. The United Nations warns of severe malnutrition and starvation in Gaza, with 11 more deaths reported in the past 24 hours. The U.S. has halted visitor visas for people from Gaza pending a review. The war has resulted in over 61,000 deaths in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, with half being women and children. The U.N. considers these figures the most reliable, though Israel disputes them.
