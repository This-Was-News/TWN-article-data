## Article summary
Electricity prices in the U.S. are rising more than twice as fast as inflation, causing significant financial strain, especially during the hot summer months when air conditioning usage peaks. Ken Thomas, a retiree in Boca Raton, Florida, faces monthly electric bills exceeding $400 despite investing in energy-efficient windows and insulation. Similarly, Al Salv, a senior in Pembroke Pines, struggles with bills reaching $500, forcing tough choices between paying for electricity or medication. Florida Power & Light proposed a rate increase, which was met with opposition from AARP, leading to a tentative agreement with commercial and industrial customers. Nationwide, factors like the rise of power-hungry AI data centers and increased natural gas exports are driving up electricity costs. Data centers are projected to consume more electricity than households for the first time next year, challenging policymakers to balance demand and costs. Natural gas, used in over 40% of electricity generation, has seen a 40% price increase in the first half of the year, with another 17% expected next year. While solar and wind energy can be cheaper, building new infrastructure poses financial challenges, particularly for low-income households already struggling with current bills. The federal government's assistance for low-income families is insufficient, and proposed budget cuts threaten to exacerbate the situation. Despite the financial burden, residents like Ken Thomas recognize the necessity of utilities but worry about affordability.
