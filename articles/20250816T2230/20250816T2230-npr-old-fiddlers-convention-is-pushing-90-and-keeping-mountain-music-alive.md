## Article summary
The Old Fiddler's Convention, celebrating its 89th year, is the oldest continuous Bluegrass and 'Old Time' music festival in the U.S., held annually in Galax, Virginia. The event attracts about 30,000 musicians, singers, and fans, featuring competitions in various categories like folk songs, bluegrass bands, and flatfoot dancing. Performers like 13-year-old Elle Massey travel long distances to participate, showcasing their love for traditional music. The convention also serves as a cultural melting pot, blending musical traditions from different cultures, including European, African, and Native American influences. Despite challenges like lower attendance post-pandemic and competition from other festivals, the convention remains a vital hub for preserving and promoting Old Time and Bluegrass music. The event is run by the local Moose Lodge and includes a youth competition to nurture young talent. Beyond the stage, the festival is a large musical tailgate with jamming sessions under tents and among RVs, highlighting the community's passion for keeping the music alive.
