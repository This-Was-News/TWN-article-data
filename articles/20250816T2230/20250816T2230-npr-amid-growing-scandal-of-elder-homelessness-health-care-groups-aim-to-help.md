## Article summary
The article highlights the growing issue of elder homelessness in the U.S., focusing on Roberta Rabnovitz, an 82-year-old who found housing through the PACE Organization of Rhode Island. PACE, a healthcare nonprofit funded by Medicare and Medicaid, aims to keep frail elderly individuals in their homes but is increasingly involved in securing housing due to rising costs. The article notes that 1 in 5 homeless individuals in 2024 were 55 or older, with the elderly homeless population rising by 6%. Factors like economic instability, health issues, and lack of affordable housing contribute to this crisis. PACE organizations are partnering with housing providers and even building their own housing to address the problem. Despite federal budget cuts to Medicaid, PACE's bipartisan support continues due to its cost-effectiveness compared to nursing home care. The article also mentions specific PACE initiatives in Michigan and California, showcasing their efforts to provide comprehensive care and stable housing for elderly participants.
