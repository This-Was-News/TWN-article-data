## Article summary
New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted on charges of conspiracy, fraud, and obstruction, allegedly concealing a romantic relationship with her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappe, using city funds. Prosecutors allege that Vappe was paid for work he did not perform while he and Cantrell were alone in apartments and visiting vineyards. They communicated via encrypted WhatsApp messages, which they later deleted. Cantrell has denied the allegations, claiming their relationship was strictly professional. The indictment details their travels to Scotland, Martha's Vineyard, and California, all paid for by New Orleans taxpayers. Cantrell's tenure has been marked by controversies, including criticism for her travel expenses and her handling of post-Hurricane Ida recovery. She survived a recall campaign in 2022 but faces significant legal challenges. The indictment is part of a broader pattern of public corruption in New Orleans, including past convictions of former officials like Mayor Ray Nagin. Cantrell's case highlights ongoing issues of corruption and accountability in the city's government.
