## Article summary
President Trump initially aimed to secure a cease-fire in Ukraine during talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin but left Alaska without one, despite declaring his happiness with the meeting. He abandoned the immediate cease-fire goal, aligning with Putin's approach of negotiating a broader peace deal that may require Ukraine to cede territory. This effectively allows Putin to continue the war without consequences while lengthy negotiations proceed. Critics argue Trump was manipulated by Putin, with former NATO ambassador Ivo Daalder calling it a sad spectacle. Trump's allies, like Senator Lindsey Graham, expressed optimism about ending the war through a three-way meeting with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The meeting in Anchorage marked a significant reversal of Trump's stated objectives, highlighting the shifting dynamics of the conflict.
