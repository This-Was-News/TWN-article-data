## Article summary
President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Anchorage for their first face-to-face meeting since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The closed-door session ended without a cease-fire agreement or any specific progress announced. Both leaders hinted at making headway but provided no clarity on the issues discussed or areas of agreement. Putin secured victories before and after the summit, returning to U.S. soil after years of ostracization and leaving without making major concessions. Trump showed deference to Putin, allowing him to speak first and unchallenged. Trump also walked back his previous demand for an immediate cease-fire. The meeting gave Trump an opportunity to denounce the investigation into his campaign's alleged conspiracy with Russians in 2016. Trump appeared open to visiting Russia, raising the possibility of a future meeting in Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has the most at stake, was not invited to the summit and remains in a debilitating war with Russia without robust U.S. military support assurances. The war continues as Moscow shows no signs of preparing to end it.
