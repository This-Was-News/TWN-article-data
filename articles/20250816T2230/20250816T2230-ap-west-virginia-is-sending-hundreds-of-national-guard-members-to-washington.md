## Article summary
West Virginia is deploying 300 to 400 National Guard members to Washington, D.C., as part of President Donald Trump's administration efforts to overhaul policing and address crime and homelessness. This move follows Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 D.C. National Guard members. Protesters have gathered in opposition to the federal takeover, marching from Dupont Circle to the White House with signs denouncing the military presence. Critics argue that crime rates are lower than during Trump's first term, questioning the necessity of the crackdown. Governor Patrick Morrissy of West Virginia expressed support for Trump's initiative, stating that the state is proud to assist in restoring pride and beauty to the nation's capital. Federal agents have been deployed in high-traffic neighborhoods, receiving mixed reactions from residents and leaders. Local officials, obligated to cooperate under federal laws, have sought to work with the administration while expressing concerns about the scope of the takeover. The administration recently reversed an order to place the DEA head as an emergency police commissioner after legal challenges. Mayor Muriel Bowser urged residents to unite in defending democratic principles despite the federal intervention.
