## Article summary
A summit in Alaska between President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump saw Putin gain significant diplomatic ground, with Trump praising their relationship and echoing the Kremlin's stance on pursuing a full peace agreement rather than a ceasefire in Ukraine. The summit, Putin's first to the U.S. in a decade and first to a Western country since invading Ukraine in 2022, was seen as a major diplomatic victory for Putin, who avoided pressure to end the war. Trump abandoned the idea of a ceasefire, aligning with the Kremlin's position, and did not mention the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Putin. The summit contrasted sharply with Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was treated as a representative of a rogue state. Putin's main goal of stalling pressure on Russia was achieved, while Trump shifted responsibility for peace efforts to Kyiv and Europe. Despite threats of severe consequences, Trump did not impose additional sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued advancing in Ukraine, with no signs of stopping unless Putin is convinced of military defeat.
