## Article summary
Teenagers in Washington, D.C., express feeling unsafe due to the federal police takeover. Marek Deca, an 18-year-old college student, feels nervous about federal forces patrolling near Howard University's campus. The federal takeover began after President Trump deployed the National Guard and took control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. D.C. officials sued the federal government, calling Trump's actions a hostile takeover. The Attorney General for the district argued that Trump's actions were unlawful, and the Justice Department withdrew its bid to name an 'emergency police chief.' Teenagers in the district, including Kenneth, Al, and Makayla, feel unsafe due to the federal takeover rather than the crime in the district. Kristen Henning, director of the Juvenile Justice Clinic and Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center, argues that punishing all black youth for the mistakes of a few is not necessary. The young people involved in D.C.'s juvenile justice system are disproportionately black boys. Henning has received worried phone calls from youth, including a girl who was handcuffed because she matched a description of someone else. Research shows that treating violent crime as a public health problem and addressing root causes like housing, food insecurity, unemployment, and mental health is effective in lowering crime rates. Tyela, a 17-year-old high school senior, argues that people in her neighborhood need better mental health care, better housing, and more recreation centers to reduce crime. She feels that Trump's police takeover will not solve the problem of crime in her neighborhood and is afraid to protest the action.
