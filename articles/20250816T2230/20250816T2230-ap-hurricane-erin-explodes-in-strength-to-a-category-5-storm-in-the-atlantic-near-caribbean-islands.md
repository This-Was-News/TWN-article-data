## Article summary
Erin strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane in the Caribbean early Saturday and is expected to further intensify. The storm, currently 170 miles northeast of Anguilla with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, is moving west-northwest at 20 mph. While it is not forecast to hit land, strong winds are affecting nearby islands, raising concerns about flooding and landslides. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) predicts Erin could become a Category 4 storm later Saturday but is expected to veer away from the continental United States. Tropical storm watches are in place for St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, and St. Maarten, with up to 4 inches of rain expected. Hurricane specialist Michael Lowry forecasts Erin to turn northeast, potentially impacting Bermuda. Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the first to reach hurricane status. It is forecast to become a powerful Category 4 hurricane due to warm ocean waters. The season is expected to be unusually busy, with forecasts calling for six to ten hurricanes, three to five of which could reach major status. The U.S. government has deployed over 200 employees to Puerto Rico as a precaution, and the U.S. Coast Guard has closed several seaports. Officials in the Bahamas are also preparing shelters and urging residents to monitor the storm's path.
