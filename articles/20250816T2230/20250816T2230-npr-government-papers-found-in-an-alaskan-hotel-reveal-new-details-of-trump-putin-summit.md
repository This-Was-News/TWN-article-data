## Article summary
Government papers found in an Alaskan hotel reveal new details about the August 15, 2025, summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The documents, marked with U.S. State Department markings, were accidentally left in a public printer at the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage. They included sensitive information such as meeting locations, times, and phone numbers of U.S. government employees. The papers detailed the sequence of meetings, including a ceremonial gift Trump intended to give Putin. The White House dismissed the papers as a lunch menu, downplaying the security breach. The documents also listed names and phone numbers of U.S. staff and state leaders, along with a seating chart for a luncheon honoring Putin. The luncheon, which was later canceled, was intended to be a three-course meal. Legal experts criticized the incident as evidence of professional negligence. This breach is part of a series of security lapses by officials in the Trump administration.
