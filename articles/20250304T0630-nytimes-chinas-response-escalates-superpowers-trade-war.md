## Article summary
China has retaliated against President Trump's tariffs by imposing its own tariffs on American food imports and blacklisting 15 U.S. companies from purchasing Chinese products without special permission. The Chinese Ministry of Finance announced a 15% tariff on imports of American chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, along with a 10% tariff on other food items. This response follows Trump's imposition of nearly 20% tariffs on all Chinese goods, which he argues is necessary to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. However, Chinese officials claim that these tariffs violate World Trade Organization rules and disrupt global supply chains.

China's targeting of American food imports mirrors its previous strategies during earlier trade disputes, where it imposed tariffs on soybeans in 2018. Despite these retaliatory measures, the impact on U.S. politics has been minimal, as demonstrated in past elections where voters did not significantly penalize Trump or the Republican Party for trade issues. Additionally, China has begun restricting exports of critical minerals to the U.S., further escalating tensions.

While China aims to strengthen trade relations with Europe in response to U.S. tariffs, it faces its own economic challenges, including attracting foreign investment and recovering from a real estate slowdown. Trump's aggressive tariff strategy has raised the average tariff on Chinese imports significantly, complicating trade relations further. The ongoing trade conflict reflects deeper issues in U.S.-China relations, with both sides signaling a need for negotiation rather than unilateral actions.
