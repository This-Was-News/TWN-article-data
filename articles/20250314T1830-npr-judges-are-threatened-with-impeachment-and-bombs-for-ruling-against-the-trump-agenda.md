## Article summary
Judges who have ruled against the Trump administration are facing unprecedented threats, including impeachment proposals and bomb threats, which jeopardize their safety and the independence of the judiciary. Recent incidents include a bomb threat directed at the sister of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and social media attacks on lower court judges. Experts warn that these threats come at an early stage in legal proceedings, undermining the justice system's integrity. Historically, only a few federal judges have faced impeachment, primarily for serious wrongdoing, making current threats particularly alarming. The Federal Judges Association emphasizes the necessity for judges to perform their duties without fear of violence or intimidation. Moreover, judges have reported a doubling in threats against them in recent years, affecting both Democratic and Republican appointees. Concerns are raised about the potential for judges' security to be compromised based on their rulings, with calls for an independent security force for judges. The situation reflects a troubling trend towards normalizing attacks on judicial independence, raising fears for the rule of law in the United States.
