## Article summary
A federal judge, Susan Illston, has extended an order blocking President Trump's plans for mass layoffs affecting tens of thousands of federal employees across 22 agencies, including Housing, State, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. The judge ruled that the Trump administration failed to follow legal procedures set by Congress for such reductions. The order prevents the administration from shutting down offices or moving programs while the case is under consideration. The government has sought to overturn this ruling, arguing it hinders the executive branch's ability to implement downsizing plans. The lawsuit, supported by unions, claims the president lacks the authority to reorganize the federal workforce independently. Judge Illston's ruling also addresses the status of employees already placed on administrative leave or terminated, calling for their reinstatement while maintaining their paid status during the lawsuit. She expressed concern over the impact of ongoing litigation on affected employees. The case could have significant implications for future federal workforce changes. The administration's approach is under scrutiny as it attempts to reshape the government.
