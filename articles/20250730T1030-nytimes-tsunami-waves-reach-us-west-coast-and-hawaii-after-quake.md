## Article summary
An 8.8-magnitude earthquake near Russia triggered tsunami waves that reached Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast, with waves as high as 5.7 feet in Hawaii and 3.6 feet in California's Crescent City. Tsunami warnings were issued for Hawaii, Alaska, California, Russia, and Japan, prompting evacuations, but the worst fears did not materialize in Hawaii and Russia. The tsunami waves, moving at over 500 miles per hour, are not tall walls of water but sudden floods causing dangerous currents. Hawaii downgraded its tsunami warning to an advisory, with no major damage reported, while California continued to experience building waves. The tsunami also affected regions in Japan, French Polynesia, and other Pacific nations, with warnings issued for potential waves up to 13 feet in some areas.
