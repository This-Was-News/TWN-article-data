## Article summary
The Trump administration deported Salvadoran man Jordin Melgar-Salmeron shortly after a federal appeals court issued a stay on his removal. The government attributed this action to administrative errors, claiming the deportation process had begun before the court's order was issued. Melgar-Salmeron, who had previously been affiliated with the MS-13 gang, feared persecution upon return to El Salvador. His lawyer criticized the government's explanation, suggesting it reflected a broader pattern of ignoring court orders. This incident is part of a troubling trend, as federal judges have previously ruled against the Trump administration in similar deportation cases. Notably, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was also deported despite a judicial order protecting him, leading to ongoing legal battles. Other cases, such as that of a Venezuelan man named Cristian, have highlighted the administration's disregard for legal agreements regarding asylum seekers. Judges have expressed frustration over the administration's failure to comply with court directives, with some even contemplating holding officials in contempt. Recently, a federal judge ordered the return of another wrongfully deported immigrant, indicating ongoing legal scrutiny of the administration's practices.
