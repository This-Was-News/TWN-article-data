## Article summary
President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine in a highly anticipated phone call. Scheduled for Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern, this will be their second acknowledged conversation since Trump’s second term began. Trump expressed hope for a productive dialogue leading to a ceasefire, while Putin's spokesman acknowledged U.S. diplomatic efforts. Despite Trump's initial promise to swiftly end the conflict, he has faced challenges due to deep-rooted differences between Ukraine and Russia. Recent Russian drone strikes on Ukrainian civilians have drawn criticism from Trump, who previously urged Putin to halt such attacks. The call comes amid a series of diplomatic maneuvers, including a recent meeting in Istanbul where Russia and Ukraine discussed a significant prisoner exchange. Ukraine and its allies demand an unconditional ceasefire, while Putin insists on addressing the war's root causes first. Attention will be on whether this call leads to an in-person meeting, as Trump believes his negotiation skills could help resolve the conflict. The situation remains tense, with both sides asserting their positions.
