## Article summary
Texas officials and the National Weather Service (NWS) have differing views on the accuracy of forecasts leading up to a devastating flood that resulted in at least 78 fatalities. Despite early preparations and a flood watch issued by the NWS, many were caught off guard when the Guadalupe River rose dramatically due to heavy rain. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly stated that the severity of the flooding was unexpected, while NWS representatives maintained that they provided adequate warnings and updates as conditions evolved. Meteorologists highlighted the complexities of predicting such extreme weather events, noting that forecasts can be challenging and often do not capture the full severity of storms.

Criticism emerged from Texas officials regarding the initial rainfall predictions, which did not account for the extreme conditions that developed. Governor Greg Abbott acknowledged the warnings but pointed out a disconnect in public understanding of flash flooding risks. Experts suggested that the unusual weather system, occurring over a holiday weekend, contributed to the chaos. Some critics also raised concerns about the impact of recent job cuts at the NWS on forecasting capabilities, as the agency has lost nearly 600 employees. Calls for improved funding and research in weather forecasting were emphasized to prevent future tragedies.
