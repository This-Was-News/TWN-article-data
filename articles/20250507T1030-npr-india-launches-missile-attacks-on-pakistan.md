## Article summary
India has launched missile strikes on various locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled territory, marking a significant escalation in tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations. Dubbed "Operation Sindoor," the Indian military targeted nine sites believed to be involved in planning attacks against India. This action was a response to a recent militant attack in India-administered Kashmir that resulted in 26 fatalities. The situation has been tense since the April 22 attack, which India attributes to Pakistan. In reaction to the strikes, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India's actions as an act of war and pledged a strong response, asserting Pakistan's right to defend itself. The U.S. President expressed hope for a swift resolution to the ongoing conflict. The U.N. secretary-general called for both nations to exercise maximum military restraint, emphasizing the global implications of a potential war. This situation is still developing, with ongoing international concerns regarding the escalation.
