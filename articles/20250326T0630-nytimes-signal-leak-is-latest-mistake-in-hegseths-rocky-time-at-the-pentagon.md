## Article summary
The article discusses the turbulent tenure of Pete Hegseth as Defense Secretary, highlighting a significant mishap involving the accidental disclosure of U.S. military plans for Yemen on a chat app. This incident raised concerns about the safety of American troops and marked a rocky start to Hegseth's leadership at the Pentagon. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, aimed to align closely with President Trump’s controversial stances, including plans to diminish NATO's role and enforce a ban on transgender troops. His attempts to outpace Trump often backfired, leading to criticism from both Congress and military personnel.

The Signal leak, which included sensitive information shared in a group chat that inadvertently involved a journalist, drew widespread outrage within military circles. Although Hegseth denied divulging war plans, his actions have prompted calls for accountability and investigations. His earlier comments on Ukraine also sparked backlash, as they contradicted both NATO expectations and Trump's later statements. Additionally, Hegseth's administration faced scrutiny for its stance against diversity initiatives within the military. Overall, the article portrays Hegseth's leadership as marked by missteps and a struggle to navigate the complexities of his position.
