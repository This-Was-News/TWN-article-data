## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced a new initiative to prioritize denaturalization cases, particularly targeting naturalized citizens who commit certain crimes. A memo from June outlines that attorneys are directed to pursue denaturalization more aggressively, especially in cases involving national security violations and fraud against the government. This move is seen as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape immigration policies and redefine citizenship rights. Critics, including legal experts, express concerns about the constitutionality of these actions and their potential impact on families of naturalized citizens, particularly children who could lose their citizenship if a parent's status is revoked. The recent case of Elliott Duke, a military veteran who was denaturalized after committing child sexual abuse, illustrates the administration's renewed focus on stripping citizenship. The DOJ's approach allows for civil litigation in denaturalization cases, which raises due process issues since individuals are not entitled to legal representation. Some experts argue that this creates a second-class status for naturalized citizens, while supporters claim it protects national interests. The initiative echoes historical practices from the McCarthy era and has been expanded since the Obama administration. Overall, the DOJ's intensified efforts signal a significant shift in how citizenship is viewed and enforced in the U.S.
