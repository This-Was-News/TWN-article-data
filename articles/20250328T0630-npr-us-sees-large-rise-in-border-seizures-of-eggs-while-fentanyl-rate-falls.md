## Article summary
Recent reports indicate a significant increase in border seizures of eggs in the U.S., with a 48% rise in interceptions compared to last year. This surge is attributed to soaring egg prices driven by a bird flu outbreak affecting the poultry industry, which has led to the culling of over 168 million birds since early 2022. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) noted a particularly sharp increase in egg interceptions, especially in the San Diego Field Office, where seizures rose by 158%. In contrast, fentanyl seizures have declined, with only 63 cases reported in February, marking the lowest levels in three years. The decrease in fentanyl interceptions comes amid a broader decline in drug overdose deaths linked to the substance. The U.S. Agriculture Department is attempting to address the egg shortage by negotiating imports from countries like Turkey and South Korea, aiming to stabilize prices. The combination of high demand and limited supply has prompted many to attempt smuggling eggs into the country. CBP has recorded 5,572 egg product seizures so far this fiscal year, reflecting a broader trend since the onset of the avian flu outbreak. The situation underscores the complexities of border control and agricultural policy amid fluctuating market conditions.
