## Article summary
Europe agreed to a trade deal with the Trump administration to avoid escalating a trade war and to maintain diplomatic ties with the United States, which is seen as a crucial peace broker. The deal centers on a 15% tariff on most goods imported from the European Union to the United States. European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, Friedrich Merz, and Emmanuel Macron, prioritized stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The agreement is seen as a way to keep the U.S. engaged in global issues like the Iranian nuclear program, the Gaza conflict, and the war in Ukraine. While the deal may not significantly boost the European economy, it is considered better than the potential alternatives.
