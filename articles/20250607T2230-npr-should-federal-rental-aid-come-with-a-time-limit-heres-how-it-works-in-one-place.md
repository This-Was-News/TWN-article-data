## Article summary
The article discusses the impact of federal rental aid with a time limit, focusing on Becca Morris, who benefited from a seven-year housing subsidy in Delaware. Morris applied for the aid during a tumultuous period in her life, and she describes the time limit as "good pressure" that motivated her to improve her situation. The Delaware program differs from many others by allowing participants to save money without increasing their rent as their income rises, contributing to their financial stability. Despite the time limit, Morris received extensions due to the COVID pandemic and personal circumstances, which aided her in completing her nursing degree. 

The article highlights that only a small number of housing authorities can impose such time limits, and while some argue they encourage turnover and mobility, evidence suggests they may not effectively boost employment or income levels. Critics point to failed implementations in places like Tacoma, Washington, where time limits led to increased homelessness rather than progress. The success of the Delaware program is attributed not just to the time limit but also to additional support services and savings accounts. Ultimately, Morris is preparing to move into her own home, reflecting on her journey toward greater independence.
