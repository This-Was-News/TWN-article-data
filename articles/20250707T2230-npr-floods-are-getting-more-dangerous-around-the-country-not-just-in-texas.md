## Article summary
The recent flash floods in Texas, exacerbated by climate change, highlight the increasing danger of severe weather across the U.S. On July 4, 2025, South Central Texas experienced up to 12 inches of rain, leading to rapid and dangerous flooding in an area known as Flash Flood Alley. Climate change contributes to more intense rainstorms, with the heaviest downpours in Texas now dropping about 20% more rain than in the late 1950s. As the planet warms, tropical storms are also becoming more potent, causing significant inland flooding, as seen with past storms like Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Ida.

Despite the growing flood risks, many communities are not updating their flood infrastructure to reflect the increased rainfall intensity, relying instead on outdated historical data. In Harris County, Texas, updated rainfall records revealed that extreme storms now drop nearly 18 inches of rain, making significant portions of major roads vulnerable to flooding. The county's flood infrastructure plan has become considerably more expensive due to these new safety requirements. NOAA is working to update rainfall records nationwide, but there are concerns about potential delays due to budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration. Overall, the document underscores the urgent need for communities to adapt to the realities of climate change and its impact on flooding.
