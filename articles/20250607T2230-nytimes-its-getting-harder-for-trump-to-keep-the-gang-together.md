## Article summary
The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk has soured, indicating difficulties in maintaining Trump's diverse populist conservative coalition. Initially, Trump's coalition appeared strong, with broad public support for his conservative agenda. However, indicators show that this coalition is beginning to fray, particularly among young and nonwhite voters who now disapprove of Trump's performance. The ideological diversity within his support base, which includes anti-woke and anti-establishment elites, complicates Trump's ability to satisfy all factions. Musk's departure, while potentially personal, highlights the challenges Trump faces in reconciling differing priorities among his supporters.

Moreover, the national debt is becoming a significant political issue, complicating the passage of tax and spending bills. High deficits and interest payments are straining the ability of Republicans to promise tax cuts while maintaining popular entitlement programs. This fiscal burden could also impact Democrats, who have relied on deficit spending to unify their party. As the national debt becomes a more pressing concern for voters, it could lead to major political shifts, reminiscent of historical changes in coalitions. Overall, Trump's coalition faces significant challenges that could reshape the political landscape.
