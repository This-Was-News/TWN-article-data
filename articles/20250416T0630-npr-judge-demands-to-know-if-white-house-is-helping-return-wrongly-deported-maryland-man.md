## Article summary
A Maryland federal judge is investigating whether the White House is taking adequate steps to facilitate the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis has initiated an expedited discovery process, allowing for questioning of government officials under oath to determine if they are acting in "bad faith." Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland for 15 years and had protections from a U.S. immigration judge, is currently detained in a notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT. The Supreme Court has mandated that the federal government must assist in his return, emphasizing that every day he remains in custody causes irreparable harm. 

The U.S. government has accused him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyers dispute, asserting he has no criminal record. There is contention over whether the U.S. government has actively requested his release from Salvadoran authorities. During a recent Oval Office meeting, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele stated he would not "smuggle a terrorist" into the U.S., complicating the situation further. The judge has expressed frustration with the government’s responses, indicating they do not adequately address whether proper actions are being taken for Abrego Garcia’s case. The White House maintains it is complying with court orders and acting within legal boundaries. The case highlights significant issues surrounding immigration enforcement and the treatment of deportees.
