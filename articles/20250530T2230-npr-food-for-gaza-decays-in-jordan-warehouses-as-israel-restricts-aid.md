## Article summary
Food aid intended for Gaza is deteriorating in Jordanian warehouses due to Israel's restrictions on aid entry since March. The UNRWA has tens of thousands of boxes of food, including flour and chickpeas, that are nearing expiration, with some expected to be discarded. While the U.S. established Jordan as a humanitarian aid hub, Israel has recently limited aid deliveries to only a few locations in southern Gaza, barring supplies from Jordan and Egypt. This has left humanitarian goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars stranded at border crossings, with aid organizations incurring storage fees. Israel alleges that Hamas has been diverting aid, but U.N. officials state there is no evidence to support this claim. The newly formed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has faced criticism for its operations, and its first head resigned, citing a failure to adhere to humanitarian principles. Aid distribution has plummeted dramatically, with organizations able to deliver only a fraction of the needed meals daily. Medical supplies are also critically low, with essential items like antiseptics and gauze being rationed. The Israeli military agency overseeing the border has not provided clarity on the restrictions, while U.S. officials have denied that aid from Jordan and Egypt is being barred.
