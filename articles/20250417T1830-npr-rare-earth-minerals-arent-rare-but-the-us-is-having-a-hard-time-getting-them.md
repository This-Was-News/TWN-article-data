## Article summary
Rare earth minerals, despite their name, are not rare and are essential for U.S. defense and technology applications. The U.S. is currently facing challenges in securing these minerals due to China's dominance in the market, as it controls about 60% of global supply and processes nearly all heavy rare earths. In response to U.S. tariffs, China has begun restricting exports, raising concerns over supply chain security for critical technologies, including electronics and military equipment. Gracelin Baskaran from the Center for Strategic and International Studies highlights that these minerals are crucial for defense technologies, with significant quantities used in advanced military systems like the F-35 fighter jet.

Although the U.S. is investing in domestic production capabilities, it is lagging behind and cannot quickly ramp up operations. Current stockpiles may provide temporary relief, but prolonged restrictions from China could disrupt both military and civilian applications, such as medical diagnostic equipment. The situation presents a powerful negotiating tool for China, forcing the U.S. to consider the implications of its tariff policies on national security and economic competitiveness. Ultimately, the U.S. must navigate the delicate balance between maintaining tariffs and ensuring access to these vital minerals.
