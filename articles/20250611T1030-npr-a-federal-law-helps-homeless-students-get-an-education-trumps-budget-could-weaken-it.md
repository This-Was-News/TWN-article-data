## Article summary
The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act provides vital support for homeless students, including funding for education-related resources. However, the Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 threatens to weaken this support by consolidating the McKinney-Vento program with 17 others and significantly reducing overall funding. Critics argue that this change would deprive schools of essential resources, ultimately harming homeless students who rely on dedicated funding for identification and support. Experts warn that without mandated protections, schools may prioritize other needs over those of homeless students, leading to reduced protections and services. Approximately 1.4 million students experienced homelessness in the 2022-23 school year, and the proposed cuts could exacerbate their challenges, including higher dropout rates and chronic absenteeism. Advocates emphasize that identification is crucial for providing necessary supports, and without federal backing, the effectiveness of McKinney-Vento would diminish. The future remains uncertain for those working directly with homeless families, as funding decisions are pending congressional approval. Overall, the proposal has raised significant concerns about the welfare of homeless students and the sustainability of critical educational programs.
