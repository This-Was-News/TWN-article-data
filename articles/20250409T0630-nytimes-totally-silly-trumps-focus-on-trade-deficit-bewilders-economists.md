## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's ambitious goal of eliminating the bilateral trade deficit with every U.S. trading partner through the implementation of steep tariffs on nearly 60 nations. Economists criticize this focus on trade deficits as a flawed metric for evaluating trade relationships, arguing that it overlooks the complexities behind trade flows and is misleading. While some economists acknowledge that the overall U.S. trade deficit may pose economic issues due to reliance on foreign manufacturing, they contend that bilateral deficits do not accurately reflect trade practices. The article highlights that trade surpluses and deficits often arise from natural trade patterns rather than unfair practices, as seen in the U.S. surplus with Australia or the Netherlands. Critics also point out that Trump's tariff formula indiscriminately targets all foreign trade, affecting even close allies. Analysts suggest that the tariffs may not effectively address the underlying issues driving trade imbalances, as they primarily focus on bilateral deficits rather than the broader economic policies of trading partners. Some economists argue that the U.S. trade deficit is influenced more by domestic factors, such as government spending, rather than demand for imported goods. Ultimately, the article concludes that without significant changes in foreign economic policies, the U.S. trade issues are unlikely to be resolved through tariffs alone.
