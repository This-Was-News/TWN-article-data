## Article summary
Karen Read was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges in a Massachusetts court regarding the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, who died in January 2022. Prosecutors alleged that Read intentionally struck O'Keefe with her SUV after an argument and left him in a blizzard, but the jury ultimately found her not guilty. They did convict her on a lesser charge of operating a vehicle under the influence. The case, which had previously ended in a mistrial, garnered significant public attention, fueled by true-crime enthusiasts and conspiracy theories surrounding the investigation. Read's defense argued that O'Keefe was killed at a party hosted by another officer and claimed that investigators covered up the truth to frame her. Testimony during the retrial included evidence about the vehicle's taillight and O'Keefe's cellphone data. Despite the prosecution's arguments, the defense raised reasonable doubts about the evidence and alleged misconduct in the investigation. Following the verdict, Read expressed gratitude to her supporters, while some attendees of the party lamented the outcome as a miscarriage of justice. Legal experts noted problems with the prosecution's evidence, contributing to the jury's decision to acquit.
