## Article summary
The enforcement of the federal REAL ID law begins on May 7, 2025, requiring travelers to present compliant identification to board domestic flights and access certain federal facilities. Standard driver's licenses and state IDs will no longer be accepted at airport security checkpoints. REAL IDs, which feature a golden star and require more documentation, aim to standardize state IDs for security purposes. While the law was enacted post-9/11, concerns about unreliable IDs date back to incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing. States have varied in their implementation of the law, with challenges for noncitizens and those without legal status in obtaining REAL IDs.

Travelers without a REAL ID are advised not to panic, as there is a two-year "wiggle room" period allowing for additional screening instead of outright denial. However, delays are expected once the policy is enforced. Acceptable alternatives to REAL ID include passports, passport cards, Global Entry, and enhanced driver's licenses from certain states. Additionally, flying from smaller airports may ease the transition, as they may have less congestion and simpler processes. For a complete list of accepted IDs, travelers can refer to the TSA website.
