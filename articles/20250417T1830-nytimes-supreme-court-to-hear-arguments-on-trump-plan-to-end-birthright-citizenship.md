## Article summary
The Supreme Court will hear arguments regarding President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship, which guarantees automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. The court's decision to hold oral arguments on May 15 comes after the Trump administration sought to lift a nationwide pause imposed by lower courts. This executive order affects the citizenship status of children born to undocumented immigrants and foreign residents. Critics, including New Jersey's attorney general, argue the order is unconstitutional and undermines the 14th Amendment, which has historically protected birthright citizenship.

The Trump administration argues that lower courts have exceeded their authority with nationwide injunctions against such policies. Solicitor General D. John Sauer emphasized the need for the Supreme Court to restore the balance of powers in response to these injunctions. Legal representatives for the states challenging the order contend that the request for a stay is unfounded and does not constitute an emergency. The case reflects ongoing debates about immigration policy and the interpretation of constitutional rights. The outcome could have significant implications for citizenship laws in the United States.
