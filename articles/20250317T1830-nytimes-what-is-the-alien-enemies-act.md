## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants, particularly those linked to the gang Tren de Aragua. This law grants the president wartime powers to deport undocumented immigrants with minimal due process. Despite a federal judge's order blocking the deportations, the Trump administration proceeded to send 238 migrants to El Salvador, highlighting a significant conflict between the executive branch and the judiciary. The Alien Enemies Act has historically been used during wartime for the detention and expulsion of immigrants based on their nationality. Trump's executive order claims that members of Tren de Aragua pose a threat to the U.S., alleging their infiltration and hostile actions against the country. Legal experts question the validity of using this law against individuals not directly representing a foreign government. The administration's actions have raised concerns about a potential constitutional crisis, as they challenge judicial authority over foreign affairs. The fate of the deported migrants remains uncertain, with ongoing legal battles likely to shape future deportation strategies. The article emphasizes the implications of these actions on U.S. immigration policy and the balance of power between branches of government.
