## Article summary
The article reflects on the transformative impact of Donald Trump's political career as he enters the second decade since announcing his presidential campaign. It highlights how Trump has defined this era more significantly than any recent president, despite his unpopularity. His influence has permeated national discourse, with every major issue seemingly revolving around him, regardless of his time in office. Supporters view him as a necessary corrective to decades of liberal dominance, while critics argue he has normalized harmful ideologies and divisive rhetoric. The article notes that Trump's presidency has been marked by unprecedented actions, including dismantling government agencies and fostering a culture of grievance. It also discusses the increasingly coarse and violent nature of political discourse during his tenure, contrasting it with earlier presidencies. Despite controversies, Trump maintains a strong base, though questions remain about the future of his political era without him. The piece concludes by acknowledging the ongoing challenges and tests ahead in the Age of Trump.
