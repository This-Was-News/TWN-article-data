## Article summary
Despite claims of widespread noncitizen voting influencing the 2024 election, a review by the Michigan Secretary of State found only 16 credible cases out of 5.7 million votes cast. A new report by the Center for Election Innovation & Research (CEIR) confirms that noncitizen voting occurs in minuscule numbers and lacks coordination. Michigan's audit, using DHS resources, found that noncitizen voting is extremely rare, with only 0.00028% of votes cast by noncitizens. The report highlights disparities in how states investigate and disclose data on noncitizen voting, with some states inflating numbers for political purposes. Experts argue that noncitizen voting is not a significant threat due to safeguards, the risk of deportation, and the lack of evidence supporting widespread fraud.
