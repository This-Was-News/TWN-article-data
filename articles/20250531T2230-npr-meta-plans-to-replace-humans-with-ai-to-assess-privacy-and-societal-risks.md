## Article summary
Meta is transitioning to an automated system for assessing privacy and societal risks, with plans for up to 90% of risk assessments to be conducted by AI rather than human evaluators. This shift aims to expedite the release of updates and features for platforms like Instagram and Facebook, but raises concerns about the lack of thorough scrutiny on potential negative impacts. Former employees express fears that this automation could lead to higher risks, as engineers, who may not be privacy experts, are now empowered to make risk assessments. While Meta claims that human expertise will still be utilized for complex issues, internal documents suggest automation may extend to sensitive areas, including youth risk and content integrity. The company has been under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission since 2012 regarding user privacy, and the changes come amid a broader push to enhance efficiency in response to competition from other tech firms. Critics argue that speeding up risk assessments could be counterproductive, as prior scrutiny has often identified significant issues. Meta's chief privacy officer stated that the goal is to simplify decision-making while maintaining oversight. However, some insiders believe that removing human perspectives from risk assessments could be irresponsible. The changes also indicate a shift towards less restrictive content policies and faster updates, reflecting a new strategy under CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
