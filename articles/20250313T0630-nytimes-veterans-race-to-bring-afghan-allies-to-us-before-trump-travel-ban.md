## Article summary
The article discusses the implications of President Trump's travel ban on Afghan allies who assisted U.S. forces during the Afghanistan war. Following Trump's inauguration, efforts to relocate these individuals became urgent as a new executive order threatened to restrict their entry into the United States. Nonprofit organization No One Left Behind has mobilized to raise funds for flights and assistance, aiming to bring Afghan allies to safety before the potential ban takes effect. Many Afghans, including those with Special Immigrant Visas, have faced challenges due to funding cuts for refugee resettlement and the cancellation of supportive contracts, leaving them to fend for themselves financially. As a result, thousands remain stranded in countries like Pakistan, Albania, and Qatar, fearing retribution from the Taliban. Military veterans and advocacy groups are working tirelessly to expedite the relocation process, emphasizing the dire consequences of inaction. The article highlights personal stories, including that of Aman Jafari, who struggled to reach the U.S. with his family. Concerns have been raised by lawmakers regarding the impact of the executive orders on Afghan relocation efforts. Overall, the article underscores the urgent need to honor commitments to those who risked their lives for the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
