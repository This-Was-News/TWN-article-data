## Article summary
The Ukraine war, now three years since Russia's full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, continues to inflict severe civilian casualties and destruction. Ukrainians are eager for peace but refuse to accept terms that favor Russia, fearing such concessions would only lead to further conflict. Recent shifts in U.S. diplomacy under President Trump, who advocates for a quicker resolution, have raised concerns in Ukraine and among European allies, who feel sidelined. The U.S.-Russia talks, held in Saudi Arabia, mark a significant change from the previous administration's isolationist stance towards Moscow.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy faces challenges as Trump promotes narratives that undermine his leadership, complicating Ukraine's position in ongoing negotiations. Meanwhile, European leaders are advocating for a more significant role in peace talks, emphasizing their substantial wartime aid to Ukraine. The war has evolved into a protracted conflict, with both sides suffering heavy losses, and Russia currently occupies about 20% of Ukrainian territory. 

Negotiations for peace remain uncertain, with Trump's administration suggesting a mix of security guarantees and territorial concessions, while Russia's military gains might embolden its negotiating position. As the conflict continues, the need for a resolution becomes more pressing, with both sides facing internal and external pressures.
