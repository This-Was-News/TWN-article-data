## Article summary
The case of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national accused of a violent attack in Colorado, underscores the issue of visa overstays in the U.S. Soliman entered the country on a tourist visa in August 2022 but later applied for asylum, which led to a temporary work permit that has since expired. In fiscal year 2023, approximately 400,000 individuals overstayed their visas, with around 2,400 of those being Egyptians. Despite the significant number of visa overstays, political discourse often focuses on migrants crossing the southwestern border. Estimates indicate that over 40% of undocumented immigrants entered the U.S. legally before overstaying their visas. Immigration scholar Stephen Yale-Loehr notes that this group has been largely overlooked in discussions about immigration enforcement. Identifying and tracking visa overstays is challenging, and historically, enforcement has not prioritized these cases. Various visa categories, including those for students and tourists, can lead to overstays if individuals do not comply with the terms of their entry. Overall, the visibility of visa overstays is limited compared to illegal border crossings, contributing to the lack of attention on this issue.
