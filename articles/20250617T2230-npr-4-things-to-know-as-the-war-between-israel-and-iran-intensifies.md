## Article summary
The conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified, marked by Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian military and nuclear facilities. Civilians in Tehran are experiencing panic as they attempt to evacuate amidst warnings from Israel and a lack of government guidance on safety. The Israeli military has launched extensive attacks, claiming to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, while Iran retaliates with missile strikes against Israel, resulting in civilian casualties on both sides. Experts note that destroying Iran's underground nuclear sites poses significant challenges for Israel, and the Israeli government's endgame remains unclear, with Prime Minister Netanyahu stating the goal is to dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities rather than regime change. Meanwhile, the U.S. could potentially be drawn into the conflict, as Israel may require American support to effectively degrade Iran's nuclear program. Trump's administration has signaled a strong stance against Iranian nuclear ambitions, warning of military repercussions if Iran attacks U.S. forces. The situation remains volatile, with the potential for broader regional consequences and stalled diplomatic negotiations.
