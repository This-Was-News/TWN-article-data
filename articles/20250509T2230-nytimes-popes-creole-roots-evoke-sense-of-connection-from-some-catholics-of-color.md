## Article summary
Pope Leo XIV's ascension as the new head of the Catholic Church has sparked excitement among Catholics of color, particularly those in Africa, due to his Creole heritage. Rev. Lawrence Ndlovu from Johannesburg noted that Pope Leo's skin tone resonated with many, as they see him as relatable and potentially supportive of their causes. His ancestry includes ties to New Orleans and possibly the Caribbean, although there is some ambiguity regarding his racial background. Experts have traced aspects of his lineage to various locations, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Despite his family's identification, some individuals, like Robson Querino do Nascimento from Brazil, believe Pope Leo's roots will influence him to advocate for the marginalized. The pope's multicultural background has also brought relief to South Africans who feared a consolidation of American power under his leadership. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, some Catholics view Pope Leo as capable of representing African interests, a sentiment echoed by Father Léonard Santedi. Overall, there is hope that his diverse heritage will allow him to embrace and reflect global diversity within the Church.
