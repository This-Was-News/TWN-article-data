## Article summary
The Weather Service, led by Ken Graham, aimed to modernize its operations, but recent cuts mandated by the Department of Government Efficiency, influenced by Elon Musk, have severely impacted its workforce and capabilities. Nearly 600 employees have been laid off, jeopardizing crucial data collection and forecasting functions. The agency has faced skepticism about its efficiency and budget constraints, while Congress has historically debated the role of government forecasts amidst competition from private weather companies. As the Weather Service grapples with outdated technology and staffing shortages, concerns rise about the potential for catastrophic failures in its infrastructure by the 2030s. The agency's modernization efforts have been further complicated by the need for immediate staffing solutions and a focus on extreme weather forecasting. Critics worry that proposed commercialization of forecasting could limit access to vital public safety information. Recent storms have heightened calls for restoring lost positions, with some congressional members advocating for immediate action to ensure community safety. Despite challenges, a new agreement allows forecasters to prioritize extreme weather events, aiming to enhance efficiency amid ongoing turmoil.
