## Article summary
A federal judge in Washington, D.C. has ruled against President Trump's order that suspended asylum access at the southern border, stating that neither the constitution nor federal immigration law permits such a decision. The proclamation, issued on Trump's first day in office, aimed to deny entry to asylum seekers, which the court deemed a complete ban on asylum. Asylum has been a part of U.S. law since 1980, allowing individuals to seek refuge if they can demonstrate a credible fear of persecution. Advocacy groups, including the ACLU and the Texas Civil Rights Project, filed a lawsuit against this policy, arguing it endangered lives of those fleeing violence. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss emphasized that the president cannot create an alternative immigration system that overrides congressional statutes. The ruling is set to take effect in two weeks, with the Trump administration likely to appeal. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller criticized the decision, labeling the judge as "marxist" and claiming it protects future illegal aliens. This case highlights the ongoing legal battles over immigration policies and the rights of asylum seekers in the U.S.
