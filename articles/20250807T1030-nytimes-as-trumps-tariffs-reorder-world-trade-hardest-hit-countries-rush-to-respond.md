## Article summary
President Trump's new tariffs on virtually every U.S. trading partner mark a significant step in his attempt to reorder global trade, leaving some of the hardest-hit governments scrambling to respond. Major U.S. trade partners, including the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, will face a 15% tariff on their exports to the United States, while other countries face higher tariffs, such as Taiwan with a 20% levy. Trump has doubled tariffs on India to 50% as punishment for its continued purchase of Russian oil. The highest tariff for any developed nation, 39%, has gone into effect for Switzerland. The tariffs are expected to drive up prices for American consumers and businesses. Trump's tariff agenda has seen many twists and turns since he first proclaimed 'Liberation Day' this spring. The tariffs are part of Trump's long-time goal to smash a global trade system he believes has robbed America of jobs and money, but critics argue it will leave the U.S. economically and diplomatically isolated. The tariffs do not include China, which remains in an uneasy truce with the United States. The current 90-day pause on trade between the world's largest economies is set to expire on Tuesday. The new tariffs apply to dozens of nations and will take effect on August 7, with most facing tariffs between 15 and 50%.
