## Article summary
Pope Francis, currently hospitalized due to a complicated lung infection, had a peaceful night following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, according to the Vatican. The 88-year-old pontiff is in critical condition, having experienced a prolonged asthmatic episode while being treated for pneumonia. He received high-flow oxygen and blood transfusions due to low platelet counts, which can arise from infections or medication side effects. Despite his serious health issues, including a history of lung disease, the pope remains alert and is under strict medical care with a focus on recovery.

There are concerns about the potential onset of sepsis, a severe complication of pneumonia, but as of the last update, there was no evidence of this condition. Speculation about a possible resignation has been addressed by Vatican officials, emphasizing that the pope is still conscious and capable of fulfilling his duties. Meanwhile, Holy Year celebrations continue at the Vatican in his absence, with deacons participating in the festivities. The Vatican has reiterated that the focus should be on the pope's health and recovery rather than rumors about his future.
