## Article summary
Elon Musk's partnership with President Trump has faced significant challenges, particularly following a recent fallout, yet the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has become entrenched within the federal government. Despite Musk's sidelining, DOGE continues to influence agencies like the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, where staff members are now integral to operations. The group's initial goal of massive budget cuts has been somewhat realized, although legal battles and internal conflicts threaten its stability. Recent legal victories for DOGE, including access to sensitive Social Security data, suggest a continued push for reform, even as concerns about potential retaliatory actions against DOGE members loom. Musk's vision involved a radical overhaul of government operations, but the projected savings have been criticized for inaccuracies. Key DOGE figures have taken on significant roles, pushing forward projects aligned with Trump's agenda. However, the fallout from Musk's actions has caused unease among DOGE employees, leading some to consider leaving. The future of DOGE may hinge on ongoing court challenges questioning its legitimacy and authority within the executive branch. Overall, while DOGE has made strides, its long-term viability remains uncertain amid political and legal turbulence.
