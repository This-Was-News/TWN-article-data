## Article summary
On March 15, 2025, a significant upheaval occurred at Voice of America (VOA) and other U.S.-funded networks, leading to the indefinite suspension of 1,300 employees. This action followed a directive from President Trump mandating the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to eliminate non-essential activities. Contracts with several international broadcasters, including Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, were terminated, a move described by former USAGM officials as "Bloody Saturday." Critics, including VOA's director, expressed deep concern over the impact on independent journalism and the loss of credibility in delivering news to audiences in restrictive environments. 

The decision sparked outrage among staff and supporters, who feared it would empower authoritarian regimes. The networks, which reach 420 million people globally, are intended to provide vital news coverage where free press is suppressed. Trump's administration has faced bipartisan criticism for its attempts to control and undermine these outlets, which have historically received support from both political parties. The suspended staff were instructed to cease all work-related activities, although they remain on full pay. The situation reflects ongoing tensions between the U.S. government and independent media, particularly in the context of foreign relations.
