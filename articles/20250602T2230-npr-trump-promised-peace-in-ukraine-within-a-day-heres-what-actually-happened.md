## Article summary
The article discusses Donald Trump's promises to achieve peace in Ukraine within a day, which remain unfulfilled more than four months into his second term. Despite Russia proposing new peace negotiations, both Ukraine and Russia are entrenched in their positions regarding territorial disputes, making progress unlikely. Trump has shown frustration with the stalled process and suggested he might withdraw from negotiations if no progress is made. Analysts warn that a U.S. withdrawal could shift the balance of power in favor of Russia. 

In the early months of Trump's administration, he initiated calls with both Putin and Zelenskyy but later signaled a significant policy shift, indicating that Ukraine might need to cede territory. Initial peace talks yielded limited results, with both sides rejecting a U.S. proposal that recognized Russian control over seized territories. A recent face-to-face meeting in Istanbul resulted in a prisoner exchange but little advancement on broader peace efforts. The fighting continues, with Russia launching significant attacks despite diplomatic overtures. Analysts suggest that potential concessions from Ukraine, such as forgoing NATO membership, could be necessary for negotiations to progress.
