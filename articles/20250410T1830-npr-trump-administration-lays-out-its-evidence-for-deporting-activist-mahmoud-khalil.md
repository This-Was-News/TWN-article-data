## Article summary
The Trump administration has presented its case for deporting activist Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student, based primarily on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This letter accuses Khalil of participating in "antisemitic protests and disruptive activities," but his attorneys argue that it lacks substantial evidence, stating, "Two pages. That's it." The letter claims Khalil's presence in the U.S. could harm foreign policy interests, but his legal team contends that it does not meet the legal standard for deportation. Khalil's case has highlighted concerns regarding the targeting of immigrants for their political beliefs, as he maintains he was advocating for Palestinian rights. The Department of Homeland Security has also charged Khalil with civil violations related to his green card application, which his lawyers deny. An immigration judge is set to rule on Khalil's case, which has implications for how the administration can manage deportations of noncitizen protesters. Advocates for free speech argue that the government's actions violate constitutional rights. Khalil's situation exemplifies the broader tensions surrounding immigration policy and political activism in the U.S.
