## Article summary
Sae Joon Park, a 55-year-old U.S. Army veteran, self-deported to South Korea after nearly 50 years in the U.S. due to a deportation order stemming from past drug possession charges and failure to appear in court, which he attributes to untreated PTSD from his military service. Park, who came to the U.S. at age 7, served honorably in the Army and was awarded a Purple Heart after being shot during the 1989 invasion of Panama. Despite his service, he faced challenges in obtaining citizenship because he did not meet the necessary criteria for expedited naturalization. After battling addiction and spending three years in prison, he moved to Hawaii, where he rebuilt his life and raised his children. Recently, immigration authorities gave him an ultimatum to leave voluntarily or face detention. Before departing, Park reflected on his time in the U.S., expressing disbelief at his situation and sadness at leaving his family, particularly his elderly mother. He spent his final days enjoying cherished moments with loved ones and reminiscing about his journey. Ultimately, he stated that he does not regret his military service, as it has shaped who he is today.
