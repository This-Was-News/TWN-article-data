## Article summary
The article "Fearing Retribution, Trump Critics Muzzle Themselves" discusses the atmosphere of intimidation surrounding critics of former President Trump during his second administration. Many individuals, including federal workers, university presidents, and business leaders, are choosing silence over fear of online attacks, potential harm to their businesses, or threats to their families. As a result, political discourse has significantly chilled in Washington, with even prominent Republicans refraining from vocal opposition to Trump’s policies and actions. 

Experts, like Harvard professor Steven Levitsky, suggest that this behavior indicates a troubling trend towards authoritarianism, where societal leaders modify their actions to avoid government backlash. Trump’s aggressive stance, including threats against critics and revoking security details for high-profile dissenters, has exacerbated this fear. While some, like Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, openly criticize the administration's rhetoric as authoritarian, many others remain silent out of self-preservation. 

The article highlights that while some Republicans express concern over personal safety rather than job security, others dismiss claims of authoritarianism as exaggerated. Despite the pervasive silence, there are signs of resistance, as a letter from former defense secretaries condemning Trump's actions indicates a potential shift in the discourse. Overall, the document illustrates a significant impact on political and intellectual life due to fear of retribution from the Trump administration.
