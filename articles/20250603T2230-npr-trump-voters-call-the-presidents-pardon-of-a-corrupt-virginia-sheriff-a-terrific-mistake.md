## Article summary
Donald Trump's recent pardon of former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was sentenced to 10 years for bribery and related charges, has sparked significant backlash among voters in the area, including many Trump supporters. Despite over 60% of Culpeper residents voting for Trump in 2024, local sentiments reflect that the pardon is viewed as a "terrific mistake" and a failure of the justice system. Many residents expressed disbelief and disappointment, with a retired entrepreneur stating that Jenkins "needed to go to jail." NPR's interviews indicated that nearly everyone opposed the pardon, with only one dissenting opinion that remained off the record.

Jenkins, a staunch Trump supporter, was convicted for effectively selling deputy badges to businessmen, which prosecutors argued undermined public trust. Influential Trump ally Roger Stone reportedly advocated for the pardon, suggesting Jenkins was politically targeted. Residents speculated about how Trump became aware of Jenkins' case, with some suggesting a shared "victim mentality" between the former sheriff and the president. Critics voiced concerns about the implications of pardoning a convicted felon while others face detention without due process. Jenkins, who served three terms as sheriff, has largely withdrawn from public life following his indictment and subsequent failed reelection bid.
