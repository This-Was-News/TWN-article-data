## Article summary
The article discusses how Donald Trump is attempting to reshape the presidency by dismantling checks and balances within the executive branch. Since his return to office, Trump has targeted independent agencies and inspectors general, asserting control over federal governance and challenging the independence of the Justice Department. Supporters argue that his approach is aligned with the "unitary executive theory," which posits that the president should have broad authority over the executive branch. Critics warn that these actions could lead to a significant reduction in accountability and oversight, raising concerns about potential corruption and the undermining of democratic principles.

Polling indicates that a majority of Americans prefer maintaining the current separation of powers, with many believing Trump has overstepped his authority. Legal experts suggest that Trump's strategy may be aimed at testing the limits of presidential power in the courts, potentially reshaping the political landscape if successful. While accountability mechanisms like elections and congressional oversight still exist, Trump's second-term status may shield him from public opinion pressures. Ultimately, the article highlights the ongoing legal and political battles surrounding Trump's presidency and the implications for American democracy.
