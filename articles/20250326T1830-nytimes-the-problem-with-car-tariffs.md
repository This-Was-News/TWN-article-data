## Article summary
The article discusses the implications of car tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, particularly how they affect American automakers and consumers. It highlights the complexity of modern automotive supply chains, which often span multiple countries, making it difficult to categorize vehicles as entirely American-made or imported. For instance, while the Chevrolet Blazer is assembled in Mexico, it uses components from the U.S., and the Toyota RAV4, primarily made in Canada, contains a significant percentage of U.S.-sourced parts. The piece emphasizes that a vehicle is classified as an import if it is shipped to the U.S. after final assembly abroad, regardless of the origin of its parts.

The article notes that tariffs could severely impact the U.S. auto industry, with executives from major automakers expressing concerns about the potential economic fallout. Historical data shows that the number of imported vehicles has remained fairly stable over the past two decades, with Mexico being the largest source. Consumer attitudes toward the origin of their vehicles vary, with some buyers prioritizing assembly location over component origins. Overall, the article underscores the challenges posed by tariffs in a globalized automotive market.
