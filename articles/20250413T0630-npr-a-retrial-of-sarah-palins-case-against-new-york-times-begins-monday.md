## Article summary
A retrial of Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set to begin in federal court in Manhattan. This follows her previous losses in early 2022, where she failed to prove that the Times' editorial linked her to the 2011 Tucson shooting that resulted in six deaths. The case arose from a 2017 editorial that Palin's attorneys argued falsely accused her of inciting violence. Despite her uphill battle due to high defamation standards for public figures, an appellate court found procedural errors in the initial trial, allowing the retrial. The Times had quickly corrected the editorial after acknowledging its inaccuracies. Palin's legal team is not seeking financial damages in this retrial, raising questions about her motivations. The trial is expected to last at least a week, with jury selection starting soon. The outcome could have implications for press freedoms established in a landmark Supreme Court ruling. The Times has not commented publicly on the case.
