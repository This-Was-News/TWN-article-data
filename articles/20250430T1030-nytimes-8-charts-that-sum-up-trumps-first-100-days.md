## Article summary
The first 100 days of Donald Trump's second presidency have been marked by notable extremes, particularly when contrasted with previous administrations. Trump has signed more executive orders than any modern president, utilizing them to bypass legislative processes and direct federal agencies on various issues. This approach has led to a surge in lawsuits against him, attributed to the rapid implementation of controversial policies. His economic strategy heavily relies on tariffs, resulting in increased federal revenue but also sparking debates about the impact on consumers and companies. The dollar's value has significantly declined, particularly following tariff announcements, while stock market performance has suffered, with the S&P 500 experiencing its worst start since Gerald Ford's presidency. The State Department's activities have decreased, reflecting broader efforts to reshape government operations, including cuts to foreign aid and the NIH's research funding. Trump's approval ratings have plummeted, turning strengths in areas like the economy and immigration into weaknesses. Overall, his presidency has faced significant challenges and controversies within its first 100 days.
