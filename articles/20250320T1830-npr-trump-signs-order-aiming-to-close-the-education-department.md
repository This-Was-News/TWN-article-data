## Article summary
President Trump is set to sign an executive order aimed at dismantling the U.S. Department of Education, transferring educational authority back to the states. This decision follows significant staff reductions within the department, which has seen its workforce cut by nearly half since Trump took office. The order is expected to be signed during a ceremony with several Republican governors. The administration justifies this move by arguing that the department has failed to improve student achievement despite spending over $3 trillion since its creation in 1979. Critics, including Senator Patty Murray, argue that these actions will harm public education and undermine support for vulnerable students. 

The draft order acknowledges legal limitations, stating that the department's responsibilities cannot be altered without congressional approval. Public sentiment appears largely against the closure, with a recent poll indicating 63% opposition. The administration claims that empowering states and local communities will lead to better educational outcomes. Despite assurances from Education Secretary Linda McMahon that key funding streams will not be defunded, concerns remain about the impact on essential services for students. Overall, the action reflects a significant shift in federal education policy under the Trump administration.
