## Article summary
Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 includes a 15% funding cut to the U.S. Department of Education, signaling a commitment to wind down the agency. Despite a federal judge blocking an executive order to close the department, the budget summary reflects a gradual dismantling process while requesting $66.7 billion for the department. Title I funding, crucial for schools in low-income areas, will remain at over $18 billion, alleviating some concerns from public school advocates. However, the budget suggests consolidating 18 smaller K-12 programs into one grant, significantly reducing funding from $6.5 billion to $2 billion, which may limit targeted support for specific needs, like students experiencing homelessness. 

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding appears to increase to $14.9 billion, but the overall impact on special education funding will remain flat due to the inclusion of previously separate programs. Additionally, the budget proposes cutting the maximum Federal Pell Grant from approximately $7,400 to $5,700, reversing long-standing commitments to aid low-income students. The Federal Work-Study program would also face an 80% funding reduction, shifting the financial burden to colleges and universities. Overall, the budget reflects a significant shift in federal education funding priorities, raising concerns among education advocates.
