## Article summary
The Smithsonian's board, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. as chancellor, navigated a tense meeting where President Trump's demand to fire the National Portrait Gallery's director was rejected. Roberts, known for his procedural focus, ensured the board's resolution to review content for bias succeeded, avoiding a direct confrontation with the president. The Smithsonian, led by its first Black CEO, Lonnie G. Bunch III, has faced controversies, including past issues with abolitionist lectures and recent political tensions over exhibits. Roberts, a history enthusiast, enjoys his role at the Smithsonian, which includes perks like early access to panda births and historical artifacts. The institution now faces increased political scrutiny from the Trump administration, with Roberts' leadership role becoming more politically significant amid efforts to influence the board's composition and content.
