## Article summary
The article discusses the heightened scrutiny faced by green card holders and travelers due to stricter immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. It highlights the case of Lewelyn Dixon, a lawful permanent resident detained upon returning to the U.S. after a trip to the Philippines, due to a decades-old felony conviction for embezzlement. Immigration lawyers indicate that past infractions are increasingly being used as grounds for detention, even for individuals with valid immigration status. 

The article notes that the current enforcement environment has made international travel riskier for green card holders, with reports of detentions based on minor offenses or misunderstandings regarding visas. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) maintains that they are simply enforcing existing immigration laws, while critics argue that the approach lacks consistency and appropriateness. 

Dixon's detention has deeply affected her family, as she has played a significant role in their lives since immigrating to the U.S. at a young age. Legal experts advise green card holders to consider naturalization to avoid potential complications when traveling abroad. The article concludes by emphasizing the uncertainty and fear surrounding international travel for lawful permanent residents with any criminal history.
