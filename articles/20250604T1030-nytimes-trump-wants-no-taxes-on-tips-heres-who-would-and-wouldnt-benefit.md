## Article summary
The proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, backed by President Trump and supported by lawmakers, appears popular but would have limited benefits. Only about 3% of American workers receive tips, and a significant portion of those would not see any financial gain from the change. The legislation is designed to primarily benefit workers in industries like dining, creating disparities between tipped and non-tipped employees. Many low-earning tipped workers would not benefit much due to their income often falling below the standard deduction threshold. Although the exemption applies only to federal income tax, workers still owe payroll taxes on their tips, impacting low-income earners more significantly. Some may already have their tax liabilities eliminated by other deductions, limiting the usefulness of the tips deduction. Higher earners would receive the most significant benefits, with potential tax cuts around $1,800 for those who owe income taxes. However, the bill restricts the deduction for tipped workers making over $160,000, creating a disincentive to earn beyond that amount. The policy is temporary, set to last only through 2028, and many tax experts criticize it for complicating the tax system further. Overall, the proposed tax break raises concerns about fairness and equity in tax policy.
