## Article summary
Palestinian medical officials claim to have obtained video footage that contradicts Israeli assertions regarding the deaths of 15 rescue and aid workers in Gaza. The Israeli military initially stated that their troops opened fire on suspicious vehicles approaching without headlights on March 23. However, the Palestine Red Crescent Society released a video showing clearly marked rescue vehicles with emergency lights flashing, filmed from inside one of the vehicles during heavy gunfire. A voice in the video expresses a commitment to helping people despite the danger.

An Israeli military official acknowledged an ongoing investigation into the incident, denying allegations of soldiers shooting medics at close range or mistreating their bodies afterward. The bodies of the emergency responders were discovered in a mass grave on March 31 after being missing for over a week. Jonathan Whittall from the U.N. described the situation as a horror, emphasizing the responders' intention to save lives. The U.N. reports that 408 aid workers have been killed during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Israel has resumed military operations in the region following a ceasefire, aiming to pressure Hamas and secure the release of hostages.
