## Article summary
A heavily armed assailant shot through the windows of a Catholic church in Minneapolis on Wednesday, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injuring 17 others. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators are examining writings and YouTube videos left behind by the assailant, which contained disturbing entries describing the killing of children and drawings of the church's sanctuary. The church has a school for children from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade, and the shooting occurred during an all-school Mass, an annual tradition. Of the 17 injured, 14 were children aged 6 to 15, and three were parishioners in their 80s. The F.B.I. is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. The guns used in the attack were lawfully purchased, and at least two doors of the church had been barricaded from the outside. Witnesses described harrowing scenes inside the church, with bullets ripping through the windows for about two minutes. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis expressed the gravity and tragedy of the situation, emphasizing the need for stricter gun laws. Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota and President Trump have also reacted to the shooting, with Trump signing a proclamation ordering flags nationwide to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday in tribute to the victims.
