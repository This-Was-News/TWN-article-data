## Article summary
President Trump signed an executive order to create a 'quick reaction force' within the National Guard for domestic deployment in response to civil disturbances. The order also establishes an online portal for Americans with law enforcement experience to join federal entities tasked with ensuring public safety. Army National Guard veteran Christopher Purdy, who served in a specialized unit post-9/11, expressed concerns about the order's implications. He noted that the scope and implementation details of the new unit are unclear, with potential sizes ranging from 100 to 1,000 troops. Purdy highlighted the dangerous nature of involving the National Guard in law enforcement roles, especially under the control of the president via the D.C. National Guard. He expressed discomfort with the idea of policing communities for First Amendment activities and worried about the potential misuse of the Guard against American citizens. The order raises significant legal and ethical questions, particularly regarding the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement. Purdy urged courts to reject the order's legal theories, emphasizing its potential to undermine democratic principles. The executive order also expands the law enforcement roles of other federal agencies, such as the Park Service and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, making it both expansive and dangerous.
