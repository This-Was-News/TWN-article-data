## Article summary
A CDC drowning prevention program, which aimed to answer basic statistical questions about drowning incidents and prevention strategies, was halted and its team terminated by the Trump administration. The program, initiated in response to a spike in drowning deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, collaborated with organizations like the YMCA and the Red Cross to collect data and teach swimming skills to high-risk children, including those with autism. The program's budget was relatively small but impactful, focusing on reducing drowning risks and sharing effective strategies. The termination of the program has been criticized for its potential to lose valuable insights and opportunities, particularly in smaller communities.
