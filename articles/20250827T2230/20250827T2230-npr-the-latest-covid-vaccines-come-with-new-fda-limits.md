## Article summary
The FDA has approved the latest COVID-19 vaccines but restricted them to individuals at higher risk, such as those aged 65 and older or with certain health conditions. This change limits access for healthy children and younger adults, causing confusion and concern. The CDC has dropped guidelines recommending routine vaccination for healthy children and pregnant women, a decision criticized by many doctors and public health experts. Federal health officials justify the changes due to widespread immunity, but their safety and effectiveness are supported by scientific evidence. The new restrictions may make it difficult for many to access the vaccines, as insurance coverage and healthcare providers' willingness to administer them may be affected. Public health authorities warn that these limits could increase severe COVID cases and hospitalizations. The changes are part of a broader shift in vaccine policy, with some medical groups continuing to recommend vaccination for high-risk individuals, including pregnant women and young children. Despite the restrictions, some people may still seek vaccination through prescriptions or out-of-pocket payments, though barriers like cost and provider reluctance remain. The conflicting guidelines and messages may further reduce vaccination rates, exacerbating public health concerns amid ongoing COVID-19 waves.
