## Article summary
A heavily armed assailant shot through the windows of a Catholic church in Minneapolis on Wednesday, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injuring 17 others. The attacker, identified as Robin Westman, 23, was a former student at the church's school and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators are reviewing the suspect's social media accounts, which contain disturbing videos and writings. The church had just begun its school year, and the shooting occurred during an all-school Mass. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz expressed their condolences and called for stricter gun laws. The church and school community are in shock and mourning, with some children still hospitalized. The attack was one of four deadly shootings in Minneapolis within 24 hours.
