## Article summary
Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement announcement sparked a wave of congratulatory messages from brands across various industries. Companies like Cheesecake Factory, Southwest Airlines, and Scrub Daddy posted creative and self-referential content, while others like Olipop and DoorDash offered special deals tied to Swift's favorite number, 13. Marketing expert Branne Fleming noted that brands are leveraging the engagement to connect with their audiences, as Swift's influence is vast. However, some critics argue that brands are becoming too opportunistic, jumping on cultural moments without adding meaningful value. Marcus Collins, a professor at the University of Michigan, highlighted that while quick reactions can be beneficial, they often lead to saturation and audience disengagement. He praised brands like Ralph Lauren and Starbucks for striking the right balance, contributing to the discourse in a relevant way. Panera Bread also successfully capitalized on Swift's sourdough obsession, launching special merchandise and a Swift-inspired meal. As Swift's upcoming album release and potential wedding loom, brands will need to navigate the fine line between celebration and capitalization, following audience engagement as a guide.
