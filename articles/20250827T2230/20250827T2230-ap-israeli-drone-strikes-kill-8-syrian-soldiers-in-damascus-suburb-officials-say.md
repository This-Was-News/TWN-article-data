## Article summary
Israeli drone strikes on a southern suburb of Damascus killed eight Syrian soldiers and wounded others, according to officials and a war monitor. Syria's Foreign Ministry condemned the attack as a violation of international law and a breach of its sovereignty. The strikes targeted soldiers who discovered surveillance devices, with ongoing attacks preventing others from reaching the area. Since the fall of Bashar Assad, Israel has conducted numerous airstrikes on Syria, destroying military assets. The new authorities in Damascus claim they do not seek conflict with Israel, but Israel remains suspicious. Israel's Defense Minister stated that Israeli forces will remain indefinitely in a security zone to protect settlements from Syrian threats. The strikes hit an area linking Damascus with the southern province of Sweida, which recently saw clashes between pro-government forces and Druze fighters. Israel intervened in the fighting to support the Druze minority. The area struck had military posts for Assad's forces before his fall. Earlier, an Israeli drone strike near Quneitra killed one person, further condemned by Syria's Foreign Ministry as a violation of international law.
