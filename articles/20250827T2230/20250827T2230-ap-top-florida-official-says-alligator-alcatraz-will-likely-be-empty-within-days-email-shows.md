## Article summary
A top Florida official has stated that the controversial 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention center in the Everglades will likely be empty within days. This revelation comes from an email exchange shared with The Associated Press, where Florida's Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie mentioned the facility would soon have no detainees. Governor Ron DeSantis attributed the declining population to increased deportations by the Department of Homeland Security. The facility, constructed rapidly to hold up to 3,000 detainees, peaked at nearly 1,000 but now has around 300-350. A federal judge ordered the center to shut down by late October, though the state has appealed. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe oppose the facility, citing threats to sensitive wetlands. Lawsuits have highlighted severe problems, including inadequate living conditions and legal issues. Despite these challenges, the state has spent over $245 million on the facility, which opened in July.
