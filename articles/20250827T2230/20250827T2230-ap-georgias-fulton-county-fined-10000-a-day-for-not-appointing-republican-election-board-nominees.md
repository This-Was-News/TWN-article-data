## Article summary
Fulton County, Georgia, is fined $10,000 daily for not appointing Republican nominees to its election board. Judge David Emerson ruled that the county's Board of Commissioners must appoint the nominees, finding them in civil contempt for not complying with earlier orders. The nominees, Jule Adams and Jason Frazer, were rejected by the Democratic-majority board, citing past actions. The judge ordered the fines to start Friday and also required the board to pay the Republican Party's legal costs. The dispute highlights the intense focus on Georgia's elections, a key swing state. Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold, has been the center of election fraud conspiracy theories. The election board consists of five members, with nominees selected by party leaders. The Republican Party sued after their nominees were rejected, arguing that the law mandates approval of qualified nominees. The judge sided with the Republicans, ordering the appointments. The commissioners plan to appeal and request a suspension of the fines. This conflict echoes a similar dispute from two years ago, where the same arguments were used to block Frazer's nomination.
