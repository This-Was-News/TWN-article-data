## Article summary
Corporate America's retreat from diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives has resulted in the elimination of over 2,600 jobs in the sector since early 2023, representing about 13% of DEI-related positions. This shift has been fueled by a growing political backlash against DEI, particularly following executive orders from former President Trump aimed at dismantling such programs. Companies like Verizon, Walmart, and Target have begun to roll back their DEI policies, often replacing the terminology with more generic terms like "belonging." The decline in DEI roles disproportionately affects women and people of color, who previously made up a significant portion of the workforce in this field. Candace Byrdsong Williams, a veteran DEI executive, exemplifies the struggles faced by many in the profession as she navigates a challenging job market after being laid off. Despite her extensive experience, she finds herself in a saturated and shrinking job pool, leading to feelings of isolation and uncertainty. While some companies maintain a commitment to diversity, they are hiring fewer DEI specialists, with many positions being rebranded or eliminated altogether. The overall trend indicates a potential long-term decline in workplace diversity, as the retreat from DEI initiatives could hinder efforts to create inclusive environments. As Byrdsong Williams continues her job search, she remains hopeful for the future of her work in promoting diversity and inclusion.
