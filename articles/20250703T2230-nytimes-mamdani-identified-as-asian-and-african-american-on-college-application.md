## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, has highlighted his identity as a Muslim immigrant of South Asian descent during his campaign. In 2009, while applying to Columbia University, he identified himself as both Asian and Black or African American, a choice he later explained as an attempt to capture his complex background, although he does not consider himself Black or African American. Mr. Mamdani's application details emerged from a cyberattack on Columbia's admissions data, which sought to investigate the university's use of race-conscious affirmative action after a Supreme Court ruling in 2023. Although he was not accepted at Columbia, he filled out similar applications in the same manner. His diverse heritage includes being born in Uganda to Indian parents, and he later moved to New York City. Throughout his campaign, he has actively engaged with South Asian communities and emphasized his African roots to appeal to a broad voter base. Despite facing challenges in gaining support from Black voters, he has continued to advocate for inclusive demographic data collection. His identity has drawn scrutiny from right-wing critics, including President Trump, who have targeted his immigrant background and faith. Mr. Mamdani aims to unite diverse communities while addressing economic issues in his platform.
