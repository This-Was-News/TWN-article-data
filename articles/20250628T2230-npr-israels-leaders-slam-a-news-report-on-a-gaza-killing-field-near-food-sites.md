## Article summary
Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned a report by _Haaretz_ alleging that Israeli soldiers were ordered to shoot at unarmed civilians seeking food in Gaza, labeling it as "blood libel." The report cites anonymous soldiers claiming they were instructed to fire on crowds at food distribution sites, which has resulted in over 500 deaths in the past month, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The military denies these accusations, stating soldiers are not directed to intentionally harm civilians, and an investigation into the incidents is underway. The distribution sites, operated by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, have faced criticism for their erratic operation and the dangers posed to civilians. Aid groups, including Doctors Without Borders, refuse to collaborate with the foundation, arguing that humanitarian aid should not be manipulated for military objectives. Medical personnel report treating numerous injuries from shootings near these sites, describing the situation as dire and inhumane. Witnesses have observed food being sold on the black market, indicating systemic issues with aid distribution. The U.N. Secretary-General has called for acknowledgment of the violations of international law occurring in Gaza. Overall, the situation highlights a complex interplay of humanitarian needs and military actions in the region.
