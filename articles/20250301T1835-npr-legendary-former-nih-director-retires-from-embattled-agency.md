## Article summary
Dr. Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has retired after over three decades at the agency, including serving as director from 2009 to 2021. His departure comes amid significant challenges for the NIH, which is experiencing cutbacks and layoffs under the Trump administration. Collins, known for his contributions to genetics and his role in mapping the human genome, expressed gratitude for his time at the NIH, highlighting the dedication of his colleagues. He has faced criticism during the pandemic but also played a key role in accelerating vaccine development.

Collins's retirement was effective immediately, and he did not provide specific reasons for his decision. His leadership was praised by peers, who acknowledged his impact on genomic medicine and biomedical research. The NIH is currently under pressure from the administration to limit its grant-making capabilities, which could hinder medical research. As Collins steps down, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is poised to take over the agency, marking a significant transition for the NIH during a turbulent period.
