## Article summary
Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and activist, became a target amid heightened tensions surrounding pro-Palestinian protests on campus. As a Syrian immigrant of Palestinian descent, Khalil emerged as a prominent leader during demonstrations against Israel, notably refusing to wear a mask, which put him in the spotlight. His activism drew criticism, and on March 8, 2025, federal agents detained him, alleging his involvement with activities aligned with Hamas, a claim he denies.

Khalil's journey began in a Palestinian refugee enclave in Syria, from where he fled to Lebanon due to conflict, eventually arriving at Columbia in January 2023. His outspoken nature during protests, including a significant encampment at Columbia demanding divestment from Israel, led to a clash with university administration and law enforcement. Despite being a negotiator for student protests, he was accused of promoting terrorism.

In January 2025, following an executive order from President Trump targeting antisemitism, Khalil was singled out online, leading to fears of deportation. His concerns about doxxing and harassment escalated, culminating in his arrest despite holding a green card. Khalil's friends and family have expressed outrage at his detention, emphasizing his commitment to peaceful activism and his lack of involvement in violent rhetoric. The situation highlights broader issues of free speech, activism, and the complexities surrounding immigration status in politically charged environments.
