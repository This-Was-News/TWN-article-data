## Article summary
The family of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, arrested for a firebomb attack in Boulder, Colorado, is now in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed their detention while authorities investigate whether the family had any knowledge or involvement in the attack. Soliman faces multiple charges, including attempted murder and a federal hate crime, and is held on a $10 million bond. His wife and children have been cooperative, with no charges against them at this time. Soliman, originally from Egypt, came to the U.S. on a tourist visa in 2022 and applied for asylum, which is still pending. His immigration status may affect his family's situation, as they could be sent to a family detention center in Texas. Local immigration lawyer Bryce Downer noted that asylum applications often take years due to backlog issues. The family's eligibility for bond will depend on their perceived involvement in Soliman's actions. If convicted, Soliman could face life imprisonment.
