## Article summary
The article discusses the significant economic impact of President Trump's newly imposed universal tariffs on all U.S. trade partners, marking a drastic shift in U.S. trade policy. Affected products include electronics from Taiwan, wine from Italy, and frozen shrimp from India, with tariffs reaching as high as 46% for Vietnam and 49% for Cambodia. The 10% baseline duty on all imports, along with higher tariffs for specific countries like China and the European Union, has alarmed global markets and raised concerns of a potential trade war. Countries such as China and South Korea are preparing countermeasures and calling for negotiations, while Japan expressed regret over the unexpected tariff levels. Analysts predict that these tariffs could result in an annual increase of $600 billion in U.S. tariffs, particularly impacting developing nations that rely on exports. The situation complicates decisions for U.S. businesses, with some considering manufacturing shifts to avoid tariffs. Overall, the article highlights the chaotic landscape of international trade as nations grapple with the repercussions of Trump's aggressive tariff strategy.
