## Article summary
The escalating feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump threatens to disrupt their previously established alliance, with potential repercussions for both. Musk could retaliate by leveraging his wealth to fund campaigns against Trump and his allies, having previously invested heavily in Trump's election. He has also utilized social media to stir public sentiment, including a poll about forming a new political party and comments suggesting Trump's impeachment. Additionally, Musk could create controversy by alleging that Trump’s administration delayed releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein and threaten to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, impacting NASA operations.

On the other hand, Trump might respond by cutting government contracts with Musk’s companies, which are valued at $3 billion across various agencies. There are calls for investigations into Musk's immigration status and drug use, despite him being a naturalized citizen. Trump could revoke Musk's security clearance, complicating his government collaborations. Furthermore, Trump has the authority to use executive orders and direct investigations against Musk, potentially targeting Musk's initiatives and political affiliations. This conflict exemplifies the significant influence both figures wield in politics and business.
