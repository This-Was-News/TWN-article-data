## Article summary
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been attempting to expand its influence beyond traditional executive branch agencies, targeting small independent entities and non-governmental organizations. Recently, the Government Accountability Office rejected DOGE's request to embed staffers, emphasizing its independence as a legislative branch agency. DOGE's outreach has included close to 40 entities, some of which have faced significant cuts or restructuring, such as the U.S. Institute of Peace and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The initiative is largely driven by a group of young staffers with limited government experience, including college students. 

DOGE has been accused of conducting meetings aimed at dismantling or significantly reducing the operations of these agencies, often using aggressive tactics. For instance, after DOGE's intervention, the Institute of Museum and Library Services saw its entire staff placed on administrative leave. While the organization has pursued budget cuts, it has also approached private nonprofits that receive federal funding, like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which have rebuffed its requests. The overarching goal of DOGE appears to align with President Trump's budget proposals aimed at reducing federal spending. Despite Elon Musk's reduced involvement, DOGE's activities continue to reflect a commitment to implementing the administration's cost-cutting agenda.
