## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the United States may abandon efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine if no significant progress is made soon. Speaking after discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron, Rubio emphasized the need for urgency in ending the conflict, stating that a decision would be made in the coming days. It remains unclear whether this means abandoning efforts for a cease-fire or U.S. commitments to Ukraine entirely. Rubio's comments are intended to pressure both Russia and Ukraine toward compromise. The Trump administration has been involved in high-level talks aimed at unifying perspectives on the war between Washington and European leaders. Rubio noted that while the U.S. has supported Ukraine for three years, it is not America's war. The ongoing Russian bombardment and Putin's demands for territorial concessions have been significant obstacles. Future meetings in London are planned to continue diplomatic efforts, with hopes that European nations can facilitate progress. Rubio expressed appreciation for the constructive ideas shared during the Paris talks.
