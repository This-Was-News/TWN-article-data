## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's approach to civil rights protections, highlighting his recent shift from opposing diversity initiatives to using them to advocate for white men. Trump's administration has abandoned key principles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming they prioritize diversity over merit. Recent investigations by federal agencies target institutions that promote diversity, suggesting that white men are the most discriminated group in society. This includes investigations into Chicago's hiring practices and Harvard University's faculty demographics, where the administration alleges discrimination against white men. Critics, including civil rights experts, argue that these actions reflect a misapplication of civil rights law and a focus on retribution rather than genuine equality. The White House defends its actions as promoting merit-based decisions and equality, but many see this as a hypocritical stance given the administration's previous criticism of disparate impact analysis. The article concludes that the investigations appear driven by a vendetta rather than a commitment to protecting civil rights for all groups.
