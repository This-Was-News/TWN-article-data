## Article summary
In a highly charged Oval Office meeting, President Trump and Vice President JD Vance confronted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of lacking gratitude for U.S. military aid during the ongoing war with Russia. The exchange escalated into a shouting match, with Trump asserting that Zelensky was not in a strong negotiating position and gambling with the risk of World War III. The confrontation derailed plans for a minerals deal that would have allowed Ukraine to repay U.S. military assistance. Trump later indicated on social media that he believed Zelensky was not ready for peace negotiations while America was involved.

The public altercation marked a stark departure from traditional diplomatic decorum, as Trump criticized Zelensky for his perceived disrespect towards the U.S. administration. Vance echoed Trump's sentiments, suggesting that Zelensky should be more appreciative of U.S. support. Following the meeting, Zelensky attempted to express gratitude but left without signing the anticipated minerals agreement. The fallout from this encounter appeared to bolster Russian President Vladimir Putin's position, highlighting the growing rift between Ukraine and its primary ally, the United States. The incident raised questions about the future of U.S.-Ukraine relations and the potential for peace in the region.
