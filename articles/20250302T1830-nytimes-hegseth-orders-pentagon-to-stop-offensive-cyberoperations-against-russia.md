## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to cease offensive cyber operations against Russia as part of a strategic re-evaluation aimed at encouraging negotiations between the U.S. and Russia regarding the Ukraine conflict. This decision was made prior to President Trump's contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The specifics of the halt remain unclear, particularly as the distinction between offensive and defensive cyber activities is often ambiguous. Former officials noted that pausing military operations during sensitive diplomatic efforts is common, but this move poses significant risks, relying on Russia to reciprocate and reduce its cyber aggression.

Critics, including Senator Chuck Schumer, argue that this decision gives Russia a "free pass" amid ongoing cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies. The order may also jeopardize existing cooperation with European nations in countering Russian cyber threats, especially as ransomware attacks linked to Russia have surged. While the Trump administration has previously escalated cyber operations against Russia, this retreat could diminish the U.S.'s ability to monitor Russian intentions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the need for diplomatic engagement with Russia, although the effectiveness of this strategy remains uncertain. The implications of halting offensive operations could significantly impact U.S. national security and its stance in global cyber warfare.
