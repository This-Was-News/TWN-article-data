## Article summary
Six weeks after Benjamin Netanyahu's victory over Iran, his push for an all-or-nothing deal with Hamas has stalled due to a lack of necessary compromises. International condemnation of Gaza's growing starvation, largely blamed on Israel's blockade, has intensified, with allies recognizing Palestinian statehood in protest. Domestically, opposition to the Gaza war is at an all-time high, with calls to secure hostages through diplomacy and concerns over military sustainability and reservist fatigue. Analysts highlight Israel's multifaceted crises, including societal, military, diplomatic, and existential challenges. The prolonged conflict also reflects President Trump's failure to leverage his influence to end the war, as Netanyahu persuaded him to grant more time, leading to ongoing stalemates.
