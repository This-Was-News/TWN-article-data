## Article summary
Camp Mystic, established in 1926 in Texas Hill Country near the Guadalupe River, has faced numerous floods throughout its history. The first major flood in 1932 caused significant damage, leading to discussions about reopening the camp, but it was repaired and reopened. Subsequent floods in 1951, 1978, 1987, 1988, and 2025 caused varying degrees of damage, evacuations, and fatalities, with the 2025 flood being the deadliest, resulting in 27 deaths. Despite efforts to mitigate risks, such as rebuilding cabins and installing river gauges, the camp's location has repeatedly proven vulnerable to flooding. The camp's owner, Dick Eastland, emphasized the need to respect the river's power and took measures to ensure camper safety, but the 2025 flood ultimately claimed his life among others.
