## Article summary
Trump's announcement of across-the-board tariffs has drawn parallels to Brexit, marking a significant withdrawal of the U.S. from the global economy. While the immediate impact is uncertain, economists believe that the benefits of free trade are too strong to be permanently undermined, and the global trading system may adapt without the U.S. as a central player. The tariffs signal a retreat from unfettered free trade, leading to a chaotic and potentially dangerous trading environment, especially in U.S.-China relations. Countries are likely to respond with either retaliatory tariffs or attempts to negotiate better deals with the U.S. 

The tariffs disproportionately affect low-income exporters, particularly in Africa, while the World Trade Organization predicts a reduction in global trade volume due to these measures. Despite the challenges, some experts suggest that Trump's tariffs could accelerate the formation of new trade agreements among other nations. The historical context of trade disputes indicates that while tariffs can create friction, they do not necessarily lead to armed conflict. Ultimately, Trump's actions may redefine the U.S.'s role in global trade, but the overall trend toward free trade is expected to persist.
