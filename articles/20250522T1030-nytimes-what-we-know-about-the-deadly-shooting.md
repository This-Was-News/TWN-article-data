A shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., resulted in the deaths of two employees from the Israeli Embassy, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 30, from Chicago, was taken into custody shortly after the attack and reportedly shouted pro-Palestinian slogans. The incident occurred during a reception for young diplomats, with Rodriguez targeting the victims as they left the event. Authorities are treating the shooting as an act of targeted violence, with the FBI involved in the investigation.

Israeli officials condemned the act, labeling it an antisemitic act of terrorism and linking it to the rise in antisemitism following the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar expressed concern over escalating violence against Jews globally. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for increased security for Israeli diplomatic missions. American officials, including Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and President Trump, also denounced the violence, emphasizing a commitment to combat hate and terrorism. The victims were reportedly close to becoming engaged, highlighting the personal tragedy of the incident.
