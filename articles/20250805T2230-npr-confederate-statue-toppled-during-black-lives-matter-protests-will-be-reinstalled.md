## Article summary
The National Park Service plans to restore and reinstall a toppled statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate general and Freemason leader, in Washington, D.C. The statue was removed by protesters during Black Lives Matter demonstrations in June 2020. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton opposes the reinstatement, citing Pike's controversial history, including his resignation in disgrace and alleged involvement with the Ku Klux Klan. The statue, dedicated in 1901, has long been contentious, with D.C. Council members calling for its removal since 1992. The National Park Service aims to reinstall the statue by October, aligning with federal preservation laws and executive orders.
