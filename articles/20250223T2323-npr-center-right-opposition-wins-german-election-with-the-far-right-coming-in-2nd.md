## Article summary
In the recent German election, the center-right opposition led by Friedrich Merz achieved a lackluster victory, while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) saw significant gains, doubling its support to around 20.5%. Chancellor Olaf Scholz conceded defeat for his center-left Social Democrats, which finished in third place with just over 16%, marking their worst postwar result. The election was held earlier than planned due to the collapse of Scholz's coalition, amid widespread discontent and economic stagnation. 

Merz expressed intentions to form a coalition government by Easter, although this may prove challenging given the current political landscape. The AfD's historic performance was celebrated by its leaders, who claimed to have moved from the political fringes to the center. However, Merz has ruled out coalition talks with AfD, citing fundamental differences in policies. 

The election results also indicated a strengthening of smaller parties, with the hard-left Left Party gaining up to 9% of the vote, while the pro-business Free Democrats faced potential exclusion from parliament. As Germany navigates a complex political environment, Merz emphasized the urgency of establishing a viable government.
