## Article summary
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has finalized an agreement to share tax information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) regarding some immigrants without legal status. This significant change allows ICE to request information about individuals who have final orders of removal or are under criminal investigation. The memorandum of understanding was signed on April 8, 2025, though the timeline for when information-sharing will commence remains unclear. The agreement is framed as a means to support law enforcement in combating illegal immigration, but it has raised concerns among immigrant advocates. Critics argue that this move threatens the safety of undocumented workers and may discourage tax compliance, as many rely on the confidentiality of their tax information. Despite opposition from congressional Democrats and advocacy groups, the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have proceeded with the deal, citing legal provisions that allow for exceptions in criminal investigations. The Treasury Department maintains its commitment to taxpayer confidentiality while also emphasizing its obligation to pursue criminal activity. Immigrants without legal status contribute significantly to tax revenues, and fears of exposure to deportation could lead to reduced tax filings. The agreement's implications for immigrant communities and federal revenue are still unfolding.
