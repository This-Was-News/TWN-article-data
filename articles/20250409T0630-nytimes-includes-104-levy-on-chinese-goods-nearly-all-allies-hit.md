## Article summary
President Trump's recent tariffs have raised import taxes on Chinese goods to over 100%, prompting China to retaliate with its own levies. This escalation has heightened global economic concerns, with stock markets experiencing significant declines and government bond yields rising. Many countries, including Taiwan and Vietnam, are seeking negotiations with the Trump administration to avoid the tariffs, while the European Union is preparing its retaliatory measures. In China, factory owners express anxiety over canceled American orders and potential drops in consumer confidence. The effects of the tariffs are also felt in India's pharmaceutical sector, which is facing new tariffs after previously being exempted. Analysts warn that the scale of the tariffs may severely impact China's export sector, with fears of a global recession looming. South Korea is attempting to balance its response, negotiating with the U.S. while supporting its struggling automakers. Meanwhile, the Philippines sees an opportunity to attract businesses seeking alternatives to China due to the tariffs. The overall sentiment reflects a precarious situation, with potential long-term consequences for global trade and economic stability.
