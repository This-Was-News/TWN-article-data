## Article summary
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, announced that the Department of Health and Human Services will now require new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled studies before approval. This decision has raised concerns among vaccine experts, who fear it could delay the availability of new vaccines, particularly updates to COVID-19 vaccines. Critics argue that this requirement represents a significant shift from established practices and could undermine public confidence in vaccinations. Experts like Dr. Paul Offit and Dr. Peter Hotez express alarm, suggesting that the new policy may make vaccines more expensive and less accessible. They also dispute the claim that prior vaccines were not tested against placebos, noting that standard testing protocols have typically included such trials. The administration defends the new requirement as a move towards increased transparency and safety, asserting that many vaccines lack adequate risk profile data. However, experts warn that implementing placebo trials could be unethical, especially when effective vaccines already exist. The potential for lengthy and costly trials could hinder timely responses to ongoing public health challenges, such as COVID-19 and measles outbreaks. Overall, the announcement has sparked a heated debate about vaccine safety, efficacy, and public health policy.
