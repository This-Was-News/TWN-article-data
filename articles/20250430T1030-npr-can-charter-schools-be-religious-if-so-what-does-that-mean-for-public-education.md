## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a significant case that may determine whether charter schools can be religious and receive public funding. The case centers around St. Isidore of Seville Catholic School, which sought to establish a virtual charter school in Oklahoma, but was blocked by the Oklahoma Supreme Court due to constitutional concerns about public funding of religious institutions. Proponents argue that denying religious organizations access to charter schools constitutes discrimination, asserting that parents should have the choice to send their children to such institutions. However, the state contends that allowing religious charter schools violates the First Amendment, which prohibits the establishment of religion.

The case has broader implications for public education, as it raises questions about the nature of religious liberty and taxpayer-funded education. The Oklahoma Attorney General warns that permitting religious charter schools could lead to funding for a variety of religious ideologies, not just Christianity. The court's decision could hinge on a tie vote, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett has recused herself due to potential conflicts of interest, which would uphold the existing ruling against religious charter schools. Overall, the outcome could reshape the landscape of public education in the United States.
