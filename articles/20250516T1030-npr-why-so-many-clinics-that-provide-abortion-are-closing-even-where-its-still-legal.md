## Article summary
The closure of abortion clinics, including four Planned Parenthood centers in Michigan, is driven by financial pressures despite the legality of abortion in those states. The Marquette clinic, which served 1,100 patients annually, is now nearly five hours away from the nearest facility. In the past year, at least 34 clinics have closed in legal states, highlighting a trend where operational and financial challenges threaten access to care more than legal restrictions. Experts note that rising costs, low reimbursement rates, and increased demand for telehealth services contribute to this issue. While telehealth offers some advantages, it cannot fully replace the need for in-person care, especially in rural areas with limited internet access.

Many patients are delaying care due to rising costs, exacerbating the situation, as clinics report decreased patient volumes and revenue. Planned Parenthood's national federation faces criticism for prioritizing policy efforts over direct patient care, leading to staff cuts without reducing executive pay. Although telehealth services are expanding, healthcare providers express concern that this model cannot adequately meet the needs of vulnerable populations. Local healthcare professionals are strategizing to fill gaps left by clinic closures, but the loss of established care systems poses significant challenges for patient access. Overall, the situation reflects a complex interplay of financial sustainability and the ongoing need for reproductive health services.
