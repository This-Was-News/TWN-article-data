Anil Ambalal Patel, a 60-year-old widower, lost his son Harshit and daughter-in-law Pooja in the Air India Flight 171 crash, which took 240 lives. The couple had moved to Britain for better opportunities and were visiting Patel when they decided to return. Patel, who had faced numerous hardships, including his wife's death from cancer, found joy in his son's family. The crash not only took his loved ones but also dashed his dreams of economic mobility and familial unity. After a grueling wait, Patel performed the final rites for Harshit and Pooja, scattering their ashes in the Narmada River, and now faces a future filled with loneliness and uncertainty.
