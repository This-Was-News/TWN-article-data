## Article summary
Senator Chuck Schumer is facing significant backlash from Democrats after he voted with Republicans on a stopgap spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. While Schumer defended his decision as a way to protect his party members from difficult votes and long-term consequences, many Democrats, including House leaders and progressive activists, criticized him for what they see as a capitulation to Republican pressure. Protests erupted outside his Brooklyn home, and some party members suggested he should step aside from leadership, citing feelings of betrayal. 

Schumer argued that a government shutdown could lead to severe cuts that would harm essential programs, emphasizing the need to focus on larger fights against Republican tax cuts for the wealthy. Despite the criticism, some Senate Democrats privately acknowledged his leadership role in navigating a tough political situation. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi also expressed disapproval of Schumer's decision, highlighting a false choice presented by Trump and Musk regarding the funding bill. 

As tensions rise within the party, Schumer remains resolute in his strategy, believing that avoiding a shutdown is in the best interest of his members and constituents. He indicated that the criticism he faces is part of the job and pledged to continue fighting for Democratic priorities in the future.
