## Article summary
House Republicans have introduced a 99-page stopgap funding bill aimed at preventing a government shutdown, which is set to occur soon. The proposed legislation would fund the government until September 30 and includes a slight increase in defense spending while reducing non-defense expenditures. However, the GOP faces challenges in garnering sufficient votes due to narrow margins in the House and Senate, potentially requiring Democratic support. President Trump has expressed his backing for the bill, urging Republicans to unite in support of the plan. 

Despite some Republican members previously opposing such stopgap measures, a shift in perspective has emerged, with a few now willing to support the bill under specific conditions. Conversely, Democrats have signaled their reluctance to support the GOP's plan, criticizing it as a power grab that undermines negotiations for comprehensive fiscal year spending bills. House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro has voiced strong objections, emphasizing the need for full-year funding discussions. 

Even if the bill passes the House, it will still need support from at least seven Democratic senators to overcome the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. The situation remains fluid as the deadline approaches, with significant implications for government operations and funding.
