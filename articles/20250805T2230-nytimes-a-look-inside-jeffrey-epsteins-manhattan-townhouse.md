## Article summary
Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan townhouse, a seven-story mansion, served as a hub for elite gatherings, showcasing his connections with powerful figures like former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, media mogul Mortimer Zuckerman, and director Woody Allen. The mansion featured eccentric decor, including framed prosthetic eyeballs, a sculpture of a bride clutching a rope, and a first edition of "Lolita." Despite his status as a convicted sex offender, Epstein hosted influential guests, including Stephen K. Bannon, who conducted interviews there. The townhouse also harbored dark secrets, with hidden cameras and a massage room where Epstein allegedly assaulted young girls. Epstein's social network dwindled as his reputation became increasingly tarnished, ultimately leading to his death in custody in 2019 while awaiting federal sex-trafficking charges.
