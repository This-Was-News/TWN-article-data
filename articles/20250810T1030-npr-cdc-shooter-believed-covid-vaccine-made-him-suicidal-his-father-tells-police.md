## Article summary
A 30-year-old man opened fire at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer. The shooter, identified as Patrick Joseph White, blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his depression and suicidal thoughts, according to his father. White was armed with five guns and fired dozens of rounds before being stopped by guards at the CDC. The incident left multiple buildings damaged and employees in lockdown for hours. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his skepticism of vaccines, expressed support for CDC employees but faced criticism from former employees who blame him for fueling hostility towards the agency. The shooter's neighbor reported that he often expressed distrust in COVID-19 vaccines. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of CDC employees, with some calling for a security assessment and removal of identifiable parking decals. The shooter's motives remain under investigation, with authorities yet to confirm whether he was killed by police or took his own life.
