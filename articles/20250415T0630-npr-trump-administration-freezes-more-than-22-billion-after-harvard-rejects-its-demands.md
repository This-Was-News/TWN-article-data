## Article summary
The Trump administration has frozen more than $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts to Harvard University following the school's refusal to comply with government demands regarding its hiring, admissions, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that no government should dictate the educational policies of private universities. The demands included eliminating DEI initiatives and screening international students for extremist views. The government's response emphasized the need for elite universities to uphold civil rights laws if they wish to continue receiving federal support. Harvard's rejection of the demands was framed as a defense of its First Amendment rights. The administration's actions are part of a broader campaign against major universities, targeting alleged civil rights violations and DEI programs. Other institutions, such as Columbia, Cornell, and Northwestern, have also faced funding cuts for similar reasons. Harvard has outlined its efforts to address antisemitism on campus, asserting that the government's demands overstep legal boundaries. The situation raises significant concerns about the balance of federal influence over educational institutions and the implications for academic freedom.
