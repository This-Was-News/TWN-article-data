## Article summary
Elon Musk criticized President Trump's major domestic policy bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" and warning that it would significantly increase the federal deficit. Musk's remarks highlight a growing rift between him and Trump, as he previously supported the administration. The bill, which aims to cut taxes primarily benefiting the wealthy while reducing funding for health and education programs, has faced opposition from fiscal conservatives within the Republican Party. Despite Trump's push for rapid passage, some GOP senators are seeking modifications due to concerns about its impact on national debt. Musk's critique has resonated with Democrats, who see it as validation of their concerns about the legislation's fiscal implications. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson expressed disappointment in Musk's comments, emphasizing the bill's intended benefits. Musk, who previously contributed significantly to Republican campaigns, indicated he would scale back his financial support in future elections. His criticism coincided with a broader debate within the GOP about spending priorities and debt management. As the Senate prepares to review the bill, divisions among Republicans could complicate its passage. Musk's influence and financial backing remain a point of concern for some GOP members facing potential primary challenges.
