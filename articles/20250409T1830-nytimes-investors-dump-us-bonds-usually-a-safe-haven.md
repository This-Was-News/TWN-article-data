## Article summary
The recent sell-off in U.S. government bonds and the dollar has raised concerns about the United States' status as a safe haven for investors amid escalating trade tensions stemming from President Trump's tariffs. Following a pause in tariff implementation, yields on 10-year Treasuries rose to 4.35%, while short-term bonds saw significant increases in yields. This volatility has led investors to consider alternative safe havens, such as German bonds and gold, as demand for U.S. assets wanes. Experts express concerns that the U.S. is being viewed similarly to emerging markets, with fears of a potential financial crisis linked to tariff policies. The weakening dollar contradicts expectations of appreciation due to tariffs, raising inflation concerns for American consumers. Some analysts warn that ongoing trade restrictions could extend to capital flows, further destabilizing investor confidence. Despite reassurances from officials, the long-term impact of these policies on the demand for U.S. assets remains uncertain, with predictions of lasting damage to the dollar's supremacy. Overall, the situation reflects a significant shift in how the global market perceives U.S. economic stability.
