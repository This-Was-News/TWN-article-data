## Article summary
The Episcopal Church is ending its nearly 40-year partnership with the U.S. government for refugee resettlement, primarily due to a request from the Trump administration to prioritize the resettlement of white Afrikaners from South Africa. Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe emphasized the church's commitment to racial justice, stating that it is morally unacceptable to resettle Afrikaners over other refugees who have been waiting for assistance. Rowe criticized the administration's claims that Afrikaners are facing genocide, asserting that such assertions lack evidence and that the church's values do not align with the current refugee policies. The church has a historical connection to the fight against apartheid in South Africa and has been involved in supporting racial equality. With the refugee resettlement program largely halted, Rowe expressed concern for those who have worked alongside U.S. military personnel and are now in danger. Following the end of the partnership, the church plans to redirect its efforts towards advocacy and support for vulnerable migrants without partnering with the federal government. Rowe highlighted the need for compassion and care for those in need, consistent with the church's mission.
