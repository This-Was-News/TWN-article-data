## Article summary
Catholic leaders have expressed criticism towards President Trump for posting an AI-generated image of himself dressed as the pope on social media. The image was shared shortly after Trump attended Pope Francis's funeral, who had recently passed away. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, stated that he hoped Trump was not involved with the image and deemed it inappropriate. The New York State Catholic Conference condemned the post, highlighting the solemnity surrounding the recent loss of Pope Francis and the upcoming papal conclave. Bishop Thomas John Paprocki labeled the image as mocking to God and the Catholic Church, calling for an apology from Trump. In response to the backlash, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Trump, noting his respect for Pope Francis and support for religious liberty. Vice President JD Vance commented on social media, distinguishing between acceptable humor and harmful actions. Trump's remarks about wanting to be pope earlier raised eyebrows, but he later clarified he had no preference for the next pope. Overall, the incident has sparked significant controversy among Catholic leaders and the broader community.
