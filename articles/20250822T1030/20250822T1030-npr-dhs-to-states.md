## Article summary
The Trump administration is threatening to withhold tens of millions of dollars in election security funding from states that do not comply with new voting policy requirements. The money is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant program, and officials say the new requirements make the funds inaccessible for most of the country. Maine is forgoing roughly $130,000 in election security grant money because it does not plan to comply with the new requirements. The new grant rules were released in late July and are seen by multiple election officials as a way for the administration to force policy changes. One requirement is that jurisdictions must 'prioritize compliance' with new federal guidelines for voting system certification, which are not yet incorporated anywhere in the country. Another requirement is the use of a new DHS citizenship verification tool for all poll workers, a system whose accuracy and reliability have not been publicly disclosed. The removal of language that explicitly banned using grant money for activities that could suppress voter registration or turnout has also raised concerns. Experts worry that the new requirements could endanger hundreds of millions of dollars in other grants for law enforcement. The potential withholding of funds over policy differences, combined with other recent election security cuts, has led many to question whether the Trump administration is prioritizing election security as it claims.
