## Article summary
President Trump has aggressively expanded his power since returning to office, overriding congressional spending decisions, dismissing leaders of independent agencies, and pushing legal and constitutional barriers on issues like immigration and birthright citizenship. He has also used government resources to retaliate against political and personal foes, initiating criminal investigations, demanding large payments, revoking security clearances, and dismissing federal employees. Trump's call for the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook marks a merging of his retaliatory tactics with an attempt to control the central bank, which is legally structured to maintain substantial independence from political influence. The move follows allegations by Bill Pule, a key Trump ally, that Cook falsified bank documents to obtain favorable mortgage terms. Trump's pressure campaign aims to install new Fed leaders who will lower interest rates, despite limited legal ability to remove Fed officials, who can only be dismissed for cause. Cook has refused to resign, stating she will not be bullied. This targeting fits a broader pattern of the Trump administration ousting independent government officials and invoking the unitary executive theory, which asserts nearly unchecked presidential authority. Experts warn that this unprecedented use of government power for retaliation threatens federal independence. Trump has also targeted other political foes, including Senator Adam Schiff and Letitia James, and has dismissed inspectors general and installed loyalists in the Justice Department. His administration has also sought to hold former President Barack Obama and his aides criminally liable for alleged interference in the 2016 election.
