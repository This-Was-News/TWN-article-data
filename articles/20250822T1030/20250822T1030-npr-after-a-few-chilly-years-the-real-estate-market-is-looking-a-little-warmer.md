## Article summary
The real estate market is showing slight improvement after a few chilly years. Sales of existing homes rose 2% in July compared to the previous month, with about 4 million homes expected to be sold this year, though this is lower than pre-pandemic levels. Inventory has increased significantly, with 1.55 million units for sale, a 16% rise from a year ago, benefiting buyers with more options and negotiation power. Home prices are softening in many markets, with declines in 33 of the 50 largest metro areas, although the national median price remains high at $422,400. High prices and mortgage rates, averaging 6.6%, continue to deter buyers. However, a slight drop in mortgage rates has spurred refinance activity. The Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cut in mid-September could further influence mortgage rates, but economic concerns may keep them elevated. The 'lock-in' effect, where homeowners stay due to low mortgage rates, is easing as more people are moving and listing their homes. New home construction shows mixed signals, with housing starts up 5% but building permits down nearly 3%, highlighting affordability challenges and labor shortages.
