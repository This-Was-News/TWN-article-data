## Article summary
President Trump's efforts to control the Federal Reserve and Bureau of Labor Statistics pose significant risks to the U.S. economy's stability and reputation. Historically, the U.S. economy has been a safe haven for investors due to its reliable institutions and predictable policies. Trump's actions, including firing officials and pressuring agencies, threaten this trust. Economists warn that undermining the Fed's independence could lead to higher inflation, while meddling with economic statistics could increase government borrowing costs. Cutting research funding could also harm long-term economic growth. Collectively, these actions risk eroding the U.S.'s reputation as a stable and reliable place to do business. The interdependence of economic institutions, such as the Fed and statistical agencies, is crucial for maintaining investor confidence. Trump's attempts to influence these institutions could lead to higher borrowing costs and economic instability. While immediate impacts may not be severe, long-term damage could be significant. The administration's broader efforts to control various agencies and research funding further exacerbate these risks, potentially leading to economic inefficiency and instability.
