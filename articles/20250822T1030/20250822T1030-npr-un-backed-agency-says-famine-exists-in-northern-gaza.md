## Article summary
A U.N.-backed panel has confirmed that famine exists in northern Gaza, with over half a million people at risk of starvation and hundreds of thousands more facing catastrophic shortages. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report describes the situation as a 'race against time,' warning that at least 132,000 children under five could die from acute malnutrition in the coming months. The famine, declared as the most extreme classification of hunger, is occurring in Gaza Governorate and is projected to spread to other areas by the end of September. The crisis has been attributed to deliberate restrictions on aid, destruction of infrastructure, and relentless bombardment. Israel has denied the existence of famine, accusing the IPC of publishing a biased report. Meanwhile, international organizations have accused Israel of weaponizing aid to achieve its aims in Gaza. The U.N. Secretary-General has condemned the situation as a man-made disaster and a moral indictment. Despite efforts to deliver aid, the situation remains desperate, with public order breaking down and the social fabric of Gaza collapsing as the fear of starvation intensifies.
