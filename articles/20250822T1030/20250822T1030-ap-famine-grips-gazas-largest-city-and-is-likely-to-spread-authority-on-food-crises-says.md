## Article summary
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has declared a famine in Gaza City, Gaza Strip's largest city, warning that it could spread to other areas like Der al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month. This declaration follows months of warnings from aid groups about the severe hunger crisis caused by Israel's restrictions on food and military offensive. The IPC reports that over half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of the population, face catastrophic hunger levels, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes. Israel disputes these findings, claiming that reports of starvation are exaggerated and that significant steps have been taken to increase aid entering Gaza. However, the U.N. and Palestinians in Gaza assert that the aid received is insufficient. The IPC's determination of famine is based on specific criteria, including extreme food shortages, high rates of child malnutrition, and increased mortality rates due to starvation and disease. The conflict and blockade have made data collection difficult, but the available evidence supports the famine declaration. The IPC warns that a third of Gaza's population could face catastrophic hunger by the end of September. Experts argue that Israel's restrictions and military actions have exacerbated the hunger crisis, with a planned escalation in Gaza City expected to worsen the situation. The humanitarian impact includes rising numbers of malnourished patients and preventable deaths, particularly among children.
