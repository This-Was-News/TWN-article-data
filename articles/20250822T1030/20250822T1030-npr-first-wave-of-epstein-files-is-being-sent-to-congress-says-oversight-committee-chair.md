## Article summary
The House Oversight Committee is set to receive hundreds of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation starting on Friday, marking the first wave of files sent by the Justice Department in response to a congressional subpoena. Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., has stated that some of these documents will eventually be made public, emphasizing transparency. The handling of the Epstein case is a delicate issue for congressional Republicans, balancing demands for transparency with potential embarrassment regarding the government's handling of the investigation and President Trump's past associations with Epstein. Comer issued 11 subpoenas seeking DOJ files and testimony from high-profile witnesses, including Ghislane Maxwell, former President Bill Clinton, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Epstein died by suicide in prison six years ago this month while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, fueling conspiracy theories. The committee expects a substantial volume of documents, with Comer confident that there will be hundreds of pages to review. Critics, including some Republicans, worry the release will be incomplete, while Democrats argue it will be carefully controlled by Republicans. Additionally, efforts to release grand jury transcripts have been unsuccessful, with federal judges ruling against the plan. Congress is also planning to vote on releasing Epstein records, with a bipartisan effort led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif.
