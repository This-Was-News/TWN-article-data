## Article summary
Erik Menendez was denied parole by a California board due to his continued misbehavior in prison for the 1989 murders of his parents. The parole hearing, attended by family members advocating for his release, focused on his prison conduct and the severity of his crimes. Commissioners cited his repeated use of a cellphone and other rule violations as reasons for denial, despite his claims of transformation and remorse. Erik Menendez provided a detailed account of his upbringing and actions, but the panel scrutinized his prison record, including allegations of gang involvement and drug use. His attorney highlighted his positive changes since 2013, while commissioners noted his lack of a moral foundation and questionable choices. Family members, including his aunt, expressed forgiveness and support, but the board emphasized his ongoing risk to public safety. Lyle Menendez's parole hearing is scheduled for the following day. The brothers' case has garnered significant public attention, with documentaries and dramas bringing renewed interest. Their pending habeas corpus petition seeks a review of their convictions based on new evidence of alleged sexual abuse by their father.
