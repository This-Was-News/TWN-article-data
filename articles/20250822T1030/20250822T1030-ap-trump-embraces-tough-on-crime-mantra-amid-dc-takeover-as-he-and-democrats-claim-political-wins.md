## Article summary
President Donald Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., framing it as a response to a crime wave, despite crime rates declining since the pandemic. Trump views this as a political win, while Democrats criticize it as a stunt to distract from issues like inflation and healthcare. Maryland Governor Wes Moore, a veteran, condemns Trump's use of troops as a political pawn. The White House promotes the operation, sharing daily arrest statistics, including those of undocumented immigrants. Trump defends his actions, claiming they have reduced crime and received support even from Democrats. The White House aims to use D.C. as a test case for similar interventions in other cities, though Trump's legal authority is limited outside D.C. Democratic leaders highlight their success in reducing crime and accuse Trump of stoking racial division. Recent polls show Republicans leading on crime and policing issues, but concerns about presidential overreach have grown. The military presence in D.C. has caused disruption, with schools and daycare centers affected. Governor Moore vows to block any attempt to send troops to Baltimore, dismissing Trump's political motivations.
