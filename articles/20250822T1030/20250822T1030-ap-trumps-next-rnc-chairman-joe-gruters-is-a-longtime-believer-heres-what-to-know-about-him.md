Joe Gruters, a Florida conservative and longtime Donald Trump supporter, is set to become the next Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman. Gruters' rise reflects Trump's preference for loyalists and his increasing control over the party machinery. Gruters has been a steadfast Trump ally since 2012, playing key roles in Trump's campaigns and Florida's Republican Party. His support helped Trump win Florida in 2016 and 2020, despite Trump's election denial claims. Gruters' appointment as RNC chairman will strengthen Trump's influence over party fundrasing and election mechanics. As chairman, Gruters will help shape the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential primary process, ensuring Trump's continued impact on Republican politics.
