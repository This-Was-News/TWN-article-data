## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has hired Jonathan Gross, a lawyer known for his outspoken defense of January 6 defendants and his controversial comparisons of their prosecutions to the Holocaust. Gross, who previously lacked criminal law experience, has been working with the Trump administration's 'Weaponization Working Group.' Former Justice Department officials have expressed concerns about his hiring, citing his inflammatory rhetoric and limited background in criminal law. Gross has advocated for financial compensation for January 6 defendants and has shared conspiracy theories about the attack. He has also criticized prosecutors and judges involved in the cases, calling them 'evil people' and comparing them to Nazi war criminals. Despite his lack of experience, Gross has represented several January 6 defendants, some of whom have received presidential pardons. His hiring has raised questions about the direction of the DOJ under the Trump administration.
