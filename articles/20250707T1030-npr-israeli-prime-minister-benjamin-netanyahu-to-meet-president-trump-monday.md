## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet President Trump at the White House to discuss a potential ceasefire deal for Gaza. This marks Netanyahu's first visit since a collaborative attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The meeting follows a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, with a focus on ending Israel's ongoing war with Hamas, which began in October 2023 after Hamas's attack on Israeli communities. Trump announced a proposed 60-day ceasefire, contingent on Hamas releasing hostages, while Hamas expressed a tentative willingness to negotiate. Negotiations are complicated by Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war, which Israel has rejected. The ceasefire talks involve mediators from Qatar, the U.S., and Egypt, with an Israeli delegation in Doha aiming to address Hamas's demands. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties, with over 56,000 Palestinians reported killed and a growing Israeli public pressure to conclude the war. The regional dynamics have shifted dramatically, with Hezbollah's involvement and international backlash against Israel intensifying amid accusations of genocide. Despite military successes against Iran and its allies, Israel faces increasing diplomatic isolation.
