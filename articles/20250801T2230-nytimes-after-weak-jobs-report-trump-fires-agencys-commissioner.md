## Article summary
President Trump announced the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erka McEntarfer, after a disappointing jobs report showed weaker-than-expected job growth and significant downward revisions for May and June. Trump accused McEntarfer, without evidence, of rigging the data to make Republicans and himself look bad, while his administration and allies echoed these concerns. The weak jobs report, coupled with Trump's new tariffs on various countries, led to a sharp decline in stock markets and a drop in Treasury yields, increasing expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The Federal Reserve announced that Governor Adriana D. Kugler would step down early, giving Trump the opportunity to appoint a new governor who could eventually replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The document also highlights the economic impact of Trump's tariffs, including rising costs for farmers, consumers, and manufacturers, as well as the potential for retaliatory measures from trading partners.
