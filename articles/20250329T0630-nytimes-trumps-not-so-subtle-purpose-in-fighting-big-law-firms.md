## Article summary
The article discusses former President Trump's aggressive stance against major law firms, particularly those he perceives as political adversaries. He has initiated over 150 lawsuits against his administration, leading to court orders that challenge his policies. In response, Trump has issued executive orders limiting law firms' interactions with the federal government and directed the attorney general to seek sanctions against those filing what he deems frivolous lawsuits. This strategy aims to dissuade lawyers from taking on cases against his administration, potentially undermining citizens' rights to challenge government actions. 

Some law firms have responded by suing to block these orders, while others have struck deals with Trump to avoid penalties. The article highlights the chilling effect these actions may have on legal representation, particularly for pro bono cases. It also notes the irony of Trump, a Republican, targeting litigation that has historically been used by conservatives to contest government regulations. While Trump has criticized law firms for their perceived liberal bias, he has not targeted firms like Jones Day, which has ties to his administration. Overall, Trump's actions reflect a broader trend of constraining civic institutions and legal challenges to his presidency.
