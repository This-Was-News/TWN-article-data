## Article summary
President Trump's recent address to Congress was marked by a boastful and partisan tone, lasting nearly 100 minutes, making it the longest such speech in modern history. He emphasized his administration's "commonsense revolution" and praised Elon Musk's initiatives while appealing primarily to his MAGA supporters, dismissing Democrats with derogatory terms. Trump's focus on controversial topics, such as immigration and cultural issues, overshadowed economic concerns, despite rising prices being a significant issue for voters. Throughout the speech, he made numerous inaccurate claims, including exaggerated statistics regarding Social Security and tariffs. Key legislative asks included increased funding for deportations and tax cuts, highlighting his agenda for the coming year. The speech featured some theatrical moments, including the announcement of various honors and actions. In response, Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin delivered a noteworthy counter-address, emphasizing the importance of the middle class and cautioning against reckless changes. Her poised delivery contrasted sharply with the chaotic reactions from some Democrats during Trump's speech. Overall, the address reflected the deep partisan divide in the current political landscape.
