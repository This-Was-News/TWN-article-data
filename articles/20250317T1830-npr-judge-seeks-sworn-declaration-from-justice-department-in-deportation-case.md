## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Justice Department to provide a sworn declaration regarding the deportation of alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, despite his previous order to halt the deportations. Judge James Boasberg's emergency directive aimed to stop the use of wartime powers for immediate deportations and required planes in transit to return to the U.S. The case arose after over 250 individuals were deported, prompting civil rights groups to challenge the legality of the actions taken under the Alien Enemies Act. The Justice Department argued that the judge's order arrived too late to prevent the deportations, as some planes were already outside U.S. territory. However, the plaintiffs contend that an oral order issued by the judge prior to the written order should have been adhered to, as it directed the immediate return of the planes. The civil rights groups expressed concerns that the government may have violated the court's command regarding custody of the deportees. The issue of whether an oral order holds the same weight as a written one is also under legal scrutiny. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that the administration is seeking clarification on this matter in court. The situation highlights the complexities surrounding immigration enforcement and judicial authority.
