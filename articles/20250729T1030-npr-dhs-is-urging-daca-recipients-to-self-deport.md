## Article summary
The Trump administration is urging DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, to self-deport, despite the program offering temporary protection from deportation and work permits. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated that DACA does not confer legal status and that recipients may still be subject to arrest and deportation, particularly if they commit crimes. Recent actions, such as making DACA recipients ineligible for federal healthcare and investigating universities offering financial aid to them, have raised concerns about the administration's stance on the program. Immigrant advocates argue that these actions undermine DACA's protections and create fear among recipients, who have been detained or deported in various incidents. Despite public support for creating a legal pathway for DACA recipients, the administration's mixed messaging and strict enforcement have left many Dreamers uncertain about their future in the U.S.
