## Article summary
A top House Democrat, Gerry Connolly, is calling for an investigation into DOGE's access to sensitive data at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) following concerns raised by NPR reporting. Connolly's letter to the Acting Inspector General of the Department of Labor and the NLRB's Inspector General highlights potential "technological malfeasance" by DOGE, which may have engaged in illegal activities. Whistleblower disclosures indicate that DOGE staff attempted to exfiltrate and alter sensitive information, including corporate secrets and union-related data. 

Concerns were amplified by the fact that DOGE's leader, Elon Musk, has ongoing cases before the NLRB. The whistleblower reported significant data transfer, amounting to around 10 gigabytes, which included protected information as per federal laws. The letter requests answers regarding DOGE's access to NLRB networks and the nature of its activities within those systems. 

Additionally, there are allegations that DOGE staff sought extensive permissions that allowed unrestricted access to read, copy, and alter data. Security measures were reportedly bypassed, including disabling controls to prevent unauthorized access. These actions have raised cybersecurity and privacy concerns, prompting scrutiny in federal courts regarding DOGE's data access practices.
