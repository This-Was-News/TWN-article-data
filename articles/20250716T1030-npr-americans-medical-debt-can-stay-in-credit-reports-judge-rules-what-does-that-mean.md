## Article summary
A federal judge has ruled that medical debt can remain on Americans' credit reports, overturning a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule aimed at removing medical bills from credit reports. The CFPB had argued that medical debt is not a reliable indicator of a borrower's likelihood to default on loans, and its inclusion in credit reports could unfairly impact individuals' financial futures. However, the judge agreed with the Cornerstone Credit Union League's argument that the CFPB's rule exceeded its authority. Advocacy groups have criticized the ruling, while the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA) supports it, stating that medical debt information is crucial for assessing a consumer's ability to pay. The issue remains controversial, with congressional Republicans and figures like Elon Musk opposing the CFPB's efforts to remove medical debt from credit reports.
