## Article summary
President Trump has criticized Vladimir Putin, labeling him "absolutely crazy" after Russia's latest missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, which resulted in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries. Expressing his disapproval, Trump stated that Putin's actions are killing many people and indicated he would consider imposing more sanctions on Russia. The Ukrainian Air Force described the assault as the largest aerial attack of the ongoing war, with 355 drones and nine cruise missiles targeting various cities, including Kyiv. The Kremlin responded to Trump's comments by attributing them to "emotional overload" and expressed gratitude for his previous efforts to facilitate negotiations. Despite a recent prisoner exchange between the two nations, there has been little progress towards a ceasefire, as Putin rejected a proposed unconditional 30-day ceasefire from the U.S. Trump warned that Putin has ambitions for all of Ukraine, suggesting such actions could lead to Russia's downfall. Additionally, he criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urging him to stop making statements that create problems. Overall, Trump's remarks reflect a strong condemnation of both Putin's aggression and Zelenskyy's communications.
