## Article summary
As measles cases surge in the U.S., particularly in West Texas, health experts emphasize the importance of vaccination for both children and adults. Measles is highly contagious, and with declining kindergarten vaccination rates, more communities are at risk. While children are typically targeted for vaccination, some adults may also need a booster. Those particularly at risk include adults born after 1957 who were vaccinated before 1968, as early vaccines were less effective. The CDC recommends these individuals receive at least one dose of the current live attenuated vaccine.

Additionally, adults vaccinated between 1968 and 1989 may also benefit from a second dose, especially if they are in high-risk groups such as college students, healthcare workers, or travelers to areas with outbreaks. Adults over 20 are more susceptible to severe complications from measles, including pneumonia and brain swelling. With vaccination rates falling below the 95% threshold needed to prevent outbreaks, experts stress the critical nature of immunization to protect both children and adults from the disease.
