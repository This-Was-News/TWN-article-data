## Article summary
President Trump announced he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, providing economic support to a nation ravaged by civil war and dictatorship. This decision coincided with his first meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, in Saudi Arabia. The lifting of sanctions was met with public celebration in Syria, where many hope it will alleviate poverty and allow for reconstruction. Al-Shara, who led the rebellion against Bashar al-Assad, welcomed the move as a new beginning for the country. Trump attributed his decision to discussions with Turkey's President Erdogan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as he seeks to increase Saudi investment in the U.S. 

The sanctions were originally imposed due to the Assad regime's violent response to protests that escalated into civil war. Critics argue that lifting these sanctions is essential for international aid and investment to help Syria recover. While European leaders have shown interest in easing their sanctions, U.S. skepticism remains regarding al-Shara's intentions and his Islamist background. Nevertheless, regional leaders have pushed for U.S. engagement to prevent further instability. The announcement marks a significant shift in U.S. policy towards Syria, potentially paving the way for the country's reintegration into the global economy.
