## Article summary
The Trump administration is significantly expanding its access to sensitive data held by states, particularly for immigration enforcement purposes, raising legal and privacy concerns. The Department of Agriculture has instructed states to provide personal information about recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), threatening federal funding if they do not comply. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also issued subpoenas for personal data on noncitizens. An executive order aimed at eliminating "information silos" has facilitated this data consolidation across federal agencies, raising alarms about potential misuse and surveillance. Privacy advocates warn that such data aggregation could lead to broader government surveillance capabilities. Recent transfers of Medicaid data from several states to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have sparked outrage from state officials who argue this violates privacy laws. Many states are now grappling with how to respond to federal requests, balancing compliance with privacy protections. Critics assert that this approach undermines trust in public assistance programs and could deter vulnerable populations from seeking necessary benefits. Legal challenges against these data-sharing practices are ongoing, and states are considering the implications of federal funding threats versus the protection of sensitive information. The situation reflects a contentious intersection of immigration policy and data privacy in the current administration.
