## Article summary
A Delta Air Lines passenger plane and an Air Force jet narrowly avoided a collision outside Washington, D.C., prompting air traffic controllers to issue corrective instructions. The incident occurred on March 29, 2025, as Delta Flight 2983 was taking off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, bound for Minneapolis. The flight crew received a warning from the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) due to the proximity of the military aircraft, which was part of a formation en route for a flyover at Arlington National Cemetery. 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the close call, which follows a recent fatal collision involving an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter at the same airport. In light of safety concerns, the FAA had previously announced plans to limit helicopter flights near DCA. The NTSB reported numerous close calls in the area, indicating a significant safety issue with the flight patterns. 

Senator Amy Klobuchar expressed her alarm over the incident, questioning the safety protocols regarding military aircraft operating near commercial flights. Delta confirmed that its crew adhered to all safety instructions, emphasizing the importance of customer safety. The Air Force has yet to comment on the situation.
