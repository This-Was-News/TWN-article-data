## Article summary
Jeanine Pirro, a prominent Fox News host, has transitioned from her role on _The Five_ to become the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., following her appointment by President Trump. This move marks her as the 23rd Fox personality to join the Trump administration, highlighting the ongoing trend of Fox News figures entering high-ranking government positions. The phenomenon, referred to as the "Fox-to-Trump Funnel," has seen more Fox alumni in the administration during Trump's second term than in his first. Pirro, who previously served as a county judge and district attorney, has a long-standing relationship with Trump, having previously run for the U.S. Senate in 2006.

Throughout her career at Fox, Pirro has been known for her tough stance on crime and her vocal support for Trump, especially during his impeachment trials. She faced controversy, including being suspended for comments about Rep. Ilhan Omar's hijab and amplifying conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Following the election, her show was pulled from the air due to concerns over her responsibility on live television. Despite these issues, Trump has praised her work at Fox, emphasizing her high-profile status. With her appointment, Trump continues to consolidate influence from media personalities into his administration, as seen with other former Fox hosts now holding significant roles.
