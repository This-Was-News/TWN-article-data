## Article summary
Pam Bondi, the U.S. Attorney General, has taken a notably performative approach since her appointment, aligning closely with President Trump's directives and prioritizing tasks that cater to his MAGA base. Her handling of the Epstein files, intended to unveil new details about Jeffrey Epstein, was met with disappointment and criticism, reflecting her struggle to meet expectations. Unlike her predecessors, Bondi operates under a framework that emphasizes loyalty to the White House rather than institutional independence. She has been accused of lacking autonomy, with decisions increasingly made by Trump’s advisers rather than her own office. Despite her efforts to promote a law-and-order agenda, Bondi has faced backlash from both right and left factions, particularly for not taking a harder stance against Trump’s perceived enemies. Her public appearances, especially on Fox News, have become a significant part of her strategy, focusing on defending Trump’s policies and attacking opponents. Bondi’s tenure has also seen her involved in controversial decisions, including a shift in the department's focus away from traditional law enforcement priorities. Overall, her role highlights a departure from the Justice Department's historical autonomy, raising ethical concerns and questions about her effectiveness as Attorney General.
