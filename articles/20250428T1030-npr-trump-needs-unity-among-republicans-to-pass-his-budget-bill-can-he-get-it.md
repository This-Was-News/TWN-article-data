## Article summary
The article discusses the challenges facing President Trump as he seeks unity among Republicans to pass a significant budget bill. Following a two-week recess, Congress is tasked with turning Trump's domestic policy agenda into a multi-trillion dollar package that includes tax cuts, increased Pentagon funding, and border security spending. Despite Republican control of both chambers, internal disagreements complicate consensus on key elements of the plan, particularly regarding spending cuts. 

House committees are directed to cut at least $1.5 trillion, while Senate leaders propose a minimum of $4 billion, leading to tensions within the party. A major sticking point is potential cuts to Medicaid, with some Republicans opposing any reductions. Speaker Mike Johnson aims to have the legislation ready for Trump's signature by Memorial Day, but time constraints and the need to raise the debt ceiling add pressure. 

The article highlights the complexity of balancing fiscal responsibility with the demands of party members and the public. It also notes Trump's increased involvement in negotiations, which may influence lawmakers' decisions as they navigate these challenges. Ultimately, the ability to unite the party is crucial for the successful passage of the budget bill.
