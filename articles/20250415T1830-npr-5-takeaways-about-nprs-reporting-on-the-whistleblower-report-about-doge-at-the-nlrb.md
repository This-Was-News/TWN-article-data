## Article summary
NPR's reporting on a whistleblower's allegations regarding DOGE at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reveals serious concerns about data security and access. The whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, claims that DOGE employees sought unauthorized access to sensitive labor data, potentially compromising employee privacy and proprietary business information. Despite the NLRB's denial of granting access, Berulis's disclosures indicate that DOGE's actions included disabling security protocols and manipulating data access controls, raising significant red flags among cybersecurity experts. 

The NxGen case management system, which houses critical information about labor disputes and union activities, is especially sensitive, and its exposure could negatively impact organized labor. Experts worry that unrestricted access to this data could facilitate retaliation against union organizers and compromise ongoing investigations involving companies owned by Elon Musk. The whistleblower's claims highlight a pattern of DOGE seeking sensitive data without proper safeguards, which has drawn scrutiny in numerous federal lawsuits. 

Overall, the implications of DOGE's access to NLRB data are concerning for both individual workers and the integrity of labor relations in the U.S.
