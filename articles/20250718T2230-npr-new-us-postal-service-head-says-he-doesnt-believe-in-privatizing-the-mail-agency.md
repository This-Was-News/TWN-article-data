## Article summary
Postmaster General David Steiner has publicly stated that he does not support privatizing the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or making it a federally appropriated entity, advocating instead for its current self-financing, independent structure. Steiner, who previously held roles at Waste Management and FedEx, addressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest related to his past investments, with USPS stating that these issues are being resolved. Despite Steiner's assurances, some union leaders remain cautious, emphasizing that actions will ultimately determine their support. Steiner acknowledged the USPS' progress in adopting private-sector logistics practices but indicated a willingness to assess and modify the agency's approach to better serve employees and customers. The USPS has raised stamp prices, including a recent 7% increase for first-class "forever" stamps, to help stabilize its finances amid declining mail volumes and legal obligations.
