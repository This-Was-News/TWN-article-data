## Article summary
The Trump administration has proposed significant budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), aiming to reduce its funding by over 25% from its current $6 billion budget. The cuts would severely impact NOAA's research operations and fisheries services, particularly eliminating the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) and slashing funding for climate and weather research by nearly 75%. This proposal echoes themes from Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint advocating for a downsizing of NOAA. Critics, including former NOAA officials, warn that such drastic reductions would regress scientific capabilities to levels not seen since the 1950s, jeopardizing vital weather forecasting and climate research.

The budget also seeks to reduce investments in NOAA's satellite technology by 44%, threatening the development of new satellites essential for weather data collection. While the National Weather Service's budget remains intact, the overall impact of these cuts could severely hinder NOAA's ability to provide lifesaving weather services. Additionally, recent firings of NOAA employees have raised concerns about the agency's capacity to operate effectively. Experts emphasize that cutting research funding is shortsighted and could have long-term detrimental effects on understanding climate change and managing fisheries resources.
