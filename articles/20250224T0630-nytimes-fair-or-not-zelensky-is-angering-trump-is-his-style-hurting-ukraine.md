## Article summary
The article examines whether President Volodymyr Zelensky's approach to former President Donald Trump is detrimental to Ukraine's interests. Despite Zelensky's effective wartime leadership, his style has reportedly alienated the Trump administration, leading to tensions rather than cooperation. Recently, Zelensky's request for a meeting with Trump to secure continued U.S. support was rebuffed, illustrating the friction between them. Critics argue that Zelensky's public corrections of Trump's statements have worsened relations, while some Ukrainians support his stance against perceived misinformation.

Zelensky's insistence on Ukraine's involvement in negotiations has frustrated Trump, who believes Zelensky's presence at meetings is unnecessary. This ongoing conflict may jeopardize American military aid, which is crucial for Ukraine. European leaders have advised Zelensky to adopt a more diplomatic tone, but he has not backed down from criticizing Trump. The article highlights a broader sentiment among Ukrainians who seek a voice in discussions that will shape their future, emphasizing the importance of their military's resistance against Russia. Ultimately, the article suggests that Zelensky's confrontational approach could hinder Ukraine's diplomatic efforts during a critical time.
