## Article summary
The article discusses the consequences of cuts to U.S. foreign aid, particularly by the Trump administration, which have severely undermined global health security and increased the risk of disease outbreaks. Organizations previously funded by the United States played a crucial role in managing dangerous pathogens worldwide, but many of these safeguards have been dismantled. The halting of foreign aid has particularly impacted programs that monitor and respond to outbreaks of diseases like mpox and Ebola, leaving populations more vulnerable, including Americans. 

Current and former officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.) express concerns that the lack of funding has led to a significant rise in infectious diseases, with estimates predicting thousands of new cases annually. The article highlights the dire situation in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where mpox cases are surging, and mentions ongoing crises like bird flu in the U.S. 

Additionally, the cuts have resulted in the termination of numerous health workers and experts, drastically reducing the capacity to respond to outbreaks. The article warns that the absence of U.S. leadership in global health could lead to a lack of coordination and increased risks of bioterrorism. Experts emphasize that the loss of funding and support not only jeopardizes health security in affected regions but also poses a threat to public health in the U.S. as outbreaks can quickly spread across borders. Overall, the article portrays a troubling picture of how foreign aid cuts are setting the stage for future health crises.
