## Article summary
DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, initiated a "survey of surveys" to potentially eliminate some U.S. government data collection efforts, bypassing the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB). A member of DOGE sent a detailed form to federal agencies, raising concerns about duplicating OMB's review process and possible violations of laws requiring statistical reporting. DOGE claims to have terminated five "wasteful" surveys but has not specified which ones. Critics argue that much of the information DOGE seeks is already publicly available and that the initiative threatens the integrity of federal statistical agencies. The push has sparked fears of legal noncompliance and undermining congressional oversight. Experts emphasize that decision-making authority over federal surveys should rest with statistical agency leaders, not external entities like DOGE. Calls for congressional review of DOGE's actions have emerged, highlighting concerns over transparency and the potential impact on the upcoming 2030 census. Staffing issues at the Census Bureau, exacerbated by the initiative, raise alarms about preparedness for future national counts. Overall, DOGE's efforts are seen as part of a broader trend to reduce federal data collection amid claims of inefficiency.
