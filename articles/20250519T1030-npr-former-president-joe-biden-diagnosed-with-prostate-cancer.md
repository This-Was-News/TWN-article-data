## Article summary
Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone. The diagnosis followed tests revealing a prostate nodule, with the cancer being assigned a Gleason score of 9, indicating its aggressive nature. Despite this, a statement from Biden's office noted that the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management, and Biden and his family are exploring treatment options. Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among U.S. men and is the most common cancer aside from non-melanoma skin cancer. Biden, who recently left office after his first term, had previously decided to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race. He had led the Cancer Moonshot initiative during his vice presidency and reignited it after becoming president to reduce cancer death rates. In response to the news, President Trump expressed his sadness and extended best wishes for Biden's recovery. Vice President Kamala Harris also shared her support, commending Biden's strength and resilience. Harris expressed hope for a full and speedy recovery for the former president.
