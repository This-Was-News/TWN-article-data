## Article summary
The article discusses the challenges House Republicans face in cutting $880 billion from the budget without significantly impacting Medicaid, which provides health coverage to 72 million Americans. Speaker Mike Johnson successfully got a budget resolution passed, but the Senate must also adopt it, and both chambers need to draft legislation that adheres to its directives. The budget resolution does not explicitly mandate Medicaid cuts but requires significant reductions from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health programs. 

Options for achieving these cuts are limited due to the reconciliation process, compelling Republicans to find savings within the committee's jurisdiction. Potential alternatives include cuts to Medicare, which Republicans are hesitant to pursue, or eliminating non-healthcare spending, which would still fall short of the required savings. Creative solutions, such as overturning regulations or auctioning airwave rights, may provide some savings but could be ruled out under budget process rules.

Ultimately, the article concludes that substantial cuts to health care, particularly Medicaid, are necessary to meet budget goals. The committee's instructions indicate that without major reforms or cuts to health programs, the entire reconciliation process could fail, jeopardizing efforts to extend tax cuts.
