## Article summary
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with firing probationary federal workers, reversing a lower court decision that had ordered the reinstatement of tens of thousands of employees. This ruling allows the administration to re-fire probationary employees, who are typically in their first or second year of service. The court's decision was made in a 2-to-1 vote, indicating that the Trump administration is likely to succeed in arguing that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the case brought by 19 states and the District of Columbia. While the court did not determine the legality of the firings, it is expected to review the case's merits in the coming weeks. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling that similarly vacated a lower court's order regarding six federal agencies. The outcomes represent setbacks for states and unions attempting to block the mass firings of over 24,000 federal workers. Many probationary employees have been reinstated to paid-leave or full duty status, while agencies are also exploring reorganization plans that may lead to further layoffs. The Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal workforce continue amidst these legal battles.
