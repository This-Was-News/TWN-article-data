## Article summary
Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is facing a significant defeat in the Upper House elections, with exit polls indicating a shift in voter support towards opposition parties, including new right-wing populist groups. The LDP, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has struggled with issues such as rising rice prices, immigration backlash, and potential U.S. tariffs. Despite the poor showing, Ishiba expressed his intention to continue as leader, but analysts suggest he may face internal party pressure to resign. The elections saw notable gains for two new nationalist parties, the Democratic Party for the People and Sanseito, which appealed to younger voters with populist policies. Voters expressed dissatisfaction with the LDP's policies, particularly the rising cost of staples like rice, and sought change to address economic concerns.
