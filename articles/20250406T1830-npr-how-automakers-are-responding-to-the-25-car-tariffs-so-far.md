## Article summary
The recent implementation of President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported cars has prompted immediate responses from automakers, including layoffs, production halts, and pauses in shipments. Stellantis announced temporary layoffs for 900 workers at several U.S. facilities due to production pauses in Mexico and Canada. Jaguar Land Rover has paused shipments to the U.S. while evaluating long-term strategies in light of the tariffs. Consumers are reacting by rushing to dealerships to make purchases before potential price increases, with Hyundai reporting record sales as buyers seek to avoid future costs. 

Some companies, like Ferrari and BMW, have committed to absorbing tariff costs temporarily, while others, like Ford and Nissan, have implemented price cuts to attract buyers. Market analysts predict that vehicle prices could rise significantly due to the tariffs, especially with an upcoming tariff on car parts set to take effect. As the industry navigates these changes, uncertainty remains about the long-term impacts on both production and consumer pricing. Overall, the tariffs are expected to raise car prices and alter the landscape of the automotive market.
