## Article summary
The ACLU, alongside other immigrant rights organizations, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent the transfer of migrants from the U.S. to Guantánamo Bay. The lawsuit argues that there is no legitimate reason for such transfers, as the U.S. has sufficient detention facilities domestically. It claims that the administration's actions aim to instill fear within the immigrant community and are both illegal and illogical, given the associated costs and logistical challenges. The legal action was initiated on behalf of ten migrants at risk of being sent to Guantánamo, who are currently detained in Texas, Arizona, and Virginia. Since Trump resumed office in January, over 200 migrants have already been sent to Guantánamo, with plans to hold them temporarily until they can be deported. The ACLU's lead counsel criticized the transfers as mere theatrics and emphasized the need to halt this "lawless project." Additionally, the ACLU has previously filed another lawsuit demanding that these migrants have access to legal representation. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet commented on the lawsuit.
