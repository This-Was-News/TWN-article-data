## Article summary
In Gaza, at least 325 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while trying to access food aid over the past week, with 24 deaths reported on Saturday alone. Despite Israel's claims of humanitarian pauses, food distribution remains perilous, with aid often looted by armed gangs and desperate crowds. International aid agencies and U.N. experts condemn Israel's restrictions on aid, calling them collective punishment and highlighting the worsening famine in Gaza. U.S. officials recently visited a food distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has faced criticism amid reports of violence near its locations. Meanwhile, hostage families in Tel Aviv protest for a ceasefire, and U.S. Jewish organizations provide aid to Christians in Gaza, including the restoration of a damaged church.
