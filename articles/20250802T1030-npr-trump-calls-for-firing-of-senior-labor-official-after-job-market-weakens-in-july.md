## Article summary
The U.S. labor market weakened significantly in late spring and early summer, with employers adding only 73,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate rising to 4.2%. President Trump responded by calling for the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating job numbers for political purposes. Data experts have raised concerns about the integrity of U.S. government statistics under the Trump administration, which has cut funding and positions for statistical agencies. The job market slowdown is attributed to factors like Trump's tariffs, which have created uncertainty and depressed orders, particularly in manufacturing. Despite the hiring slowdown, wages continue to rise, and the weakness in the job market may prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at its next policy meeting in September.
