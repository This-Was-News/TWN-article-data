## Article summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that children aged 6 months and older may receive Covid vaccines, contradicting Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s claims that healthy children do not need them. While many children experience mild Covid symptoms, some can become seriously ill, and over one million children in the U.S. have developed long Covid. The effectiveness of initial vaccinations in preventing severe illness is acknowledged, but the necessity of annual vaccines for children remains debated. Some experts argue that children have prolonged immune memory and may not need yearly shots, while others emphasize the waning protection against new variants. 

Data shows that children without underlying conditions can still face severe risks from Covid, with half of hospitalized children having no prior health issues. Vaccination is particularly recommended for children with underlying conditions and those living with high-risk individuals. Concerns about myocarditis associated with vaccines are noted, yet the risks from Covid itself are significantly higher. Additionally, vaccinating pregnant women is advised to protect infants, as they are at greater risk of hospitalization. Long Covid affects an estimated 1% of children, impacting their daily activities and health. Overall, the decision to vaccinate should be based on individual risk assessments by families.
