## Article summary
The article discusses how individuals who fled authoritarian regimes perceive similarities between the tactics of former President Trump and the oppressive methods used by the leaders of their home countries. Many of these immigrants, including David Koranyi from Hungary and Amir Makled from Michigan, express concerns about government overreach and the atmosphere of fear reminiscent of autocratic rule. They highlight issues such as aggressive questioning at borders and targeting of dissenters, which they associate with the oppressive environments they escaped. 

Scholars like Steven Levitsky warn that the U.S. is moving toward authoritarianism, citing the weaponization of government against political rivals and media. While some immigrants, like Lily Tang Williams, argue that it is the current administration that resembles authoritarianism, others, including Fulya Pinar, fear for academic freedom under Trump's policies. The article also draws parallels to tactics used by leaders like Turkey's Erdogan and the Philippines' Duterte, emphasizing the long-lasting impact of such authoritarian practices on media and civil liberties. Journalist Maria Ressa underscores the importance of not succumbing to fear, encouraging Americans to actively defend their rights. Overall, the piece illustrates a growing concern among immigrants about the erosion of democratic norms in the U.S.
