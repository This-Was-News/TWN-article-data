## Article summary
Senate Republicans faced a significant setback as the Senate parliamentarian ruled that a key Medicaid change in their proposed budget bill did not comply with Senate rules, jeopardizing their timeline for a vote. The provision aimed to alter how states could tax Medicaid providers, which was crucial for offsetting tax cuts in the bill. Democrats celebrated this ruling, claiming it removed over $250 billion in healthcare cuts that would negatively impact many Americans. Despite this, Republican leaders indicated they would revise the provisions to align with the parliamentarian's guidance. The Medicaid discussions have been complex, especially concerning funding for rural hospitals, with some senators arguing the proposed $15 billion stabilization fund was insufficient. Senate Majority Leader John Thune faces pressure to pass the bill by July 4, as it encapsulates President Trump's domestic agenda. However, internal disagreements among Republicans and concerns over deficit spending may hinder progress. The parliamentarian is also reviewing other tax provisions, which could further complicate the bill's passage. Ultimately, Thune can only afford to lose three GOP votes, adding to the urgency of resolving these issues.
