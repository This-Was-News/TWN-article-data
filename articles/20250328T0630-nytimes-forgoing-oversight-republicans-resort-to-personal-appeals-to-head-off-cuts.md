## Article summary
The article discusses how Republican lawmakers are responding to cuts proposed by President Trump and Elon Musk's administration, particularly those affecting federal programs in their districts. Instead of formally challenging these cuts, many Republicans are leveraging personal connections to influence decisions and protect local services. For instance, Representative Tom Cole successfully intervened to save facilities in his district by directly contacting relevant agency staff. This strategy highlights a significant shift in congressional operations, where Republicans have largely ceded oversight power to the executive branch and now rely on relationships for influence.

Democrats, in contrast, express frustration over their lack of access to the administration, often facing silence in response to their inquiries. They argue that this reliance on personal connections undermines Congress's authority and will negatively impact constituents without similar access. Some bipartisan efforts have emerged, with Democrats teaming up with Republicans to advocate for specific issues, but the overall dynamic appears skewed in favor of those with ties to the administration. The article illustrates a partisan divide where access and influence dictate the effectiveness of congressional representation amid sweeping government cuts.
