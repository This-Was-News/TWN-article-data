## Article summary
President Trump has dismissed Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. from his position as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, thanking him for his over 40 years of service. Trump announced that he will nominate Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, a retired three-star general, to take over the role. Brown, noted for being the first Black man to lead a military branch, had previously faced criticism regarding perceived "woke" policies that some argued undermined military readiness. His ouster was anticipated following the confirmation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who had openly called for Brown's removal. Hegseth praised Brown for his service but indicated a need to replace several top military officials, including Adm. Lisa Franchetti and Gen. James Slife. The firings have raised concerns among lawmakers, with Sen. Jack Reed suggesting they reflect a politically charged purge that could harm military professionalism. This move is part of a broader shake-up at the Pentagon, which includes plans to cut approximately 5,400 probationary workers and reduce the civilian workforce by 5-8%. The Pentagon is also looking to implement significant budget cuts, amounting to $50 billion annually over the next five years.
