## Article summary
Federal judges issued temporary restraining orders against President Trump's executive orders targeting law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which had participated in investigations of him. The rulings prevent punishments outlined in the orders, such as banning lawyers from government access. Judge John Bates criticized Trump's actions for penalizing Jenner & Block for its pro bono work. Following this, another judge issued a similar order against WilmerHale. Trump’s campaign against these firms reflects his anger towards lawyers involved in his legal challenges, leading to a divide in the legal industry on how to respond. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono work to avoid similar repercussions, prompting criticism from peers who view such deals as capitulation. The White House indicated that more firms may face similar scrutiny, particularly those employing lawyers linked to investigations of Trump. This situation has sparked intense debate within the legal community about whether to negotiate or resist Trump's actions. Ultimately, Trump's administration aims to compel law firms to represent conservative causes, asserting that they have been historically overlooked.
