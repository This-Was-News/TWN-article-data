## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy firmly rejected the idea of formally ceding Ukrainian territory, emphasizing that any peace deal excluding Ukraine would be ineffective. He dismissed the planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning that such a deal would lead to 'dead solutions.' Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that lasting peace must include Ukraine's voice. He asserted that Ukrainians will not give land to the occupier. Meanwhile, Trump confirmed his meeting with Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, suggesting that any agreement might involve territorial swaps. The summit, scheduled for Alaska, is seen as a potential breakthrough, though analysts note that Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their terms for peace. The meeting breaks with expectations, as it will be held on U.S. soil, validating Putin after years of isolation. Trump's ultimatum for additional sanctions on Russia if no progress is made toward a settlement has not yet been addressed. Despite Trump's efforts, the Kremlin's army continues to advance in Ukraine, with both sides far apart on peace terms.
