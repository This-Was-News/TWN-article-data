## Article summary
Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen visited El Salvador to advocate for the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported by the Trump administration. During his visit, Van Hollen finally met with Abrego Garcia after being denied access twice, highlighting the challenges he faced in securing the meeting. Abrego Garcia's wife expressed relief upon learning that her husband is alive, despite ongoing concerns about his situation. The senator's trip comes amidst a backdrop of political tension, as the White House reiterated its stance against Abrego Garcia's return, labeling him a potential security risk. 

Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland for about 15 years, was deported despite having been granted protections due to safety concerns. The Supreme Court has ordered his return, a directive that the Trump administration has yet to comply with. Van Hollen continues to press for Abrego Garcia's due process and has called attention to the lack of evidence from the Salvadoran government regarding his alleged gang affiliation. Meanwhile, other lawmakers are considering similar visits to El Salvador to advocate for Abrego Garcia and address broader immigration issues. The situation remains contentious, with differing views on immigration policy among lawmakers.
