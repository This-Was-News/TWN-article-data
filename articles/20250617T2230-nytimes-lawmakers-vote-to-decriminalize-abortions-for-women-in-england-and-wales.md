## Article summary
British lawmakers have voted to largely decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, marking a significant shift in response to ongoing debates about reproductive rights. The amendment, passed by a vote of 370 to 137, aims to prevent women from being prosecuted for terminating pregnancies after 24 weeks, although medical professionals could still face charges. Currently, abortion is legally permitted under specific conditions set by the 1967 Abortion Act, but the 1861 Offenses Against the Person Act still criminalizes it theoretically.

Supporters of the change argue the existing law is outdated and should be treated as a health care issue rather than a criminal one, especially considering cases where women have been charged for actions related to their pregnancies. The amendment, proposed by Labour Party lawmaker Tonia Antoniazzi, will not repeal the criminal law but will protect women from investigation and prosecution. 

Opposition comes from groups like the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which views the changes as a threat to unborn lives. Advocates for the amendment, including medical organizations, argue that it aligns the UK with more progressive abortion laws in other countries. The vote reflects a growing recognition of women's rights and health care needs amidst a backdrop of intensified anti-abortion sentiments in the United States.
