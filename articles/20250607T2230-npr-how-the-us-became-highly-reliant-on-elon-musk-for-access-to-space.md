## Article summary
The U.S. has become highly reliant on SpaceX for space operations, particularly for its crewed missions to the International Space Station and its Starship program. This dependence is threatened by a feud between SpaceX founder Elon Musk and former President Trump, who has threatened to cut federal contracts with SpaceX. The relationship between the U.S. government and SpaceX has grown since the Obama administration, when partnerships were encouraged despite initial doubts about SpaceX's capabilities. SpaceX’s innovative rocket technology has significantly increased its competitiveness, leading to a dominant position in both U.S. and global launch markets. The Defense Department now heavily relies on SpaceX's Starlink service for military communications, with concerns arising from Musk's control over this critical technology. 

Challenges with SpaceX's Starship program could impact NASA's Artemis lunar mission timeline, as the rocket has faced multiple failures. Meanwhile, alternatives like Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are in development but face their own delays. Despite the tensions, experts believe that neither Musk nor Trump could easily act on their threats to terminate contracts, as such actions would likely face legal challenges. Overall, while SpaceX plays a crucial role in U.S. space operations, its future involvement may hinge on resolving these political dynamics and technological hurdles.
