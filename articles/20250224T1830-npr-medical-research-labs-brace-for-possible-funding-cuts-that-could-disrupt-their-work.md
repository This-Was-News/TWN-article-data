## Article summary
The Trump administration's proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding are causing significant concern among medical researchers. A new policy to cap indirect costs at 15% would drastically impact labs like Dr. Donald Milton's at the University of Maryland, which studies respiratory viruses. Currently, his lab receives about 56% for indirect costs, and losing this funding could lead to staff reductions and hinder ongoing research. The NIH, the largest public funder of biomedical research, allocates a considerable portion of its $48 billion budget to indirect costs, which cover essential operational expenses. The administration argues that institutions should streamline costs, allowing NIH to redirect funds to more scientific research. However, legal challenges have arisen, with a federal judge temporarily blocking the cap on funding. If implemented, Milton predicts he could lose $1.1 million of his $3.3 million NIH funding, potentially forcing layoffs of half his team. Amid these uncertainties, research continues, focusing on critical questions about airborne transmission and pandemic preparedness. The situation highlights the precarious nature of medical research funding and the potential consequences of administrative changes.
