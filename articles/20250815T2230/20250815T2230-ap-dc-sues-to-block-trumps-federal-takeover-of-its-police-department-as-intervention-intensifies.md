## Article summary
Washington, D.C. officials sued to block President Donald Trump's takeover of the city's police department, following his administration's appointment of a federal official as the new emergency head. The D.C. police chief argued that Trump's move would disrupt law and order. The legal battle reflects escalating tensions between the Democratic-majority city and the Republican administration. A federal judge indicated that the law likely doesn't grant the Trump administration full control over the city's police but acknowledged the president has some authority. The judge urged both sides to reach a compromise. The Trump administration defended its actions, citing broad authority to determine the kind of help Washington police must provide. Meanwhile, residents and activists have observed a significant show of federal force across the city, including National Guard troops and federal law enforcement teams making arrests. Protesters rallied against the takeover, advocating for D.C.'s home rule.
