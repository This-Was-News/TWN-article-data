## Article summary
Children experiencing mental health crises and requiring hospitalization often face prolonged stays in emergency departments, according to a new study. The research, published in JAMA Health Forum, analyzed records of over 250,000 emergency department visits by children on Medicaid and found that about 10% of these visits resulted in stays of three days or longer. The most common reasons for these extended stays were depressive disorders and suicidal thoughts or attempts. In some states, such as North Carolina, Florida, and Maine, up to 25% of mental health visits led to children boarding in the emergency department for 3-7 days. Experts note that this issue has been growing for decades, with a particularly dramatic rise in recent years due to an increase in children's behavioral health crises and a lack of adequate mental health services. Many states have a critically low number of psychiatric beds for children, exacerbating the problem. Without sufficient outpatient and inpatient mental health care options, families often turn to emergency departments for help, only to find limited available care. Children stuck in ERs for days may experience worsening symptoms and lack access to therapeutic activities, creating a challenging and heartbreaking situation for families.
