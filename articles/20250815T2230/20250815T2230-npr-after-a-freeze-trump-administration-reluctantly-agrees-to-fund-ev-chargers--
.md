## Article summary
The Trump administration has restarted a federal program to fund high-speed EV chargers along U.S. highways after a six-month freeze and legal battle with states. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, created in 2021, faced opposition from President Trump but remains law. The Department of Transportation has released new guidance to unfreeze funds, removing several Biden-era requirements. While officials disagree with the program's merits, they acknowledge Congress's authority over spending. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, leading a states' lawsuit, finds the restart encouraging but notes the legal challenge continues. EV advocates and charging companies celebrate the end of the freeze but criticize the delay. The NEVI program, initially slow, had accelerated funding before the freeze. The new guidance removes requirements related to rural engagement, disadvantaged communities, and safety standards, giving states more discretion. Some changes are praised, but critics argue the delay was unnecessary. The freeze disrupted projects and delayed progress, with industry experts noting the need for more funding to keep up with demand.
