## Article summary
President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have arrived in Alaska for a high-stakes summit aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. The two leaders met at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, where they shook hands and held talks. Trump expressed confidence in his relationship with Putin, hoping to leverage it for productive discussions. He emphasized the need for a rapid ceasefire, stating he is willing to discuss business and trade with Putin but insists on resolving the war first. Trump warned of severe consequences if progress is not made. European leaders have urged Putin to agree to a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine before any peace talks begin. Analysts have low expectations for a major breakthrough, viewing the summit as a win for Putin. However, Samuel Charap from the Rand Corporation suggests that Putin may want to ensure Trump sees the meeting as a success to avoid increased U.S. pressure. Trump has mentioned the possibility of a land swap between Russia and Ukraine, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy strongly opposes ceding territory. As the summit took place, Zelenskyy criticized ongoing Russian attacks on Ukraine, emphasizing the importance of American strength in the negotiations.
