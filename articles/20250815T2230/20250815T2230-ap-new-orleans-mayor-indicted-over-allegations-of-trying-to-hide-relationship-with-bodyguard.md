## Article summary
New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted on charges of conspiracy, fraud, and obstruction for allegedly hiding a romantic relationship with her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappe. The indictment claims they used encrypted messages and deleted conversations to conceal their personal relationship while Vappe was on duty and taxpayer-funded travel. Cantrell faces these charges just months before leaving office due to term limits, making her the first mayor of New Orleans to be charged while in office. Prosecutors allege that Cantrell and Vappe engaged in activities such as harassing a citizen, deleting evidence, and making false statements to FBI agents. The mayor's office has not responded to requests for comment. Cantrell and her allies have claimed she is being unfairly targeted, but prosecutors deny any bias. The indictment follows a history of public corruption in New Orleans, including the conviction of former Mayor Ray Nagin. Cantrell's tenure has been marked by clashes with city council members and a recall effort in 2022. As she approaches the end of her term, her political influence has waned, overshadowed by controversies and feuds.
