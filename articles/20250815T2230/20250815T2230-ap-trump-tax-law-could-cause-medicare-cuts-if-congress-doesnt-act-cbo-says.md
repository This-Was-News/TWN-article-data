## Article summary
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports that President Donald Trump's tax and spending law could lead to automatic cuts of up to $491 billion to Medicare from 2027 to 2034 if Congress does not intervene. These cuts are triggered by a 2010 law that mandates across-the-board reductions when legislation increases the federal deficit. The CBO estimates the law will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, potentially impacting Medicare programs despite Trump and Republicans' pledges not to cut Medicare. Democrats, who requested the CBO analysis, criticize the potential cuts, with Rep. Brendan F. Boyle highlighting the impact on American families and rural hospitals. Rural hospitals are already struggling with cuts to Medicaid, and further Medicare reductions could worsen their financial shortfalls. Republicans have defended the tax cuts, arguing they will stimulate economic growth and pointing to $50 billion in funding for rural hospitals included in the package.
