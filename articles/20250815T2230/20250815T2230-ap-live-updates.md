## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded a high-stakes summit in Alaska, lasting over two and a half hours, aimed at addressing the Russia-Ukraine war. The meeting, attended by top advisors, could significantly influence the war's trajectory and European security. Trump's team portrays him as a skilled negotiator capable of ending the conflict, while Putin seeks to solidify Russia's territorial gains and limit Ukraine's NATO aspirations. Key demands include Ukraine recognizing Russian-annexed regions and abandoning NATO membership. The exclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the talks has drawn criticism. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Washington, D.C., are in a legal dispute over Trump's takeover of the city's police department. Additionally, global plastic pollution treaty negotiations have stalled, and Trump's stance on legacy admissions in colleges has been questioned.
