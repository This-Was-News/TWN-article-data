## Article summary
A man fleeing immigration agents outside a Home Depot store in Southern California was struck and killed by an SUV after running onto a nearby freeway. The incident occurred in Monrovia, about 20 miles northeast of Los Angeles, where police received a call about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducting enforcement activities. The man fled on foot toward the freeway and was struck by a vehicle, later dying at a hospital. This incident follows a series of arrests at Home Depot stores and other locations as the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement. The man is the second person reported to have died in Southern California while trying to flee federal immigration authorities. On Friday, Border Patrol agents in unmarked SUVs conducted operations at a Home Depot location in Los Angeles, arresting a Guatemalan woman with a criminal background. The California Highway Patrol is investigating the crash and the circumstances surrounding the man's presence on the freeway. Immigrant advocates planned a vigil to denounce the widespread raids. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security stated that the man was not being pursued by any of its law enforcement agencies. The Trump administration has conducted arrests at various locations, including Home Depot stores and car washes, with many individuals held in immigration detention. Last month, a federal court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out indiscriminate sweeps, with a hearing scheduled for September. Home Depot spokesperson George Lane stated that the company is not involved in immigration operations and deferred questions to ICE.
