## Article summary
In a recent congressional hearing, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard asserted that they did not share classified information in a Signal chat group discussing a U.S. bombing campaign in Yemen. This testimony came amid scrutiny following an incident where journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to the group, which included high-ranking officials like Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Democratic senators challenged the intelligence leaders' claims, demanding transparency and evidence regarding the chat's content. Ratcliffe maintained that his messages were lawful and did not contain classified material, while Gabbard refrained from confirming her participation. The National Security Council acknowledged the authenticity of the chat but stated it was reviewing how Goldberg was added. Critics have raised concerns over the use of Signal, a publicly available app, for sensitive discussions, highlighting that such matters should occur in secure facilities. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed alarm over the breach, with calls for further investigation into the incident. The Pentagon had previously warned against using Signal due to vulnerabilities, and lawmakers are now demanding accountability for the security lapse.
