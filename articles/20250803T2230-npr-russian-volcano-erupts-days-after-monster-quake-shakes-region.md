## Article summary
The Krashennnkov Volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, days after a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck the region. The eruption triggered an aviation red alert, later downgraded to orange, due to an ash cloud reaching 27,000 feet. The volcano's eruption posed no immediate threat to the sparsely populated area, and reserve employees evacuated the surrounding region. The earthquake, one of the largest ever recorded, caused minimal damage but sparked tsunami warnings across the Pacific. Researchers are investigating the potential link between the earthquake and the volcanic activity, with experts suggesting that seismic waves might have influenced the eruption.
