## Article summary
Harvard was initially prepared to pay $500 million to settle its dispute with the Trump administration, but a $50 million deal with Brown University has complicated negotiations. Harvard officials are frustrated that Brown secured a much smaller settlement and believe their school is being unfairly targeted. The White House argues that Harvard's issues are more severe, including allegations of antisemitism and non-compliance with Supreme Court rulings on admissions. Harvard is considering directing any settlement funds toward workforce development programs to avoid perceived political concessions. The ongoing dispute highlights the tense relationship between Harvard and the Trump administration, with Harvard leaders wary of entering long-term agreements with a government they view as untrustworthy.
