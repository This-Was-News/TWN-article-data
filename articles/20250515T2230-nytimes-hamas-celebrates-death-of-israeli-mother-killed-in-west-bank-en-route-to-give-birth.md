## Article summary
An Israeli woman named Tzeela Gez, who was on her way to the hospital to give birth, was shot and killed in the West Bank, an act that Hamas hailed as heroic. Her baby boy survived after an emergency cesarean section, though he remains in serious but stable condition. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Israeli officials labeled it terrorism and are actively searching for the shooter. The incident occurred amid escalating violence in the West Bank, where Israeli forces have intensified operations against militant groups, resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties and displacements. 

Tzeela Gez, 30, a mother of three, was shot while traveling with her husband, who was also injured but was able to inform paramedics of her condition. Despite the doctors' efforts, Ms. Gez succumbed to her injuries shortly after the emergency surgery. Following her death, Hamas encouraged further attacks against Israel, while Israeli military forces began encircling nearby Palestinian villages. In response, far-right Israeli politicians called for harsh retribution against Palestinian communities. The ongoing conflict has led to violence on both sides, with extremist settlers also attacking Palestinians in the region.
