## Article summary
The Tea app, designed to help women share information about potential online matches, suffered a major data breach, exposing sensitive user data including driver's licenses, direct messages, and selfies. The breach, discovered on July 25, led to users' personal information being leaked on the 4chan message board, including government IDs used for verification. The company, which has over 6.2 million users, faces two class-action lawsuits in California following the breach. Experts highlight the risks of digital "whisper networks," which, while intended to protect women, can lead to unchecked accusations and online mob behavior. The breach also resulted in real-world consequences, with users facing threats and the potential for defamation lawsuits, underscoring the complex nature of online information sharing.
