## Article summary
A large study called POINTER, involving over 2,100 sedentary individuals aged 60 to 79, found that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can improve thinking and memory, and reduce age-related cognitive decline. Participants in an intensive program, which included aerobic exercise, a Mediterranean diet, cognitive training, and social activities, showed significant improvements in mental abilities, comparable to being one to two years younger. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that lifestyle changes can alter the trajectory of cognitive aging. The Alzheimer's Association plans to invest $40 million to implement these findings, focusing on community delivery methods and healthcare provider involvement. Experts recommend increasing cognitive challenges, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and engaging in social activities to promote brain health.
