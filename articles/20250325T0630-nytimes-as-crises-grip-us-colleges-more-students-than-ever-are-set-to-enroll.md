## Article summary
The New York Times article discusses the challenges facing students as they prepare for college amidst significant upheaval in higher education. With approximately 3.9 million high school seniors graduating, colleges are grappling with financial pressures, political conflicts over diversity, and changes following the Supreme Court's ban on affirmative action in admissions. The anticipated largest freshman class will encounter altered admissions processes and potential budget cuts that could impact course offerings and staffing.

The Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Education Department raise concerns about the future of federal financial aid programs, including Pell Grants and student loans. While community colleges remain less embroiled in political disputes, they face persistent enrollment challenges. The article highlights the diverse responses of universities to shifting campus cultures, particularly regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, with some institutions eliminating or renaming these initiatives in response to legislative pressures.

Additionally, the affirmative action ban has led to a decrease in Black student enrollment at selective schools, prompting universities to seek alternative methods to maintain diversity through financial aid and recruitment efforts. Overall, the article illustrates how these crises may profoundly affect students' experiences on college campuses this fall.
