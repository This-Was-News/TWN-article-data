## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed skepticism regarding a U.S.-proposed ceasefire with Ukraine, emphasizing that any truce must address the underlying causes of the conflict. During a news conference, he acknowledged the idea of halting fighting but raised concerns that a 30-day ceasefire could allow Ukraine to regroup and rearm, questioning how such a ceasefire would be enforced. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized Putin's response as predictable and manipulative, suggesting it was a tactic to delay peace efforts. Meanwhile, President Trump expressed hope that Putin would act appropriately but lamented the complexity of the negotiations, highlighting the urgency as casualties continue to rise. Putin's foreign policy adviser reiterated demands for Ukraine to recognize Russia's territorial claims and to withdraw troops, while also seeking limitations on Ukraine's military capabilities. As the situation evolves, Russian forces have regained much territory lost during previous Ukrainian offensives. The U.S. has restored military aid to Ukraine amid ongoing discussions of a ceasefire, with Trump warning of financial repercussions for Russia if it resists.
