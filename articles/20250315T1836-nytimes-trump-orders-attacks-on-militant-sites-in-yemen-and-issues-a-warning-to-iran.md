## Article summary
On March 15, 2025, President Trump announced significant U.S. military strikes against Houthi militant sites in Yemen, marking a new offensive aimed at disrupting Iranian influence and restoring international shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The air and naval strikes targeted Houthi radar, air defenses, and missile systems, with at least one senior commander among the targets. This military action was described as a response to ongoing Houthi attacks on shipping and a warning to Iran to cease its support for the militants. Trump emphasized the need for decisive action against the Houthis, stating that their attacks on American vessels would not be tolerated.

The strikes were conducted by U.S. forces, including fighter jets from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman, and were the most significant military operation of Trump's second term. U.S. officials indicated that the bombardment could continue for weeks and may escalate based on Houthi reactions. The Houthis, who have been involved in a long-standing conflict in Yemen, have demonstrated resilience despite previous U.S. and coalition strikes, and they have warned of potential counterattacks.

The strikes come in the context of heightened tensions following the Hamas-led assault on Israel and the subsequent blockade on Gaza, which has prompted the Houthis to threaten increased attacks on shipping. Trump's administration is also facing pressure from allies, particularly Israel, to take a more aggressive stance against Iran's nuclear ambitions. Overall, the situation remains volatile, with ongoing concerns about the potential for a broader regional conflict.
