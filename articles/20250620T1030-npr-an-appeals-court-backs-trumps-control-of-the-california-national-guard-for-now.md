## Article summary
A federal appeals court in California has temporarily upheld President Trump's control over the California National Guard, rejecting Governor Gavin Newsom's attempt to regain authority. This decision comes after Trump federalized the Guard to address unrest and protect federal property during protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tactics. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with a lower court ruling that deemed Trump's actions illegal, asserting that the president can deploy the Guard to ensure federal law enforcement operates without interference. The appeals court noted incidents of violence during the protests, which justified Trump's deployment. While it acknowledged the potential for escalating tensions, the court deemed California's claims as speculative. This ruling marks the first instance in 60 years where a president activated a state's National Guard over the governor's objections. Trump celebrated the ruling as a significant victory, while Newsom vowed to continue the legal fight, asserting the president is not above the law. Another court hearing is set to address the control of the Guard moving forward.
