## Article summary
The U.S. historically welcomed Chinese students, particularly after the normalization of relations in the 1970s, as part of soft power diplomacy. This openness, exemplified by Haipei Shue's experience in the late 1980s, is now starkly contrasted by the Trump administration's recent visa policies targeting Chinese students with ties to the Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The administration claims that such students pose national security risks, which has led to a significant decline in the number of Chinese students in the U.S. 

Shue, now president of United Chinese Americans, views these policies as a betrayal of America's image as a beacon of opportunity. The historical context reveals a long and complex relationship, with Chinese students making notable contributions to American society. However, current geopolitical tensions and the pandemic have exacerbated the decline in academic exchanges, with fewer American scholars studying in China. Experts argue that the broad nature of these policies fails to differentiate between genuine students and potential security threats, raising concerns about the future of U.S.-China educational ties. Shue reflects on the painful shift from viewing foreign students as assets to seeing them as liabilities, highlighting a troubling change in the U.S. stance toward international education.
