## Article summary
The article discusses growing allegations of racial profiling in immigration raids conducted by ICE agents in Los Angeles. Incidents include the detention of individuals like Emma de Paz, who was arrested without being asked for identification, highlighting concerns that agents are targeting people based solely on their appearance. Advocates and civil rights lawyers argue that these actions reflect a pattern of discrimination against Latino communities, with raids occurring frequently in areas known for Latino workers. The ACLU has filed a federal class action lawsuit claiming these immigration operations are unconstitutional, asserting that agents often detain individuals without reasonable suspicion, violating Fourth Amendment rights. Despite denials from the Department of Homeland Security, legal experts maintain that agents must have specific, articulable facts to justify arrests, not just assumptions based on race. The article recounts the experience of Javier Ramirez, a U.S. citizen who was detained during a raid, emphasizing the trauma experienced by those wrongfully targeted. Community protests have emerged in response to these raids, illustrating the growing fear and anger within the Latino community. The overall sentiment reflects a sense of vulnerability and injustice faced by individuals perceived as immigrants.
