## Article summary
European leaders expressed their unwavering support for Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky following a contentious meeting with former President Donald Trump, who harshly criticized Zelensky and expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting, which escalated into a heated argument, highlighted Trump's frustration with Zelensky's comments about Putin and resulted in Zelensky leaving without signing a critical minerals deal. European leaders, including those from France, Germany, and Poland, rallied behind Ukraine, emphasizing its bravery and dignity in the face of aggression. They are concerned about Trump's potential to rapidly change U.S. policy towards Ukraine, especially with upcoming discussions in London. Speaker Mike Johnson's shift in stance from supporting Ukraine to aligning with Trump’s views reflects a broader Republican trend towards skepticism about continued aid. Amidst this political turmoil, Zelensky's efforts to secure ongoing U.S. support have intensified, as he navigates a complex relationship with the new administration. The situation has left Ukrainians feeling blindsided and determined to continue their fight, regardless of U.S. support. The clash has also raised alarms in Europe about the changing dynamics of American foreign policy. Overall, the incident signals a significant shift in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship and poses challenges for ongoing support against Russian aggression.
