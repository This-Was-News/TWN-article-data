## Article summary
The Russia-Ukraine cease-fire talks are set to take place in Istanbul, marking the second round of negotiations since the resumption of direct dialogue two weeks ago. Both sides are expected to exchange their cease-fire conditions, but low expectations surround the talks. Pressure from President Trump has influenced the discussions, yet neither Russia nor Ukraine is likely to yield acceptable terms to the other. The first round of talks resulted in an agreement for a large prisoner swap, but no significant progress on cease-fire conditions was achieved.

Ukraine seeks an immediate cease-fire before negotiating a broader peace deal, while Russia demands territorial concessions and restrictions on Ukraine's military capabilities. The composition of the negotiating teams suggests a technical focus, with Ukraine's delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Russia's by Vladimir Medinsky. Meanwhile, intense military actions continue, with Russia launching a new offensive and Ukraine adapting its tactics, including drone strikes deep within Russian territory. The ongoing conflict, which has escalated since Russia's invasion in February 2022, has resulted in substantial casualties and economic challenges for both nations.
