## Article summary
Senate Republicans have successfully passed President Trump's comprehensive domestic policy bill, which includes significant tax cuts and reductions in Medicaid, SNAP, and clean energy funding, setting up a critical vote in the House. The final vote was 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, while three Republicans opposed the bill. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts from 2017 and is designed to offset costs through major cuts to social programs, potentially affecting coverage for around 11 million people. Despite the passage, the bill faces challenges in the House, where some GOP members have expressed dissent regarding its provisions.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has emphasized the urgency to pass the bill quickly, aiming for completion by July 4. The Senate's version includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, which has raised concerns among fiscal conservatives. Additionally, the bill proposes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and cuts to clean energy credits. Senate Democrats unanimously oppose the legislation, criticizing its potential negative impacts on vulnerable populations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has condemned the bill, asserting it will have lasting detrimental effects on Americans.
