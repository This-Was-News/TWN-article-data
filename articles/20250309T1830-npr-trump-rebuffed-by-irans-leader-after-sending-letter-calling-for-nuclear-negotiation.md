## Article summary
President Trump recently sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proposing negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. In response, Khamenei dismissed the overture, criticizing what he termed "bullying governments" for attempting to impose their expectations on Iran. Trump emphasized the need for a deal rather than military action, expressing a preference for diplomacy over conflict. While Khamenei rebuffed Trump's request, Iran's UN mission indicated a willingness to discuss the "militarization" of its nuclear activities, but firmly rejected any talks about dismantling its nuclear program. 

Iran maintains that its nuclear pursuits are for peaceful purposes, yet tensions have escalated, particularly following threats to develop nuclear weapons amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. Senator Lindsey Graham articulated a vision for a potential deal that would halt Iran's uranium enrichment and eliminate its capability to produce nuclear weapons. Trump reiterated the importance of negotiations, suggesting that failing to engage could lead to more serious consequences. Overall, the situation remains tense, with diplomatic efforts facing significant challenges.
