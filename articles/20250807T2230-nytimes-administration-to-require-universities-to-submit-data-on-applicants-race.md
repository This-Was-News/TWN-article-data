## Article summary
The Trump administration has directed the Education Department to collect detailed data on college applicants' race, gender, test scores, and grade point averages. This move aims to scrutinize universities for potential preferences given to minorities in admissions, aligning with the administration's agenda to shift the ideological balance in higher education. Legal experts suggest this could challenge universities, despite their allowed consideration of race in holistic admissions reviews. Critics argue the administration's actions target reducing enrollment of Black and Hispanic students. The administration's recent agreements with Brown and Columbia Universities already grant access to applicants' standardized test scores, grades, and racial information. Education Secretary Linda McMahon emphasizes the new requirements will ensure meritocracy in higher education. Universities must report data on applicants and admitted students, including race, sex, test scores, and academic achievements. Some experts argue the administration's focus is misplaced, suggesting a need for transparency on college costs and socioeconomic status. Supporters of the move believe it will help verify compliance with the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling. Without socioeconomic data, the collected information may inaccurately suggest racial bias in admissions based on test scores alone.
