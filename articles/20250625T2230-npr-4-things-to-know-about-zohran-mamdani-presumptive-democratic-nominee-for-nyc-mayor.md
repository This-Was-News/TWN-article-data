## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani is emerging as the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor after leading in the city's ranked-choice primary. The 33-year-old state assemblymember, who identifies as a democratic socialist, gained traction through engaging with voters and presenting progressive policy proposals that appeal particularly to younger constituents. His unexpected victory was characterized by a commanding 44% of the vote, significantly ahead of former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who conceded but may run as an independent in the general election. If elected, Mamdani would make history as the city's first Muslim mayor and its youngest in over a century.

Mamdani, who was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2020, prioritizes issues like affordable housing and public transportation. He has received endorsements from prominent progressives, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, bolstering his grassroots support. However, his views on Israel, particularly his criticism of its military actions and support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, have sparked controversy and divided opinions within the Democratic Party. Mamdani has faced personal attacks and threats during his campaign, highlighting the challenges he encounters as he navigates his political aspirations.
