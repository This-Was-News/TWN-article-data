## Article summary
The Federal Reserve is not expected to intervene quickly to support the markets amidst a downturn triggered by President Trump's tariffs, as stated by Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell. He emphasized the need to fully understand the economic effects of the tariffs before deciding on monetary policy. Currently, the market is experiencing a correction, nearing a bear market, with the S&P 500 just 2.6 percentage points away from a 20% decline from its peak. Powell indicated that substantial job losses would be necessary to justify any rate cuts, especially given the ongoing battle with inflation. The tariffs are likely to slow economic growth and increase prices, complicating the Fed's dual mandate of promoting employment and controlling inflation. President Trump has pressured the Fed to lower interest rates, but Powell remains resolute in maintaining the Fed's independence. Analysts predict a growing risk of recession, with Goldman Sachs estimating a 35% chance of one occurring in the next year. Despite market difficulties, long-term investment strategies remain vital, as historically, markets have rebounded after downturns. Investors are advised to exercise patience during this turbulent period, as enduring market fluctuations can lead to significant long-term gains.
