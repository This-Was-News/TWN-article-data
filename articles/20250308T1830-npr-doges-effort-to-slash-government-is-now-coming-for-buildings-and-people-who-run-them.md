## Article summary
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is undertaking significant cuts to the federal government's real estate and workforce, aiming to reduce its physical footprint by shedding up to a quarter of its 360 million square feet of property. This initiative includes terminating hundreds of federal building leases, which has already resulted in over $100 million in savings. However, the cuts could disrupt essential public services, with offices like the IRS and Social Security potentially facing closures. The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages federal real estate, has abruptly fired more than 1,000 employees and is targeting a 63% reduction in its Public Building Service division. Critics within the GSA express concerns that the firings and lease terminations are being executed without proper analysis, leading to confusion and potential service disruptions. The GSA has faced backlash for its lack of transparency regarding the criteria for property cuts and employee layoffs. Moreover, the proposed sales of federal buildings, including courthouses and crucial service offices, have raised alarm among federal workers and the public. The ongoing changes have been described as hasty and lacking a clear strategy, with many employees fearing for their jobs and the quality of services provided to the public. As the situation develops, it remains unclear how these cuts will affect the operations and accessibility of vital government services.
