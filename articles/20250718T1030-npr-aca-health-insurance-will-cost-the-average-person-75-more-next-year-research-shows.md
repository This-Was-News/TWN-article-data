## Article summary
The average person buying Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance through Healthcare.gov or state-based marketplaces will face a 75% premium increase next year, according to a KFF analysis. Insurance companies are raising rates due to the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, which were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and significantly reduced costs. The loss of these subsidies could lead to 4.2 million more uninsured people, as healthier individuals may opt out, leaving a sicker insurance pool. Congress could extend the subsidies, but Republican opposition makes this unlikely. The premium hikes could reverse recent enrollment gains, particularly in Republican-leaning states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia, potentially leaving 8.2 million people uninsured.
