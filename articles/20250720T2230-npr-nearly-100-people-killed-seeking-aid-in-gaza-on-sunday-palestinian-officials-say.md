## Article summary
On Sunday, at least 94 Palestinians were killed by Israeli military fire across Gaza while seeking food aid, marking one of the deadliest days in recent months. The deadliest incident occurred in northern Gaza, near the Israeli border area of Zikim, where 81 Palestinians were killed while trying to obtain flour from U.N. World Food Programme trucks. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that Israeli forces targeted civilians waiting for humanitarian aid, with a Gaza City field hospital receiving 95 injured individuals. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to remove an immediate threat and are examining the incident, though they dispute the reported casualty numbers. The WFP condemned the violence, emphasizing the need for the protection of civilians and aid workers, as food shortages and hunger persist in Gaza. Additionally, Israel announced new evacuations in central Gaza, urging residents to leave certain areas due to ongoing military operations. Pope Leo XIV also spoke out, mourning the deaths of three people sheltering at the Holy Family church in Gaza City and calling for an end to the violence.
