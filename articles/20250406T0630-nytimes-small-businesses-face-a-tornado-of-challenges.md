## Article summary
Small businesses are currently facing a multitude of challenges, including funding freezes, staffing cuts, and significant tariffs introduced by the Trump administration, which have created economic uncertainty. Entrepreneurs like Ben Coryell, who runs a wilderness guiding company, report increasing cancellations and concerns about future operations due to these changes. The National Park Service's personnel cuts have further complicated permit processing for small businesses dependent on federal routes. Many small firms have seen a decline in hiring and are struggling with rising inflation and interest rates, leading to increased credit card debt and financial distress. While there was initial optimism following Trump's election due to anticipated tax and regulatory reforms, that optimism has waned as new hurdles emerge. The Small Business Administration is planning substantial workforce cuts, which could impact its loan programs and disaster relief efforts. Additionally, the elimination of supportive agencies like the Minority Business Development Agency raises concerns among small business owners about losing essential resources and networking opportunities. Tariffs are particularly burdensome, forcing businesses to manage rising costs without the flexibility to easily switch suppliers. Overall, small business owners are navigating a turbulent landscape, unsure of how to sustain growth amidst ongoing challenges.
