## Article summary
In the first 100 days of President Trump's administration, the U.S. economy is showing signs of distress, contradicting his promise of a "golden age." Economic growth has slowed, the stock market has dropped significantly, and consumer confidence has reached its lowest point since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The upcoming GDP figures are expected to reveal a decline in growth, partially due to a surge in imports as businesses stocked up ahead of new tariffs. Consumers are increasingly worried that these tariffs will lead to higher prices and a potential recession. Although the job market remains stable with an unemployment rate of 4.2%, expectations about job security have worsened, reflecting concerns about the economy's future.

Trump's tariffs, which include a 10% tax on most imports and 145% on certain goods from China, have left many businesses uncertain. While some, like a Michigan mold maker, see potential benefits in bringing business back to the U.S., others, such as a Boston lighting store owner, report significant losses in sales. The overall sentiment among consumers and businesses is one of anxiety, as they navigate the implications of these trade policies.
