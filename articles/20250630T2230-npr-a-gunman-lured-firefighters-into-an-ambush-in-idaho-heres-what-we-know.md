## Article summary
In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, two firefighters were killed and a third wounded in an ambush after responding to a deliberately set brush fire. The incident occurred on Canfield Mountain, where the armed suspect had concealed himself and opened fire on the firefighters shortly after they arrived. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris confirmed that the attack was intentional and described it as a "total ambush," leaving the firefighters without a chance to defend themselves. The suspect was later found dead, and authorities located his body using a stationary cellphone signal. The firefight lasted several hours, leading to a shelter-in-place order for local residents. The motive for the attack remains unclear, and investigations have been complicated by the ongoing fire. Idaho Governor Brad Little condemned the act as a "heinous direct assault" on firefighters. The wounded firefighter is currently in critical condition following surgery. The community is in shock over the violence, with residents expressing disbelief at the tragic events.
