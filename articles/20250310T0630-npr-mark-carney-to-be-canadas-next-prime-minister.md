## Article summary
Mark Carney has been elected as Canada's new prime minister, succeeding Justin Trudeau, who stepped down amid low approval ratings. Carney, a centrist politician and former central banker, won the Liberal Party leadership race decisively, garnering nearly 86% of the votes. His leadership comes at a crucial time as he faces significant economic challenges, particularly in managing Canada's trade relationship with the United States amidst ongoing tariff threats from President Trump. 

In his acceptance speech, Carney addressed these tariff issues directly, emphasizing the need for Canada to stand firm against unjustified trade attacks. His victory has been attributed in part to rising nationalism in Canada, fueled by Trump's controversial remarks and policies. Carney's past experience as Governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England positions him well to navigate the current economic landscape. 

Despite being the second prime minister in Canadian history without a parliamentary seat, Carney is expected to call for federal elections soon after his swearing-in. As the Liberal Party's popularity rises, many Canadians view him as a steady leader capable of addressing international challenges. In contrast, his opponent, Pierre Poilievre, faces scrutiny for aligning with Trump-like rhetoric, which may not resonate well with the Canadian electorate.
