## Article summary
Robert Reich, a prominent figure in the fight against inequality, discusses his views on the political and personal moments he finds himself in, including his recent retirement from teaching and the publication of his memoir, "Coming Up Short." In the memoir, Reich argues that the baby boomer generation failed to strengthen democracy and reduce economic inequality, leading to a culture of brutality and bullying. He attributes the rise of Donald Trump to a 50-year history of neglect and a failure to appreciate the importance of democracy and holding back big money. Reich also discusses the role of bullying in his life and how it has shaped his views on inequality and power. He criticizes Democrats for not effectively addressing the concerns of working-class Americans and praises progressive Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zohran Mamdani for their focus on income inequality. Reich also shares his experiences teaching at universities and the importance of exposing students to diverse viewpoints. He discusses the challenges of reaching working-class Americans and the role of media in exploiting their anger. Reich reflects on his friendship with former Senator Alan Simpson and the importance of understanding the humanity of people with differing political views. He also addresses the perception of wealth and the American dream, arguing that the system is rigged against working-class Americans.
