## Article summary
Mental health workers at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles have initiated a hunger strike to demand better pay and benefits, following nearly six months of striking for parity with other employees. Eight therapists participated in a five-day hunger strike, expressing frustration over inadequate compensation compared to other healthcare roles within the organization. They argue that they deserve equal pensions and pay, as their salaries are significantly lower than those of occupational therapists and radiation techs. Many strikers have been financially strained, relying on food banks and loans from friends and family.

The workers have also highlighted issues such as insufficient time between patient appointments, impacting their ability to manage their workloads effectively. Kaiser Permanente acknowledges some discrepancies in pay but maintains that their compensation is competitive. The hunger strike has prompted management to reconsider negotiations, with Kaiser representatives expressing a desire to return to the bargaining table. The strike has gained attention for its potential to highlight broader issues of mental health parity in the healthcare system. Support from other unions and public figures has bolstered the strikers' cause, emphasizing the importance of solidarity in labor movements.
