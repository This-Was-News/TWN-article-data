## Article summary
Representative Mike Flood, a Republican from Nebraska, faced a hostile crowd at a town hall meeting in Lincoln, where he was booed and heckled for over an hour. The crowd, consisting of over 700 people, expressed anger and frustration over Flood's support for President Trump's domestic policy bill, which includes significant cuts to Medicaid, food benefits, and other programs. Flood attempted to defend the bill, claiming it would bring an influx of money into Nebraska hospitals and that it provided a middle-class tax cut, but the crowd remained unconvinced and chanted slogans such as "Tax the rich." The event highlighted the challenges faced by Republican lawmakers who are trying to sell unpopular legislation to their constituents, with many opting to avoid town halls altogether. Flood admitted that he had not read the entire bill before voting for it and acknowledged that the reception he received was not unexpected, but he maintained that showing up and engaging with constituents is part of his job.
