## Article summary
At least 24 people have died due to catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country, with many more, including 20 girls from a Christian summer camp, reported missing. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared a disaster for several counties and is deploying resources, including the Texas National Guard, for ongoing search and rescue efforts. Over 500 responders and 14 helicopters are actively working to locate those trapped, as the Guadalupe River rose dramatically, with some areas receiving up to 12 inches of rain in just an hour. The situation remains critical, and authorities expect the death toll may rise as rescue operations continue. 

Families are anxiously awaiting news at a reunification center, where some have been reunited with their loved ones, while others remain unaccounted for. The National Weather Service has issued warnings for continued flooding, predicting an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain, and localized areas could see up to 5 inches. The Guadalupe River is currently cresting at 39 feet, significantly above its normal level. Local officials have noted the extensive damage to infrastructure and properties, with assessments pending until floodwaters recede.
