## Article summary
In a recent meeting at the White House, President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron displayed a friendly rapport while highlighting their differing views on the Ukraine conflict. Trump refrained from labeling Russian President Vladimir Putin as a dictator, contrasting Macron's clear stance that Russia is the aggressor. The meeting coincided with the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, during which both leaders acknowledged the growing divide between the U.S. and Europe regarding the war. Trump claimed significant U.S. financial contributions to Ukraine, while Macron corrected him, emphasizing that European aid included substantial grants, not just loans.

Trump expressed optimism about potential peace talks with Putin, suggesting he might visit Russia if an agreement is reached. However, Macron stressed that any peace must uphold Ukrainian sovereignty and not result in a ceasefire without guarantees. The two leaders' discussions reflected broader tensions as Trump's administration diverges from traditional alliances, complicating relations with European nations. Macron's visit aimed to navigate these challenges and bolster cooperation as the U.S. shifts its approach to the conflict.
