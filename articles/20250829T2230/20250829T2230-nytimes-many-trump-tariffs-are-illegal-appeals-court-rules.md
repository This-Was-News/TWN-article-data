## Article summary
A federal appeals court ruled that many of President Trump's tariffs were issued illegally, upholding an earlier decision that the president lacks unlimited power to impose taxes on nearly all U.S. imports. The ruling, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, affects tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, but does not impact tariffs imposed for national security reasons. The court delayed implementation until October, allowing Trump to keep the contested duties in place temporarily. Trump criticized the ruling, asserting his authority to tax imported goods and expecting the Supreme Court to side with him. The administration plans to seek Supreme Court review. Meanwhile, Trump terminated former Vice President Kamala Harris's Secret Service protection, effective Monday, despite an extension by President Biden due to security concerns. Harris is set to embark on a nationwide book tour. Additionally, Trump proposed canceling $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, a move criticized as illegal by Senator Susan Collins. The administration also faced legal challenges over the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, with a hearing held to determine if she can remain in her position while contesting her dismissal. The court's decision could impact the Fed's independence and Trump's ability to influence interest rates. In other news, Washington Governor Bob Ferguson criticized Border Patrol arrests of wildfire fighters, and Senator Jon Ernst announced she will not seek re-election, potentially giving Democrats an opportunity to flip a Senate seat.
