## Article summary
The U.S. has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials ahead of the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting. The State Department, led by Secretary Marco Rubio, imposed new visa restrictions, though Palestinian representatives assigned to the UN mission were granted exceptions. This move is part of a series of actions by the Trump administration targeting Palestinians with visa restrictions, coinciding with the Israeli military declaring Gaza's largest city a combat zone. The State Department also suspended a program allowing injured Palestinian children from Gaza to receive medical treatment in the U.S. The decision was justified as being in the national security interests of the U.S., citing the PLO and PA's failure to comply with commitments and undermine peace prospects. The Palestinian Authority condemned the visa withdrawals as a violation of U.S. commitments and international law. The UN spokesman expressed hope for a resolution, emphasizing the importance of all member states being represented. The State Department clarified that representatives assigned to the Palestinian Authority mission at the UN would be granted waivers to continue their operations. The Trump administration has been pursuing a crackdown on individuals with legal permission to enter the U.S., sometimes relaxing standards for releasing information on canceled visas to make a public point. Palestinian Ambassador Ryad Mansour revealed that Abbas had planned to lead the delegation to the UN meetings and address the General Assembly, as well as attend a high-level meeting on a two-state solution.
