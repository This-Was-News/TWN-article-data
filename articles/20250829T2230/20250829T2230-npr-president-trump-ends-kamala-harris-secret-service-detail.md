## Article summary
President Trump has revoked former Vice President Kamala Harris' Secret Service protection, according to her spokesperson Kristen Allen. Typically, former vice presidents receive Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office, which would have meant Harris would have lost her protection after July. However, she had received an extension, which Trump is now revoking. This decision comes as Harris is about to embark on a nationwide tour to promote her new book, *107 Days*, which recounts her historically short run for president last year. Harris expressed gratitude to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety. She currently lives in Los Angeles, where she has been since leaving Washington in January. Trump has also revoked Secret Service detail for the adult children of former President Joe Biden.
