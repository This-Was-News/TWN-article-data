## Article summary
Judges, defense lawyers, and grand jurors in Washington, D.C., are questioning the validity of cases arising from President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime. A grand jury refused to indict a man who threw a sandwich at a federal agent, and prosecutors dropped another case due to illegal searches. Judges have criticized the detention of defendants for minor offenses and weak evidence. Over 1,200 people have been arrested, with many facing charges related to assaulting law enforcement or illegal possession of guns and drugs. The courts are struggling to handle the influx of cases, with some individuals held in jail for days before appearing before a judge. Defense attorneys argue that arrests are based on assumptions rather than evidence. The White House claims crime rates have significantly decreased, but critics argue that the aggressive approach may be leading to flawed prosecutions. Judges have expressed concerns about the handling of cases and the need for proper evaluations of evidence. The situation highlights the challenges of balancing public safety with civil liberties.
