## Article summary
Following President Trump's request, Missouri Republicans are set to redraw the state's congressional lines to help maintain the GOP majority in the U.S. House. Governor Mike Kehoe announced a special legislative session to draw a new voting map starting next Wednesday. The current congressional representation includes six Republicans and two Democrats. New maps could redistrict voters in the Kansas City area to help Republicans win a seat, potentially edging out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. Kehoe stated that Missouri's conservative values should be represented at all levels of government. Trump expressed optimism about winning the midterms in Missouri. Most of Missouri's Republican congressional delegation supports the move, including Rep. Bob Onder, who believes the map should reflect the state's values. Opponents, like Cleaver, argue that the attempt to gerrymander will silence voices and deny representation. Typically, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census. Democrats and some Republicans have urged states to stick to this schedule, fearing it could lead to redistricting in every election cycle. Trump's call for Republican-led states to redraw maps has sparked a nationwide redistricting race, with several states already taking action.
