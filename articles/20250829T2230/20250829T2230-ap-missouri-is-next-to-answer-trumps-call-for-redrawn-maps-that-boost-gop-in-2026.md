## Article summary
Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe has called lawmakers into a special session to redraw U.S. House districts, aiming to boost Republican representation ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. This move follows similar actions by Texas and California, where governors have also proposed redistricting plans to benefit their respective parties. Kehoe's proposed map targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's district, extending it into Republican-leaning rural areas. The governor also plans to introduce a constitutional amendment to make it harder to pass citizen-initiated ballot measures. Democrats have condemned the move, calling it an attack on democracy and a partisan power grab. Missouri's current House delegation consists of six Republicans and two Democrats. Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the House, and President Donald Trump has urged Republican-led states to strengthen their congressional seats to prevent a repeat of the 2018 midterms, where Democrats gained control. Other states, including Florida, Indiana, and Utah, are also considering redistricting efforts.
