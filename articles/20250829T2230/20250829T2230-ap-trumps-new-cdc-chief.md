## Article summary
Jim O'Neill, a former investor and critic of health regulations, has been appointed as the interim director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) following the removal of Susan Monarez. O'Neill, who has no medical training but holds degrees in humanities, has a background in health care policy and previously worked at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under President George W. Bush. He is known for his libertarian views and has expressed skepticism about federal bureaucracy, including proposing to eliminate the FDA's mandate to ensure drug effectiveness before market release. O'Neill has been tasked with stabilizing the CDC amid internal strife and efforts by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reshape vaccine policies. Unlike Kennedy, O'Neill has not been a vocal critic of public health measures during the pandemic but has criticized FDA efforts to restrict unproven COVID-19 treatments. He has expressed support for the CDC's traditional role in vaccine recommendations while refusing to criticize Kennedy's views on vaccine safety. O'Neill faces high-stakes decisions ahead, including signing off on new vaccine recommendations from a reshaped CDC panel. His dual roles at HHS and the CDC are demanding, and his tenure as interim director is limited to 210 days under federal law.
