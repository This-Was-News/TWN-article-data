## Article summary
A federal appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump lacked the legal authority to impose sweeping tariffs but allowed them to remain in place temporarily. The court upheld a lower court's decision that Trump could not declare national emergencies to impose import taxes on nearly every country, complicating Trump's ambitions to unilaterally overhaul U.S. trade policy. Meanwhile, Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe called a special session to redraw state districts, following Texas' lead in a growing national battle between Republicans and Democrats ahead of next year's congressional elections. The Trump administration also revoked visas for Palestinian officials, planned to deport Guatemalan children, and canceled funding for offshore wind projects. Additionally, a federal appeals court blocked the administration's plan to end protections for Venezuelan immigrants, and Trump canceled nearly $5 billion in foreign aid without congressional approval, setting up a potential government shutdown clash. The administration also ended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris and faced criticism over its handling of the CDC and the Federal Reserve's independence.
