## Article summary
Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol chief, is leading a controversial immigration crackdown in Southern California, which has drawn both outrage and praise, including from President Trump. Bovino has been instructed by federal officials to be on standby for potential deployment to other American cities. In just 11 weeks, he has transitioned from leading a less active sector on the Southern border to commanding a large-scale federal operation in Los Angeles. His aggressive tactics have included testing the limits of politicized law enforcement, clashing with California Democrats on social media, and producing promotional videos of his heavily armed officers. Bovino has also been involved in legal disputes, with accusations of racial profiling and illegal arrests. Supporters argue that he is removing undocumented immigrants with criminal records, while critics accuse him of showboating and using racial profiling. The operation in Los Angeles is one of the most aggressive displays of federal force in the country, comparable only to the federal takeover of the police force in the nation's capital. Bovino has received direct praise from President Trump for his efforts.
