## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's vision for U.S. relations with China and Russia, emphasizing his inclination towards deal-making with these nations. Trump has expressed a desire to normalize commerce with Russia and reduce tensions stemming from his trade war with China. Analysts suggest he may be aiming for a world where the U.S., China, and Russia each dominate their respective regions, reminiscent of 19th-century imperialism. His ambitions include extending U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere, illustrated by his controversial statements about Greenland and Canada. Critics argue that while Trump may have strong views on certain issues, he lacks a coherent foreign policy strategy. The article highlights Trump's discussions with Russia regarding Ukraine and his proposals that appear to favor Russian interests. Concerns are raised about his approach potentially undermining U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia, particularly regarding Taiwan. The piece concludes with uncertainty about how far Trump would go to defend Taiwan amid growing tensions with China.
