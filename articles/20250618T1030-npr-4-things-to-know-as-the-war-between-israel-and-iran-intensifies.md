## Article summary
The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified, marked by Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian military and nuclear facilities, which Israel claims are necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Civilians in Tehran are facing panic and confusion, with many attempting to evacuate amid warnings of further strikes. The strikes have resulted in significant civilian casualties, with over 200 reported deaths, including children. Iran has retaliated with missile and drone attacks on Israel, causing damage and casualties there as well.

Israel's endgame remains unclear, with Prime Minister Netanyahu stating the goal is to dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities, though he has mentioned the Iranian regime's weakness. Experts suggest that complete destruction of Iran's underground nuclear facilities will be challenging without U.S. support, as Israel lacks the necessary bunker-busting capabilities. The U.S. could be drawn into the conflict, especially if Israel's efforts fail, leading to potential military involvement, which could shut down any diplomatic avenues with Iran.

As the situation escalates, the implications for regional stability and U.S. interests are significant, with possible retaliation from Iran against U.S. forces in the region.
