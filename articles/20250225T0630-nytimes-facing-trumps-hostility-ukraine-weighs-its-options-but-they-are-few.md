## Article summary
The article discusses Ukraine's precarious position as it navigates the changing dynamics of U.S. support under President Trump, who has adopted a hostile stance towards Kyiv. With Trump initiating peace talks with Russia and dismissing Ukraine's role in negotiations, Ukrainian leaders are reassessing their options, realizing that U.S. backing may no longer be reliable. Ukraine is exploring economic deals to gain favor with Trump, but these come with the risk of unfavorable terms. As the war continues, Kyiv is pivoting toward Europe for support, engaging with European leaders to secure military assistance and potential peacekeeping troops.

Despite facing challenges on the battlefield, including troop shortages and exhaustion, Ukraine has ramped up domestic weapons production. Experts suggest that Ukraine's best strategy involves deepening ties with European partners while maintaining military resilience. The prospect of European funding and support is being discussed as a potential lifeline if U.S. assistance wanes. Ultimately, Ukraine's ability to endure without American support will be crucial in determining its future negotiations and military strategy. The article highlights the uncertainty and complexity of Ukraine's situation as it seeks to maintain sovereignty amid shifting international alliances.
