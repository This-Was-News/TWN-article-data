## Article summary
A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against President Trump's executive order to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a key agency providing federal funding to libraries and museums. The order aimed to eliminate several government entities, prompting a lawsuit from attorneys general in 21 states, who argued it violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Judge John J. McConnell Jr. emphasized the constitutional roles of Congress and the Executive in lawmaking and fund allocation. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha hailed the injunction as a victory for public interest, asserting that the Trump administration's actions hinder access to essential services. Established by Congress in 1996, the IMLS is crucial for funding public libraries, with a budget of $294 million in 2024. Following the executive order, the newly appointed acting director Keith E. Sonderling was installed, and agency employees faced administrative leave. Some states experienced grant rescissions, while others were left without staff to process funding. Additionally, a separate lawsuit has been filed by the American Library Association and AFSCME to challenge the dismantling of the IMLS.
