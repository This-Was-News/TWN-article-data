## Article summary
The Senate adjourned for its August recess without reaching an agreement to expedite the confirmation of President Donald Trump's nominees, following contentious negotiations between Senate leaders. Trump's public attack on Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, telling him to "GO TO HELL," effectively ended the negotiations. Republicans are considering changing Senate rules in September to speed up confirmations, while Democrats warn that such a move would be a mistake. The standoff is part of a broader trend of increased obstruction of nominees by both parties over the past two decades. Democrats have blocked more nominees than usual, forcing lengthy roll call votes, while Republicans have extended Senate sessions to confirm as many nominees as possible.
