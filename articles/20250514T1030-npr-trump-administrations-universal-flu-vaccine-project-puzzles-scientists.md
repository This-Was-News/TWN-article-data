## Article summary
The Trump administration has initiated a project called Generation Gold Standard aimed at developing a universal flu vaccine that wouldn't require annual updates for new virus strains. This ambitious project also seeks to protect against other respiratory viruses, such as bird flu and coronaviruses. Despite the potential benefits, many vaccine experts are puzzled by the choice to use an outdated technology involving a whole killed flu virus, which is seen as less effective and more prone to side effects compared to modern alternatives. The project's $500 million budget raises concerns, especially during a time of reduced federal health research funding; critics argue that such a significant investment should explore diverse technologies rather than focus on a single approach. The technology being used was developed by NIH scientists who hold patents on it, leading to questions about the transparency and review process behind the project's selection. Experts emphasize the need for an open scientific competition to ensure the best ideas are pursued. The administration claims that the vaccine could be ready for widespread testing within a year and available to the public in four years. However, the ambitious timeline and lack of independent review have sparked skepticism among researchers. Overall, while the goal of a universal flu vaccine is commendable, the methodology and funding strategy have raised significant concerns in the scientific community.
