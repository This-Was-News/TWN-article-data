## Article summary
The article discusses the recent announcement by the Trump administration regarding new tariffs, which include a 34% tax on imports from China and varying rates for other countries. It reveals how the administration calculated these tariffs, providing a straightforward answer to the question of how much prices will increase due to these tariffs. According to the administration's formula, the tariffs are designed to raise prices on foreign products, thereby discouraging American consumers from purchasing them and aiming to close the trade deficit.

The article breaks down the math behind these tariffs, stating that for every 10% increase in tariffs, prices are expected to rise by 2.5%. This means that a 67% tariff on Chinese goods could lead to a price increase of approximately 16.75%, which is anticipated to significantly reduce American purchases of these products. However, the article critiques the assumptions made in the administration's calculations, noting that previous tariffs have shown nearly all costs are passed onto consumers, contrary to the administration's estimate.

Moreover, it highlights the broader economic implications of these tariffs, including potential retaliatory measures from other countries and impacts on exchange rates. Ultimately, while the administration has provided its rationale, the effectiveness of these tariffs in actually closing the trade deficit remains uncertain.
