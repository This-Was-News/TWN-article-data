## Article summary
The death toll of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip has surpassed 50,000 since the onset of Israel's military campaign against Hamas, following a breakdown of a ceasefire. The Gaza Health Ministry reported that the toll reached 50,021 as of March 23, 2025. This escalation began after Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, resulting in significant casualties and hostages taken. In response, Israel initiated a military offensive aimed at dismantling Hamas and rescuing the captives.

Recently, Israel has ordered mass evacuations in southern Gaza as it expands its military actions, displacing many who had just returned home. Eyewitness accounts describe intense violence, with civilians caught in the crossfire. Negotiations to extend a previous ceasefire have faltered, with Israel imposing a blockade on essential supplies to pressure Hamas into compliance. The situation remains dire, with ongoing military operations and humanitarian concerns escalating amid the conflict.
