## Article summary
The article explores the complexities surrounding a potential ceasefire in Ukraine amidst ongoing discussions between U.S. officials and Russian representatives, notably without Ukrainian involvement. Experts express concerns that a ceasefire may leave Ukraine vulnerable to renewed Russian aggression, allowing Putin to regroup his forces. The piece highlights that Ukraine has shown resilience on the battlefield, but military aid from NATO has been crucial for its defense. 

Trump's recent rhetoric, which shifts blame onto Ukraine, raises fears that his administration may pressure Ukraine into a precarious peace deal. Analysts warn that a ceasefire could serve as a strategic pause for Russia, enabling it to legitimize its actions and potentially escalate conflict later. Historical precedents show that Russia has previously exploited ceasefires to its advantage, further complicating the trust needed for any peace agreement. 

The article emphasizes that without robust security guarantees, a ceasefire would not lead to lasting peace. The situation remains tense as both sides are reluctant to disclose casualty figures, and the international community continues to grapple with the implications of a potential ceasefire. Overall, the discourse suggests that the path to peace in Ukraine is fraught with risks and uncertainties.
