## Article summary
The U.S. government recently deported approximately 250 individuals, identified as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, to El Salvador, despite a federal court order prohibiting such actions. The deportations occurred under President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, which allows for the expedited removal of individuals deemed a threat during wartime or invasion. The legality of using this act for deportations is contested, as critics argue it has not been applied in peacetime and raises concerns about due process. Among those deported were members of the notorious MS-13 gang, which has historical ties to both the U.S. and El Salvador.

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed the arrival of these deportees, stating they would be held in a maximum-security facility known as CECOT. The U.S. Secretary of State praised the operation, emphasizing the removal of perceived threats to American safety. However, legal challenges have emerged, with the ACLU seeking to block the deportations, arguing that the individuals did not receive fair hearings. The situation raises significant questions about the jurisdiction of U.S. courts over deported individuals and the potential implications for immigration policy moving forward.
