## Article summary
The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has funded a diverse range of projects, from AI research to historical preservation, but recently terminated over a thousand grants across the U.S. This decision affects various initiatives, including the Center for Liberal Arts and AI at the University of Richmond, which aimed to explore the implications of AI on society. Critics argue that funding for the arts and humanities disproportionately benefits higher-income individuals, yet NEH grants have also targeted underserved communities. Programs like the Cultural and Community Resilience grant sought to protect cultural resources from climate change, but their future is uncertain due to funding cuts. Additionally, community colleges, such as Lone Star College, had received grants to enhance course offerings but now face disruptions. Filmmaker Yuriko Romer also lost significant funding for her documentary project, highlighting the challenges faced by creatives. The NEH's funding changes raise concerns about the support for crucial research and cultural initiatives in the U.S.
