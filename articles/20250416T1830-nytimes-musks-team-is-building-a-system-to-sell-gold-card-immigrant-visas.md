## Article summary
Elon Musk's team is developing a system to sell special immigration visas, referred to as gold cards, for $5 million each, as part of a shift from cost-cutting to revenue generation. This initiative, backed by President Trump, aims to provide a pathway to citizenship for high-net-worth individuals, replacing the EB-5 visa program. The project involves collaboration with various government agencies, including the State Department and Homeland Security, to streamline the visa application and vetting process. 

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed that 1,000 visas had been sold, although no money has changed hands yet. The gold card will allow holders permanent residency in the U.S. as long as they meet certain criteria. Musk's team is working on software to expedite the application process, potentially reducing the vetting time to two weeks. 

The project has faced controversy, particularly regarding Marko Elez, who resigned after being linked to racist posts online. Joe Gebbia, a co-founder of Airbnb, is also involved in the initiative. The gold card system is expected to be unveiled soon, with Trump showcasing a prototype card.
