## Article summary
The draft agreement for a U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal includes a vague reference to security guarantees, which Ukraine had strongly advocated for during negotiations. While the document states that the U.S. supports Ukraine's efforts to secure guarantees for lasting peace, it does not commit to specific actions for safeguarding Ukraine's security. President Trump has indicated that he will not extend extensive security guarantees, suggesting that Europe should take on that responsibility. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of including the phrase "security guarantee" in the agreement, viewing it as crucial for the deal's success. The draft also outlines Ukraine's commitment to sharing half of its future natural resource revenues with the U.S., which would control a fund related to these resources. Despite the inclusion of security language, U.S. officials previously resisted its addition, arguing that financial interests in Ukrainian resources imply security commitments. The negotiations reflect Ukraine's precarious position, balancing between U.S. support and potential Russian influence. Zelensky stated that Ukraine would continue military efforts unless a cease-fire included security guarantees. The deal is seen as a potential avenue for ongoing U.S. backing under the Trump administration, especially amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.
