## Article summary
Israel has resumed airstrikes in Gaza following stalled cease-fire negotiations with Hamas. These strikes, which resulted in significant casualties, appear aimed at pressuring Hamas to compromise on the release of hostages. Although Israel has not initiated a ground invasion, analysts suggest that the strikes are a tactic to gauge Hamas's response before escalating military action. The Israeli government has been cautious in its statements, avoiding specifics about the duration or nature of the military operations. Hamas condemned the attacks, asserting that they jeopardize the fate of remaining hostages and hold Israel responsible for violating the cease-fire agreement. Israeli officials, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have expressed a desire to destroy Hamas, indicating a shift in military strategy. The situation remains tense, with concerns that ongoing airstrikes could lead to a prolonged conflict without significant changes in Hamas's stance. As of now, Hamas has not retaliated, possibly due to weakened military capabilities or a strategic choice to avoid further escalation. The developments mark the first major military action since a cease-fire was established nearly two months prior.
