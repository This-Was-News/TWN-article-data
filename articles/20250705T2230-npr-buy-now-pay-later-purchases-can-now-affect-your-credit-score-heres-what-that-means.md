## Article summary
FICO has announced that it will start incorporating data from buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans into some of its credit scores, reflecting the growing popularity of this payment option. BNPL allows consumers to split purchases into installments, often interest-free if paid on time, and has been widely adopted, particularly among low- and middle-income individuals, women, and younger generations. While this change may help generate credit scores for first-time users and potentially improve scores for responsible users, late payments could negatively impact credit scores. The effect on most consumers is expected to be minor, with changes typically within 10 points. The inclusion of BNPL data aims to provide lenders with a fuller picture of a consumer's financial situation, addressing previous blind spots. However, BNPL loans lack the same consumer protections as credit cards, particularly regarding disputes over payments. Although recent regulations have aimed to enhance protections for BNPL users, enforcement of these rules has been uncertain. Consumers are advised to manage their payments carefully, as responsible credit utilization remains crucial for maintaining a good FICO score. Overall, while the integration of BNPL data is a significant shift, its impact on credit scores and consumer behavior may vary.
