## Article summary
The Senate is debating a package of funding cuts requested by President Trump, targeting $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and $7.9 billion for international aid. The vote was narrowly advanced with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance, as some Republicans joined Democrats in opposition. The cuts to CPB, which funds NPR and PBS, remain, but negotiations ensured continued funding for 28 Native American radio stations through a reallocation of funds. Senators raised concerns about the impact of the cuts on local public media and the lack of transparency in the rescission package. The package, if approved, will return to the House for a final vote, with a deadline of midnight Friday.
