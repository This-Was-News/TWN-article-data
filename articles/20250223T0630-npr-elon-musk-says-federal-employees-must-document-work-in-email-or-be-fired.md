## Article summary
Elon Musk has issued an ultimatum to federal employees, requiring them to document their work via email or face termination. An email from the Office of Personnel Management requested employees to outline their accomplishments from the previous week, with a deadline set for Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET. Musk's directive aligns with President Trump's push for a more efficient federal workforce and follows a trend of mass firings affecting at least 20,000 government workers recently. 

Labor experts suggest that while outright termination for non-compliance may not be legal due to civil service protections, employees could still face disciplinary actions. Confusion among federal workers arose as some agencies advised caution in responding to the emails, indicating the request's legitimacy while also highlighting sensitive operational matters. The American Federation of Government Employees condemned Musk's actions, calling them disrespectful to civil servants, including veterans. 

Musk's management style mirrors tactics he has employed in his private companies, where he has previously mandated similar productivity reports. The situation underscores ongoing tensions between the new administration and federal employees, emphasizing the challenges of accountability and efficiency in government operations.
