## Article summary
Israel has halted the delivery of aid to Gaza until Hamas agrees to a U.S. proposal for extending a ceasefire. This decision comes after Hamas reportedly refused to accept the extension, which was part of a deal aimed at securing the release of Israeli hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of its hostages and warned of "further consequences" if Hamas continues its refusal. The current ceasefire, which began on January 19, was intended to facilitate the release of hostages and improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where many people depend on aid. 

Israel claims that nearly 21,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began, helping alleviate severe food shortages. However, Hamas accused Israel of using blackmail tactics and violating the ceasefire agreement. The first phase of the ceasefire coincided with the beginning of Ramadan, marking a significant moment for the people in Gaza who have endured prolonged conflict. As negotiations for the second phase stalled, tensions remain high, with both sides blaming each other for the deadlock. The situation is dire, with many in Gaza facing famine-like conditions as aid supplies dwindle.
