## Article summary
The political landscape for Republicans following recent elections indicates potential challenges ahead, particularly due to President Trump's new tariffs and the economic downturn they may trigger. Despite the Republican party's expectations of a mandate post-election, Democratic voter engagement remains strong, suggesting that major Democratic victories could continue into the upcoming midterm elections. Trump's tariffs introduce significant risks, as historical trends show that economic downturns can lead to severe political consequences for any party in power. His support has already waned, with declining approval ratings and growing dissatisfaction regarding economic issues, particularly inflation. Some Republican senators are expressing concern over Trump's tariff policies, signaling unusual opposition within the party. If the economic fallout from the tariffs is severe, it could jeopardize Republican control in traditionally safe states and complicate their support for Trump. Overall, the initial optimism following the election is giving way to uncertainty about the party's future and Trump's political viability. The document suggests that the anticipated golden age for Republicans may be further out of reach than previously thought.
