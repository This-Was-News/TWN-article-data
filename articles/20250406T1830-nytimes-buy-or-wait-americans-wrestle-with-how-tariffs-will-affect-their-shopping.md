## Article summary
The announcement of President Trump's tariffs has prompted many Americans to adjust their shopping habits in anticipation of rising prices. Retirees Charlene and Phil Willingham rushed to replace their old kitchen appliances, fearing cost increases due to the tariffs. Shoppers across the country expressed a mix of urgency and anxiety, with some, like Shali Santos, stocking up on essentials, while others remained calm, trusting that the economy would stabilize. Concerns about rising costs were often linked to political affiliations, with some Democrats viewing the tariffs as harmful to the economy and urging others to buy before prices increase. In contrast, many Trump supporters felt no need to change their purchasing behaviors, believing the tariffs would ultimately benefit U.S. manufacturing. As uncertainty looms over the economic impact of the tariffs, shoppers are grappling with the immediate effects on their finances, including declining retirement savings. Overall, the tariffs have created a sense of urgency among consumers, yet opinions about their long-term effects vary widely.
