## Article summary
Speaker Mike Johnson is facing challenges in passing President Trump's policy bill, relying on Trump's influence to rally support within a divided Republican Conference. Despite his inexperience and skepticism from some Republicans, Johnson has previously succeeded by leveraging Trump's involvement, often holding meetings at the White House to quell dissent. On a recent occasion, he faced significant pushback from hard-line conservatives and concerns from moderate lawmakers regarding cuts to social programs. Trump's personal engagement has proven effective, as he has previously convinced reluctant members to support key legislation. Johnson's latest hurdle involves a sweeping policy package that cannot be amended without risking its passage. He is attempting to reassure holdouts by promising future adjustments and emphasizing the party's commitment to fiscal responsibility. The outcome of this legislation is critical for Johnson's leadership and the Republican agenda moving forward.
