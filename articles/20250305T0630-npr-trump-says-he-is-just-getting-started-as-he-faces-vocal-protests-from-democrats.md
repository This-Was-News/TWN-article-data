## Article summary
President Trump addressed a divided Congress, proclaiming that he is "just getting started" and asserting an electoral mandate amid vocal protests from Democrats. His speech, marked by interruptions and jeers, highlighted his administration's early actions, including cutting foreign aid, banning trans athletes in school sports, and plans to streamline government efficiency. Trump claimed that America's momentum and pride are returning, while simultaneously blaming former President Biden for rising costs, particularly in food and energy. He emphasized a focus on illegal immigration, calling for funding to secure the U.S.-Mexico border and proposing severe penalties for those who kill police officers.

During the address, Trump announced new tariffs on major trading partners, which he argued would benefit the U.S. economy despite potential retaliatory actions. He briefly mentioned a paused aid package to Ukraine but did not elaborate on a critical minerals deal with the country. The Democratic response, delivered by Sen. Elissa Slotkin, criticized Trump's economic policies and emphasized the importance of democracy. Overall, the address showcased stark partisan divisions, with Trump's supporters and opponents reacting distinctly throughout the speech.
