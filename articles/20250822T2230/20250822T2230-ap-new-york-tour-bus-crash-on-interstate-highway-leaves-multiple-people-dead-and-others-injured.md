## Article summary
A tour bus carrying 52 people crashed and rolled on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, killing multiple passengers and injuring others. The bus lost control, ejecting passengers as windows shattered. Children were among those on board. The bus was traveling eastbound when it veered into the median and ended up in a ditch. Most passengers were of Indian, Chinese, and Filipino ethnicity. The driver is alive and cooperating with authorities, who believe they understand why the bus lost control. Medical services transported injured passengers, with injuries ranging from head trauma to broken bones. Two people required surgery but are expected to recover. The bus was heavily damaged, and many passengers were ejected due to not wearing seat belts. A 2023 state law requires seat belt use on charter buses built after November 28, 2016, but the age of the bus in this crash is unknown. The roadway was shut down in both directions, and Governor Kathy Hochul was briefed on the accident.
