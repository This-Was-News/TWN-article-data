## Article summary
U.S. President Donald Trump initially announced a diplomatic breakthrough, arranging for direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov later stated that no meeting was planned, as Putin would only meet Zelenskyy after key issues were resolved, indicating a significant setback for Trump's efforts. Trump expressed frustration and hinted at potential new sanctions or tariffs on Russia if talks did not proceed. European leaders had initially cheered Trump's optimistic tone but grew uncertain as Russian officials raised objections to the proposed negotiations. Meanwhile, Russia launched one of its largest aerial assaults this year, targeting western Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to avoid peace talks, while NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte discussed potential security guarantees for Ukraine. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that discussing Ukrainian concessions to Putin was a trap, emphasizing that Russia had made no concessions and continued its aggression. Despite Trump's calls for an end to the killing, Putin has escalated attacks, highlighting the ongoing challenges in achieving peace.
