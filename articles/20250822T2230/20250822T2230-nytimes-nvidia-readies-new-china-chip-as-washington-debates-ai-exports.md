## Article summary
Nvidia is developing a new chip for China amid ongoing debates on AI exports. The company has started phasing out production of its current chip designed for Chinese companies, the H20, and is working on a more powerful successor. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, announced a new product for AI data centers, which will be a modified version of their cutting-edge chips to comply with U.S. regulations. Huang is seeking approval from the Trump administration to sell this new chip. The U.S. government is considering limiting AI chip sales to China to maintain a competitive edge in AI technology and prevent potential military use. Chinese authorities have discouraged the purchase of H20 chips due to concerns over security risks. Nvidia is managing its supply chain to address market conditions, and the company's plans for China have sparked division in Washington. The Trump administration and some congressional leaders are at odds over global AI chip sales, weighing the balance between economic interests and national security.
