## Article summary
Ellen Allen, a 63-year-old from West Virginia, faces a significant increase in her Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance premiums, rising from $479 to $2,800 per month next year due to the expiration of federal tax credits. She relies on her insurance to cover expensive medications, including a $800 monthly eye drop to prevent blindness. Allen is setting aside money to prepare for the increased costs, which will also impact her retirement savings. She will only have to pay the high premiums for eight or nine months before qualifying for Medicare at age 65. Meanwhile, Sydny Clifton, a 54-year-old from Florida, also faces rising premiums and may need to seek a job with health benefits or consider remarriage for insurance coverage. The end of the enhanced tax credits is expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans by 4.2 million over the next decade, with many healthy individuals opting to go without insurance.
