## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, along with Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore and Rear Adm. Milton Sands, following an intelligence assessment of U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites that angered President Donald Trump. The assessment, which leaked to the media, contradicted Trump's claims that Iran's nuclear program was completely destroyed, stating it was only set back a few months. Trump has a history of distrusting intelligence assessments and has taken actions against the intelligence community and military leadership. Critics argue that these actions could chill dissent and signal that intelligence should align with Trump's interests. The firings come amid broader changes in the intelligence community and military leadership, including staff and budget cuts at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the early retirement of the Air Force's top uniformed officer. Hegseth and Trump have been aggressive in dismissing top military officials, often without formal explanation. Democrats in Congress have raised alarms over the precedent set by Kruse's ouster, suggesting it creates an atmosphere of fear within the intelligence community.
