## Article summary
The Trump administration announced it will not defend a decades-old grant program for colleges with large Hispanic student populations, deeming it unconstitutional. The Justice Department agrees with a lawsuit challenging the grants, which are reserved for institutions where at least 25% of undergraduates are Hispanic. The program, created in 1998 to address lower college graduation rates among Latino students, is now considered racially discriminatory by the administration. Tennessee and a conservative legal group, Students for Fair Admissions, sued to halt the program, arguing it unfairly excludes public universities that serve Hispanic students but do not meet the ethnic threshold. The Justice Department cited a 2023 Supreme Court decision that racial balancing is unconstitutional. Over 500 colleges qualify for these grants, which totaled $350 million in 2024. Former President Joe Biden prioritized Hispanic-serving institutions, but President Trump revoked related executive actions. Despite Trump's budget request preserving the grants, doubts remain about his administration's commitment. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities intervened in the lawsuit, citing concerns over inadequate federal representation. The grants aim to address funding disparities, as Hispanic-serving institutions enroll 67% of Latino undergraduates but receive less funding than other institutions. The Justice Department can refuse to defend laws it deems unconstitutional, as seen in past administrations. The Trump administration has opposed diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, arguing they discriminate against white and Asian Americans.
