## Article summary
The real estate market is showing slight improvement after a slowdown caused by high mortgage rates. Sales of existing homes rose 2% in July, with about 4 million homes expected to be sold this year, though this is lower than pre-pandemic levels. Inventory has increased significantly, offering more options for buyers but extending the time homes stay on the market. Prices are softening in many areas, with declines in the South and West, though the national median price remains high at $422,400. High mortgage rates, averaging 6.6%, and increased home prices have made affordability a major challenge. Recent slight drops in mortgage rates have spurred refinance activity, particularly for homeowners with rates above 7%. Future mortgage rates will be influenced by Federal Reserve decisions and economic factors. Despite some movement, many homeowners are reluctant to move due to low pandemic-era mortgage rates, contributing to a sluggish market. However, rising inventory levels indicate some movement, and housing starts were up 5% in July, though building permits declined. Affordability, labor shortages, and regulatory costs remain significant challenges for the housing market.
