## Article summary
The Justice Department released the complete transcript and audio recording of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's conversations with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's longtime partner, who was sentenced to 20 years for her role in Epstein's abuse of underage girls. The interviews, conducted in Tallahassee, Florida, covered Maxwell's interactions with various officials, including President Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Maxwell stated she met Trump in 1990, found him cordial, and never witnessed any inappropriate behavior. She also denied any inappropriate activity involving Clinton, noting their only interactions were on Epstein's plane. The interviews discussed Epstein's connections with influential figures like Bill Gates, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy. Maxwell's legal team appears to be seeking clemency, and she was recently transferred to a minimum-security prison in Texas. The transcript release coincides with the Justice Department sharing files from its Epstein and Maxwell probes with the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make some records public.
