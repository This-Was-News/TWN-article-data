## Article summary
Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend, denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior by Donald Trump during her interviews with the Justice Department. The Trump administration released transcripts of these interviews, aiming to distance the president from Epstein. Maxwell praised Trump and denied seeing him in any compromising situations, stating he was always a gentleman. She recalled knowing Trump since the 1990s and visiting his Mar-a-Lago estate but hadn't seen him since the mid-2000s. Maxwell also denied ever hearing about Trump engaging in inappropriate activities with anyone. She was interviewed over two days last month by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Meanwhile, the Justice Department began sending records from the Epstein investigation to the House Oversight Committee. The case has drawn public attention due to Epstein's social connections to prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, and Trump. Maxwell also defended Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton, dismissing allegations against them. She sought to distance herself from Epstein's conduct, denying allegations about her role in his activities. Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges and was found dead in his jail cell a month later.
