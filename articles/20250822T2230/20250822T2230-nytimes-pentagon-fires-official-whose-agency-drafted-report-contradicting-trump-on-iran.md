## Article summary
The Pentagon has fired the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, weeks after the agency's preliminary report contradicted President Trump's claims about the impact of U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. This marks the second top military intelligence official to be removed since Trump's return to office. Senator Mark Warner criticized the firing, stating that it underscores the administration's habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test. The White House faced backlash after the agency's assessment suggested Iran's nuclear program was only set back by months, contrary to the administration's narrative. General Kruse's firing was reportedly due to a loss of confidence by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The agency's deputy director, Christine Bordne, will serve as acting director until a replacement is approved. Former senior intelligence officials noted that General Kruse had been targeted since early in the Trump administration, with some officials wanting to replace military leaders appointed by former President Biden. The Defense Intelligence Agency, created to be the military's primary intelligence source, has faced criticism for being bloated and having ill-defined missions. The agency's development of a database tool, MARS, has also been a point of contention within the administration.
