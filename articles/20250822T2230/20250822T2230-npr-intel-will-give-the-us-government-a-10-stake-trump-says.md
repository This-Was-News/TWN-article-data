## Article summary
President Trump announced that Intel CEO Lp-Bu Tan agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in Intel during a White House meeting. The government will invest $8.9 billion in Intel common stock, with part of the funding coming from CHIPS and Science Act grants and the Defense Department's Secure Enclave program. The deal, confirmed by Intel, includes the government purchasing 433.3 million shares at $20.47 per share, equating to a 9.9% stake, with no board representation or governance rights. Trump called it a 'great deal' for both the U.S. and Intel, marking an unusual step in the administration's efforts to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Intel, facing recent challenges and competition from Nvda, plans to invest over $28 billion in Ohio chip facilities, though demand remains uncertain. The deal follows Trump's earlier call for Intel's CEO to resign over investments in Chinese tech companies. Analysts question the long-term impact of the equity deal on Intel's future and its ability to lead the semiconductor industry.
