## Article summary
The Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced significant changes under the Trump administration that are raising concerns among advocates for seniors and people with disabilities. Proposed measures include cutting 7,000 jobs, closing regional offices, and implementing stricter identity verification processes that may require in-person visits. Advocates warn these changes could complicate access to essential benefits, with many already experiencing long wait times and administrative difficulties. 

Aaron Woods shared his struggles to help his mother navigate her Social Security and Medicare benefits, highlighting the dire consequences of bureaucratic inefficiency. Critics argue that the SSA has long faced challenges in managing its workload and that these cuts could exacerbate existing issues. The agency's leadership maintains that restructuring will enhance service delivery, but many fear it will hinder problem resolution for beneficiaries. 

Advocacy groups emphasize that the decentralization of services is vital for efficient operations, and the planned cuts could lead to a significant backlog. The SSA's new identity verification rules have also been met with backlash, as they may create additional barriers for beneficiaries. Overall, there is growing concern that these changes could undermine public support for Social Security and lead to a "system collapse."
