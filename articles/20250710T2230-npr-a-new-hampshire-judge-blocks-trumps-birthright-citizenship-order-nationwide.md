## Article summary
A federal judge in Concord, New Hampshire, blocked President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship nationwide, granting a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of three non-citizen parents. Judge Joseph Laplante found the government's arguments unpersuasive and ruled that the order posed a threat of irreparable harm to children. The ruling applies to babies born to undocumented immigrants and people with temporary status across the country, as Laplante granted class action status to the plaintiffs. The decision follows a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that limited the scope of nationwide injunctions, but left the door open for class action lawsuits. Laplante's ruling includes a seven-day stay to allow for appeals and slightly narrows the protected class to only include babies born to undocumented parents, not the parents themselves.
