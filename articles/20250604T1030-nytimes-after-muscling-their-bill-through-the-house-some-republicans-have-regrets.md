## Article summary
Some House Republicans are expressing regret after narrowly passing Trump's domestic policy bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Initially celebrating their victory, lawmakers have since realized that the extensive legislation included provisions they were unaware of, such as limiting judges' powers and blocking state regulation of artificial intelligence for a decade. Representative Mike Flood admitted he would have voted differently had he known about these measures, while Marjorie Taylor Greene echoed similar sentiments on social media. The bill, comprising 1,037 pages, was rushed through Congress with little time for thorough review, as it was finalized just hours before the vote. Critics, including Elon Musk, described the legislation as excessive and filled with unnecessary provisions. Both Greene and Flood are urging Republican senators to remove the concerning sections, which may conflict with legislative rules requiring direct effects on federal revenues. Democrats have criticized the Republicans for not adequately reviewing the bill, highlighting their objections during the debate. Flood acknowledged the backlash from constituents, admitting he was unaware of certain provisions when he voted. The situation underscores the challenges of legislating in a polarized environment where large bills often include unrelated measures.
