## Article summary
The travel ban announced by President Trump has introduced a new hardship for citizens of war-torn nations, particularly Myanmar, which is grappling with a military coup, civil war, and other crises. The ban targets countries deemed to have significant terrorist presence, affecting nations like Afghanistan, Chad, and Yemen, and restricts entry for those seeking refuge in the U.S. Many affected individuals, including those like Ko Min Nwe, who won a U.S. immigration lottery, feel their hopes for a better life have been dashed. Critics argue that the ban is not primarily about national security but rather about dividing communities seeking safety. Exceptions exist for certain visa categories, including special visas for Afghans who assisted U.S. forces, but many vulnerable populations remain at risk. The situation in Myanmar is dire, with millions displaced and a lack of evidence linking the country to terrorism, despite ongoing violence and repression. The U.S. has previously supported refugee resettlement initiatives, but these efforts have stalled under the new restrictions. Young people like Ma Mya Thiri Lwin, who aspired to study in the U.S., now face bleak futures in their home country. Overall, the travel ban represents a significant setback for those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum in the United States.
