## Article summary
President Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza has gained traction in Israel, with ultranationalist lawmakers actively discussing plans for such a migration. Israeli officials are reportedly working on establishing a migration authority to facilitate the relocation of Gaza's two million residents, with surveys indicating that a majority of Israelis are receptive to the idea. However, Arab nations have condemned the proposal as ethnic cleansing, and Trump has stated he would not enforce it after receiving pushback from Egypt and Jordan.

The discourse around the idea of expelling Palestinians, once considered extreme, has shifted significantly, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu now praising it as "revolutionary." Some Israeli lawmakers argue that relocating Gazans is necessary for both humanitarian and security reasons, citing the dangers posed by the ongoing conflict. Nonetheless, there is skepticism about the practicality of the plan, with many Israelis acknowledging potential backlash and ethical concerns about displacing a population.

While some Palestinians express a willingness to leave for better opportunities, others firmly reject the notion of being uprooted from their homes. The discussion has sparked a broader conversation in Israel about possible solutions to the ongoing conflict, indicating a significant shift in political sentiments regarding the future of Gaza and its inhabitants.
