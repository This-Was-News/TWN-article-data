## Article summary
At a town hall meeting in Acworth, Georgia, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene faced significant disruptions from protesters, resulting in multiple arrests and the use of stun guns by police. The event, which took place on April 16, 2025, saw Greene interrupted repeatedly as she discussed President Trump's agenda and addressed pre-selected questions. Attendees chanted slogans and shouted insults, leading to the ejection of several protesters by law enforcement. The Acworth Police Department had anticipated potential disruptions and pre-screened attendees, with three individuals ultimately arrested for various offenses, including battery and obstruction. Greene praised the police response, asserting that protests should occur at the ballot box rather than at town halls. Similar tensions were reported at other lawmakers' events, indicating a broader trend of constituents expressing frustration over political issues. Some Republican officials are now opting for virtual town halls or canceling in-person meetings due to safety concerns. Democrats, in contrast, are increasing their town hall efforts in response to the GOP's challenges. Overall, the event underscores the growing confrontational atmosphere at political gatherings across the country.
