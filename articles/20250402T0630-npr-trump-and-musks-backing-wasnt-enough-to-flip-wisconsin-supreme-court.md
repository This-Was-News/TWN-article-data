## Article summary
Susan Crawford has won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, defeating Brad Schimel, who was backed by Elon Musk and endorsed by Donald Trump. This election maintained the court's 4-3 liberal majority, signaling a significant outcome in a race projected to be the most expensive state supreme court election ever, with spending exceeding $100 million. Crawford's victory reflects strong support from national Democrats, including substantial contributions from figures like Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and George Soros. 

Key issues before the court include abortion rights and potential redistricting, with Musk suggesting that the court's decisions could impact Republican representation in the U.S. House. Crawford, who has a history of advocating for reproductive and voting rights, criticized the financial backing her opponent received from Musk, declaring her triumph over "the richest man in the world." Schimel conceded the race, acknowledging the results despite some dissent from his supporters. 

Crawford will be sworn in for a ten-year term starting August 1, and her election is seen as a reflection of voter sentiment in a critical swing state. The outcome also highlights the influence of substantial financial contributions in judicial elections, with both candidates attempting to portray their opponent as beholden to their donors.
