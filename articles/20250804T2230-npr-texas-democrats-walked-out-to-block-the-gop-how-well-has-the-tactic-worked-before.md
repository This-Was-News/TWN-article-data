## Article summary
More than 50 Texas Democratic lawmakers left the state to block the passage of a controversial redistricting map aimed at adding more Republican congressional seats. This tactic, known as "breaking quorum," requires the presence of a minimum number of lawmakers to conduct legislative business. While this strategy can delay legislation and draw attention to the issue, it is not guaranteed to block the legislation permanently, as the governor can call repeated special sessions. Historical examples show mixed results, with some walkouts leading to temporary delays but ultimately failing to prevent the passage of the legislation. The walkouts also tend to exacerbate political tensions and can result in professional consequences for the lawmakers involved.
