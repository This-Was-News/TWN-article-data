## Article summary
Columbia University faculty members are protesting the university's recent concessions to the Trump administration, which welcomed these changes as a positive step in maintaining federal funding. The concessions include tightening disciplinary procedures and increasing administrative control over academic departments, particularly in response to claims of antisemitism linked to pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Columbia faces potential loss of approximately $400 million in federal research funding, prompting these changes to avoid repercussions.

Federal officials, including Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, have expressed support for Columbia's actions, but emphasized the need for ongoing commitment to combating antisemitism on campus. In contrast, about 50 professors rallied against the university's response, arguing that it undermines academic freedom and shared governance. They drew parallels between the situation at Columbia and actions taken by authoritarian regimes, expressing concerns over the concentration of power in the university's administration.

The changes include oversight of the Columbia University Judicial Board by the administration and a new vice provost to review curriculum and hiring processes. Faculty members, while acknowledging the slower pace of institutional responses, are organizing to advocate for academic independence and resist what they perceive as political pressures. The ongoing tensions reflect broader debates about academic freedom and the influence of government on university policies.
