## Article summary
Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian actress, was detained by U.S. immigration authorities for 12 days after attempting to apply for a TN visa at the U.S.-Mexico border. Despite having previously crossed the border without issue, she was unexpectedly taken into custody, where she experienced harsh conditions, including being held in a cold holding cell for 48 hours. Mooney's detention was part of a broader trend of abrupt arrests under a rapidly changing immigration system. During her time in detention, she met many women who, like her, had no criminal records and were seeking better lives in the U.S. 

Upon her release, she felt compelled to share her story, emphasizing the privilege she had in receiving media coverage and legal support that many detainees lacked. Mooney highlighted the importance of using her voice to advocate for others still caught in the system. She also reflected on the stories of women she met who had fled persecution and were desperate for safety. Mooney's experience has motivated her to raise awareness about the injustices within the immigration system and the need for change.
