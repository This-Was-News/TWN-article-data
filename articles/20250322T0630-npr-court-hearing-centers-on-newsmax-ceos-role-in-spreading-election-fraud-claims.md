## Article summary
A recent court hearing focused on Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy's involvement in promoting false election-fraud claims, as part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against the network. Dominion is seeking damages, claiming that Newsmax knowingly aired false information about voter fraud, similar to a previous case with Fox News that resulted in a nearly $800 million settlement. During the hearing, evidence was presented showing Ruddy's active role in the network's coverage, including his communications regarding controversial guests like Sidney Powell, who has been linked to conspiracy theories about election fraud.

Dominion's attorneys argued that Newsmax executives were aware of the unreliability of their guests while continuing to promote their claims for ratings. Newsmax contends that its hosts are responsible for their statements and that the company itself was not directly involved in the content aired. The hearing aims to determine whether the case will proceed to a jury trial, scheduled for next month.

Ruddy defended Newsmax's coverage as balanced, asserting that the court's presentation of evidence was selective. The lawsuit highlights the broader implications for media outlets and the challenges of proving defamation, particularly regarding "actual malice." The judge overseeing the case is expected to issue a ruling soon, which could significantly impact Newsmax's financial future.
