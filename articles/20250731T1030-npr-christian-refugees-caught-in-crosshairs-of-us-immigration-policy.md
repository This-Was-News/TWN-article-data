## Article summary
The document discusses the challenges faced by Christian refugees, particularly Iranians, under the Trump administration's immigration policies. Pastor Ara Torosan advocates for his congregants detained by ICE, highlighting the danger they face if deported back to Iran due to religious persecution. The Trump administration's overhaul of asylum and refugee systems has impacted those fleeing religious persecution, despite the White House's claim of support for persecuted Christians worldwide. The document notes that while some Christian refugees have been granted asylum, many others, including Afghans, face deportation and potential persecution. Advocates and faith leaders are calling for broader protections and exceptions to Trump's deportation policies, with some taking actions like silent protests and meetings with Congress.
