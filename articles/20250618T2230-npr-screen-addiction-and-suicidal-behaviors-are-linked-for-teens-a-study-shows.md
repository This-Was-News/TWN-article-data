## Article summary
A recent study published in JAMA reveals a significant link between screen addiction and increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors among teenagers. Analyzing data from over 4,000 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, researchers found that by age 14, many teens exhibited signs of addiction to social media, mobile phones, and video games. Those with higher levels of addiction were found to be 2 to 3 times more likely to report suicidal thoughts and behaviors, while total screen time alone did not correlate with suicide risk. The study utilized standardized questionnaires to assess addiction symptoms, such as preoccupation and inability to reduce usage. Experts emphasize the importance of distinguishing between screen time and screen addiction, noting that the latter is a more nuanced indicator of mental health risk. Avoidance behaviors, such as using screens to escape problems, were highlighted as red flags for anxiety and depression. Overall, the findings underscore the need for parents, educators, and clinicians to monitor signs of screen addiction in teens to mitigate potential mental health risks.
