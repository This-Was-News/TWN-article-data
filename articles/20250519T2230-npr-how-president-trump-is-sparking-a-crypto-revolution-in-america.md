## Article summary
The article discusses how President Trump is initiating a significant shift in the perception and regulation of cryptocurrency in the U.S., moving from skepticism to promotion. Under his administration, financial regulators and Congress are increasingly embracing crypto, contrasting with the previous Biden administration's approach. Coinbase's upcoming inclusion in the S&P 500 marks a pivotal moment for the industry, signaling its mainstream acceptance. Trump himself has launched a meme coin and has family members involved in crypto ventures, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. While crypto advocates celebrate this newfound legitimacy, critics warn of the inherent volatility and risks, fearing a potential financial crisis akin to 2008. The SEC has also changed its stance, easing regulations that previously targeted crypto companies. Consumer advocates express frustration over the rollback of investor protections, likening the current situation to past financial disasters. Overall, Trump's administration is seen as ushering in a new era for cryptocurrency, with both opportunities and significant risks for American investors.
