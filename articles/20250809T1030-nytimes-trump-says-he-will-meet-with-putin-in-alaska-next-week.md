## Article summary
President Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next Friday to discuss a potential peace deal for the war between Russia and Ukraine. Trump suggested that a peace agreement might involve territorial exchanges, indicating the U.S. could support Russia's efforts to compel Ukraine to cede some land. The meeting, the first in-person summit between American and Russian presidents since 2021, is seen as a diplomatic victory for Putin, who has been isolated from the international community. However, Ukrainian leaders strongly oppose ceding any territory, and constitutional constraints prevent President Volodymyr Zelensky from doing so. The meeting faces numerous challenges, including political and military hurdles, security guarantees for Ukraine, and the future of frozen Russian assets. Trump has not provided many details about the meeting or the potential territorial exchanges. Senator Lindsey Graham praised Trump's decision to meet with Putin, comparing it to Reagan's meetings with Gorbachev. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that the U.S. understands Russia's demands but acknowledged significant gaps between Russian and Ukrainian positions. Even if the meeting is successful, many complex issues, such as security guarantees and arms limitations, would need to be resolved. Trump has oscillated in his approach to Russia, initially showing deference to Putin but recently criticizing him for prolonging the conflict.
