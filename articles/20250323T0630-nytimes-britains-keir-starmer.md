## Article summary
Keir Starmer, the British Prime Minister, has emphasized the urgent need for Europe and the U.S. to strengthen their alliance amidst rising tensions with Russia and the implications of Donald Trump's presidency. During a recent visit to a nuclear submarine, Starmer reflected on the importance of Britain's military capabilities as a deterrent against potential conflicts, particularly with Russia. He acknowledged the shifting dynamics in transatlantic relations and the necessity for European nations to contribute more to their collective defense, a point Trump has raised. 

Starmer is pursuing the formation of a multinational military coalition to ensure Ukraine's security in any future peace negotiations, expressing distrust in Putin's intentions. He has actively engaged with Trump, aiming to maintain a strong bilateral relationship while navigating the complexities of NATO and European defense. Despite facing domestic challenges, including economic issues and a backlash over certain policies, Starmer's leadership during this geopolitical crisis has bolstered his approval ratings. 

He has committed to increasing military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, although the financial implications of this pledge remain uncertain. Starmer's efforts reflect a desire to restore Britain's role on the global stage following Brexit, positioning the country as a key player in addressing European security concerns.
