## Article summary
A Louisiana immigration judge has ruled that activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported, following a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Khalil's protests against antisemitism fostered a hostile environment for Jewish students. Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student, was detained after Rubio cited concerns about Khalil's activities undermining U.S. foreign policy against antisemitism. During the hearing, Judge Jamee Comans stated she could not challenge Rubio's decision and granted Khalil until April 23 to request a stay of his deportation. If his attorneys miss this deadline, he faces deportation to either Syria or Algeria.

Khalil expressed dissatisfaction with the process, claiming it lacked due process and fairness. His attorneys have indicated they plan to appeal the ruling. Khalil, who holds a green card and is a lawful permanent resident, was arrested on March 8 and has been held at the Jena/LaSalle Detention Facility since then. The case highlights the use of a rarely invoked federal statute from the 1950s, which allows the Secretary of State to determine if a noncitizen's presence threatens U.S. foreign policy. Khalil's situation raises concerns about the implications for free speech and activism in the U.S.
