## Article summary
A measles outbreak has significantly impacted Seminole, a small town in West Texas, where the vaccination rate among kindergarteners is only 82%, well below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. The outbreak, which began in late January, has resulted in 159 confirmed cases and one death of an unvaccinated child. Local health officials are mobilizing efforts to provide vaccinations and information, particularly to the area's large immigrant population, many of whom have uncertain immunization records. The outbreak has primarily affected children, with the Mennonite community being notably impacted, although many families rely on home remedies rather than vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy has been exacerbated by misinformation and the perception that measles is no longer a significant threat, leading to lower vaccination rates. Health officials stress the importance of vaccination to prevent severe complications from measles, which can spread easily and remain contagious even when individuals are asymptomatic. As of now, only 214 people have been vaccinated since the outbreak started, highlighting the challenges faced in combating misinformation. The situation underscores the critical need for community awareness and access to reliable health information.
