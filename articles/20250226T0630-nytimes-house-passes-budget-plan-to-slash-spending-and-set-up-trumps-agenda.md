## Article summary
The House of Representatives has passed a Republican budget resolution that proposes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a $2 trillion reduction in federal spending over the next decade. This narrow vote, which was 217 to 215, sets the stage for significant elements of President Trump's domestic agenda while igniting internal conflicts within the G.O.P. about which federal programs to cut. Speaker Mike Johnson, with Trump's support, faced challenges from both centrist Republicans concerned about Medicaid cuts and conservatives demanding deeper reductions.

The budget plan is the first step toward a larger fiscal package that could bypass a Senate filibuster through reconciliation. The resolution does not specify which taxes will be reduced or which programs will face cuts, though Medicaid and food aid programs are targeted. It also includes provisions for increased funding for border enforcement and defense.

Democrats argue that the proposed budget could add approximately $3 trillion to the deficit, while Republicans counter that failing to extend 2017 tax cuts would lead to tax increases for many families. The plan requires the Energy and Commerce Committee to identify at least $880 billion in cuts, raising concerns about potential impacts on low-income programs. As House Republicans advance this budget, they face the daunting task of unifying their party around a cohesive legislative strategy.
