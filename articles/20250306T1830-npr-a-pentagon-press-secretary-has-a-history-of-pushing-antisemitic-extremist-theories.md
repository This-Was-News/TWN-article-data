## Article summary
The article discusses the controversy surrounding Kingsley Wilson, the new Deputy Press Secretary at the Pentagon, who has faced criticism for her past comments deemed antisemitic and extremist. Members of Congress and civil rights organizations have condemned Wilson for her online posts and commentary during her time at the Center for Renewing America, where she promoted antisemitic theories and criticized U.S. support for Ukraine. Notably, Wilson made inflammatory remarks about Leo Frank, a Jewish man lynched in 1915, echoing neo-Nazi narratives. Critics argue that her hiring represents a troubling trend of extremists gaining roles in the federal government. Wilson has also expressed support for political violence and made derogatory remarks about various political figures, including calling for the deportation of Senator Lindsey Graham. Her comments align with white nationalist ideologies, including the "great replacement theory" and a belief in "blood and soil." The Department of Defense has not commented on the backlash. Overall, Wilson's history raises significant concerns about her suitability for her position in the Pentagon.
