## Article summary
Trump’s new tariffs pose significant challenges for Apple, as they face proposed tariffs of 46% on Vietnam and 26% on India, alongside existing 20% tariffs on Chinese imports. Apple's strategy to diversify production to these countries since 2018 may backfire, especially with Trump's intention to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 34%. The tariffs threaten to increase Apple's annual costs by $8.5 billion, potentially reducing profits by 7% next year. This could lead to higher prices for consumers or reduced profits for the company, which relies heavily on iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches for revenue. 

Despite past efforts to build a relationship with Trump and avoid tariffs, Apple has not shifted major production back to the U.S. and continues to face challenges in establishing a robust manufacturing presence in India and Vietnam. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has expressed concerns over the U.S. workforce's ability to meet manufacturing demands compared to China. The company's stock fell 5.7% following the announcement of the new tariffs, reflecting investor concerns over the financial impact. Overall, the tariffs not only affect Apple but could also have ripple effects on other tech companies reliant on international supply chains.
