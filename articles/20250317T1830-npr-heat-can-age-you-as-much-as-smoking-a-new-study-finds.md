## Article summary
A recent study published in *Science Advances* reveals that prolonged exposure to heat can accelerate biological aging, comparable to the effects of smoking and drinking. Researchers found that individuals over 56 years old living in extremely hot areas, such as Phoenix, exhibit biological signs of aging that make them appear approximately 14 months older than their counterparts in cooler regions like Seattle. The study indicates that heat exposure alters DNA behavior, potentially leading to serious long-term health issues, including dementia, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

The researchers tracked changes in DNA methylation, which serves as a molecular clock for aging, and assessed the heat exposure of over 3,600 older adults. Results showed that those with long-term heat exposure aged faster biologically, regardless of other factors like education and smoking habits. The study highlights the growing health risks associated with climate change, as increasing heat days may exacerbate these effects, particularly on older populations who are less adept at managing heat. Experts emphasize the need for personalized assessments of heat exposure in homes to better understand its health impacts and explore preventive measures.
