## Article summary
Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), has significantly influenced U.S. immigration policy, particularly during President Trump's administration. Supporters view him as a visionary for promoting strict immigration reforms, while critics label him an extremist, linking him to nativist and anti-immigrant sentiments. Stein argues that illegal immigration burdens taxpayers and advocates for policies like ending birthright citizenship, which he claims contributes to issues like birth tourism. His ideas, once considered fringe, have gained traction and are now debated at the highest levels, including the U.S. Supreme Court. Stein's leadership has allowed FAIR to gain prominence, with former staff now holding influential positions within the government. Despite being criticized for inflammatory rhetoric, Stein believes that backlash is inherent in challenging the status quo. He supports reducing humanitarian protections and emphasizes the need for immigrants to contribute to the U.S. economy. Stein's views are rooted in a long history of advocacy that aligns with controversial figures and ideologies, including ties to white nationalism. As he steps back from active leadership, he remains engaged in immigration debates and supports ongoing restrictive measures.
