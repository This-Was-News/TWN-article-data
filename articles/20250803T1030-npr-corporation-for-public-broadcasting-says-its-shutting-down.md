## Article summary
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) announced it will shut down by September 30, 2025, following the loss of all federal funding. This decision comes after President Trump signed a law cutting $1.1 billion in funding for public broadcasting through 2027, part of a broader $9 billion rescissions package. CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison stated that despite public efforts to preserve funding, the organization must close, emphasizing its commitment to a transparent transition. The closure will eliminate most staff positions by the end of the fiscal year, with a small team remaining until January to handle financial obligations. Public media stations, particularly those in rural and underserved areas, will be significantly impacted, with some already experiencing layoffs and others seeing increased donations.
