## Article summary
Sean Murphy, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney, resigned from the Department of Justice, expressing deep concerns over its independence and direction under the Trump administration. In his resignation letter, he criticized the erosion of the Justice Department's autonomy, stating, "you serve no man," and emphasized the need for prosecutors to serve the public rather than political figures. Murphy, who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6 Capitol attack, felt increasingly threatened by both the administration's stance and harassment from defendants emboldened by presidential pardons. 

He noted a troubling shift in the Justice Department's priorities, particularly under Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump loyalist, which he believed undermined the credibility of federal law enforcement. Murphy's decision was also influenced by personal considerations for his family's stability, leading him to accept a private practice position in Puerto Rico. His resignation followed a trend, with several prosecutors leaving the DOJ amid ethical concerns regarding political interference. 

In his letter, he praised his fellow prosecutors' work on January 6 cases and mocked a recent DOJ memo banning paper straws, highlighting the absurdity of such directives amid serious legal matters. Ultimately, Murphy's resignation reflects broader anxieties about the politicization of justice in the current administration.
