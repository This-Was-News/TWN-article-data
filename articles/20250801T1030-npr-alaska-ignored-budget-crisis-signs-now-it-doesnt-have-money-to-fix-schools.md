## Article summary
The web page discusses Alaska's budget crisis and its impact on rural schools, highlighting the state's failure to address funding requests for school repairs and maintenance. Despite promises from lawmakers, only a fraction of the needed funds was allocated, and Governor Mike Dunleavy vetoed a significant portion of it. The crisis stems from Alaska's reliance on oil revenue, which has declined, leaving the state without sufficient funds to meet its obligations. Rural schools, which cannot levy local taxes, are particularly affected, facing serious health and safety risks due to deteriorating buildings. Lawmakers have considered various solutions, including taxes and infrastructure projects, but have yet to implement a long-term fix.
