## Article summary
The United States has imposed a 25 percent tariff on imported auto parts, which is expected to significantly increase prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. This move, initiated by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follows previous tariffs on imported cars. The tariffs do not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico if they meet North American trade agreement requirements. While the administration claims the tariffs will bolster national security and reduce reliance on foreign imports, they are likely to contribute to overall inflation and raise car prices by thousands of dollars. The auto industry is already feeling the effects, with increased demand for used cars and rising repair costs due to pricier replacement parts. Automakers face uncertainty regarding trade policies, which complicates their ability to invest in domestic production. General Motors, in particular, is expected to be hit hard due to its reliance on imported parts. The tariffs could also lead to job losses in Canada, as seen with GM's decision to cut shifts at its Oshawa plant. Despite some companies delaying price increases due to existing inventories, the long-term outlook remains bleak as they cannot absorb the tariff costs indefinitely.
