## Article summary
Anthony Broadwater was wrongfully convicted in 1982 of raping Alice Sebold, serving nearly 17 years in prison before his exoneration in 2021. After his release, he struggled to rebuild his life, facing stigma and employment challenges. Timothy Mucciante, a disbarred lawyer, offered to produce a documentary to prove Broadwater's innocence, leading to a contract that ultimately limited Broadwater's rights to his own story. Despite initial hope, the film was never made, and Mucciante's integrity came into question as he failed to pay for production and misled Broadwater about potential DNA evidence. Broadwater eventually severed ties with Mucciante and pursued legal action to nullify the contract, which a judge later canceled. Meanwhile, Sebold publicly apologized for her role in Broadwater’s wrongful conviction. Now, Broadwater is collaborating with a new filmmaker, Alex Gibney, on a documentary that aims to share his story authentically. While still cautious due to past experiences, Broadwater is slowly rebuilding his trust in people and finding joy in personal connections.
