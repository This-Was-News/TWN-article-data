## Article summary
A federal judge has ordered the Trump White House to grant the Associated Press (AP) access to the Oval Office and other areas, stating it is unlawful to deny access based on the AP's terminology preferences. The ruling came after the AP refused to use President Trump's preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico, which he called the Gulf of America. The judge emphasized that the First Amendment protects journalists' rights to report freely and that the government cannot selectively bar access based on differing viewpoints. Despite the ruling, AP journalists faced continued exclusion from White House events shortly after the decision.

The judge noted that the AP has historically been part of the White House reporting pool and that the administration's actions had caused significant harm to the news service. The White House had previously argued that access to events is a privilege controlled by them, while the AP contended that it was being unfairly punished for its editorial choices. The judge highlighted that the AP sought a level playing field rather than special treatment. Following the ruling, an AP spokesperson expressed gratitude, affirming the importance of press freedom. The case reflects broader tensions between the Trump administration and the media, with implications for journalistic independence.
