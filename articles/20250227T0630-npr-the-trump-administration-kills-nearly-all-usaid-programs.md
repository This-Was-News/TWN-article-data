## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced the termination of nearly all USAID programs, effectively dismantling the agency's six-decade legacy. This decision came as the administration faced a federal court deadline to resume payments on foreign assistance grants, with the government owing over $1 billion for previously completed work. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's review led to the elimination of about 92% of USAID's grants, totaling around 4,100 contracts, which the administration claims will save nearly $60 billion. Humanitarian officials have described the cuts as a "global health massacre," warning that the loss of funding will significantly impact life-saving programs, including those providing HIV medications. 

Aid groups have raised alarms about the potential loss of life in crisis zones, particularly in places like Sudan, where food aid programs have already closed. While the State Department stated the cuts were part of a review to ensure taxpayer dollars were effectively utilized, critics argue that these decisions threaten global health and humanitarian efforts. Only 500 grants were retained, but details on which programs will continue remain unclear. The situation has provoked outrage among humanitarian organizations and advocates, who worry about the devastating consequences of these funding cuts.
