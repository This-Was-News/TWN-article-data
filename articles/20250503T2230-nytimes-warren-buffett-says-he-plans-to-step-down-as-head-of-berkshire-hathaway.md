## Article summary
Warren Buffett, the long-time CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, plans to step down by the end of 2025, appointing Gregory Abel as his successor. Buffett, 94, announced this decision at the company's annual shareholder meeting, expressing confidence in Abel's ability to lead the conglomerate, which has a market value of $1.1 trillion. While Buffett will relinquish his CEO role, he will remain as chairman and the company's largest shareholder, maintaining a significant influence. The announcement received a warm reception from shareholders, highlighting the anticipated leadership transition. 

Despite Buffett's good health, the meeting reflected his advancing age, as he used a cane and shortened the Q&A session. Berkshire Hathaway's recent financial performance showed a decline in earnings, attributed to market volatility and investment losses, but Buffett remains optimistic about the company's resilience. He emphasized the importance of long-term investing and expressed concerns over trade policies impacting operations. Abel, currently vice chairman of non-insurance businesses, is expected to uphold Berkshire's culture and values. The transition marks a significant moment in corporate America, concluding an era defined by Buffett's investment acumen and leadership.
