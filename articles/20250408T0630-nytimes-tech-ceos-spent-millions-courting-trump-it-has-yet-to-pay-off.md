## Article summary
Tech CEOs have invested millions in courting President Trump, including donations to his inauguration and hosting events in his honor. However, Trump's administration has not reciprocated these gestures, imposing tariffs that negatively impact major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google. These tariffs, alongside cuts to federal funding for emerging technology research and a strict immigration policy, have alarmed the tech industry. The administration's aggressive regulatory approach, including an antitrust trial against Meta, further complicates the relationship. Despite previous hostility towards Trump, tech leaders have shifted their tone, seeking engagement to influence policy. Notably, figures like Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai have made recent visits to the White House. However, industry experts suggest that the relationship remains largely one-sided, with tech executives giving without receiving much in return. While some policies may favor tech, such as a lighter regulatory touch on AI, the overall climate is becoming increasingly challenging for these companies. The recent tariffs on imports from China, particularly affecting Apple, are expected to raise consumer prices and provoke retaliation from trade partners.
