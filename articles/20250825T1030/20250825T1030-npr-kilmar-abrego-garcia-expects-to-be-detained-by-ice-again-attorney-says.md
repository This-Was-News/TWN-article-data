## Article summary
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man previously wrongfully deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., is expected to be detained by ICE again on Monday. His attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, expressed concerns about the necessity of detention, as Garcia is already being monitored electronically. ICE plans to deport Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a plea deal to be deported to Costa Rica. Garcia's attorneys believe this move is intended to pressure him into a guilty plea, using Uganda as a punitive measure. They also suspect that Uganda may ultimately deport Garcia back to El Salvador, which they argue would be illegal. Garcia was born in El Salvador but had been living in Maryland. Despite his brief reunion with family and friends over the weekend, his attorney fears this reprieve may be short-lived. ICE has not responded to requests for comment on the situation.
