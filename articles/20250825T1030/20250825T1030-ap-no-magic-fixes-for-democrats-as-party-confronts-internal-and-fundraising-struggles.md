## Article summary
Ken Martin, the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), is leading the party's resistance against President Donald Trump while addressing internal divisions and fundraising challenges. Martin emphasizes the need for unity and action within the party, noting that the greatest divide is between those actively fighting and those on the sidelines. Despite tough rhetoric, there is frustration among Democrats that the party is not effectively countering Republican policies. Big donors are unhappy, and the party's message is unclear, leading to a decline in support among key voter groups. The DNC's financial situation is weak compared to the Republican National Committee, with only $14 million in cash reserves. Martin acknowledges donor fatigue but highlights investments in state parties and the response from smaller-dollar donors. The DNC is also grappling with internal divisions over resolutions related to the Israel-Hamas war, with competing proposals addressing military aid and the recognition of Palestine. Martin stresses the need to focus on economic issues to resonate with voters. The DNC is also beginning discussions on the 2028 presidential primary calendar, with potential changes from the 2024 schedule. The party aims to ensure an open process for states to bid for early voting slots.
