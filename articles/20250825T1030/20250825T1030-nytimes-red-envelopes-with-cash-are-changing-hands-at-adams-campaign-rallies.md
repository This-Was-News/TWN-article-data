## Article summary
New York Times reporters witnessed supporters of Mayor Eric Adams handing out cash-filled red envelopes at campaign rallies, sometimes to reporters from Chinese-language outlets. This practice, common in Chinese culture, was observed at three separate events in Flushing, Manhattan's Chinatown, and Sunset Park. Adams' advisor, Winnie Greco, was involved in an incident where she attempted to pay a reporter from The City with a red envelope stuffed with cash. The Adams campaign denied knowledge or approval of these payments, stating that such behavior is inappropriate. Community leaders, including Steven Tn and Robin Mu, organized these events and distributed the envelopes as a form of appreciation or to cover expenses. The practice is common among Chinese-language journalists in New York, though established American news organizations prohibit such payments. The Adams campaign suspended Greco after the incident, and federal prosecutors seized the cash and envelope involved. The campaign emphasized that they do not authorize or endorse such payments. The incidents highlight the close ties between Adams and the Chinese-American community, as well as the ongoing investigations and scandals surrounding his administration.
