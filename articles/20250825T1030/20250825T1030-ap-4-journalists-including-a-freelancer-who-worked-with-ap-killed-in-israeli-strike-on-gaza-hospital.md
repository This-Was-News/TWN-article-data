## Article summary
An Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza killed four journalists, including an Associated Press freelancer named Maram Dagga, according to health officials. Dagga, a visual journalist, had been freelancing for the AP and other outlets since the Gaza war began. The strike also claimed the lives of Al Jazeera journalist Mohammed Salam and Reuters contractor cameraman Hussam al-Masr, while wounding Reuters contractor photographer Hatem Khaled. The attack resulted in a total of 19 deaths. The Israel-Hamas war has been particularly deadly for media workers, with at least 192 journalists killed in Gaza over the past 22 months. Israel has largely barred international media from covering the war, relying instead on Palestinian journalists and residents to report from the region. Many of these journalists face the same struggles as the people they cover, including difficulties in finding food for themselves and their families.
