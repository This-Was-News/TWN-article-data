Legal advocates and volunteers report a surge in arrests and a deterioration of due process. The courts are struggling with a massive backlog, with many hearings scheduled for 2029. The article also highlights the conflicting security protocols and the tense interactions between court observers, journalists, and federal agents. The overall atmosphere is one of confusion, anger, and uncertainty for immigrants navigating the system.
