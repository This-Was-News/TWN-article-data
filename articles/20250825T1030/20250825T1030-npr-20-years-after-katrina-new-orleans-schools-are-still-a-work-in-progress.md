## Article summary
Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' public school system has undergone a dramatic transformation, becoming nearly all-charter. The shift began after the storm when state officials took over most schools and converted them into charter schools, aiming to improve a struggling system. Initially, there were challenges, including uncertified teachers and a lack of resources like art and sports programs. However, over time, the system improved, with higher test scores, graduation rates, and college attendance. The city's school board now closes underperforming schools, which has driven progress but also caused pain for families affected by closures. The system is still evolving, with debates about whether to return to some traditional public schools. Despite mixed opinions, many acknowledge the improvements and the ongoing efforts to refine the system. The city's schools remain a work in progress, guided by a willingness to adapt and improve.
