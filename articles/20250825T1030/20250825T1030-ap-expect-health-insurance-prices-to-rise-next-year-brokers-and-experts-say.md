## Article summary
Health insurance prices are expected to rise in 2026 due to increasing medical costs and prescription drug prices, particularly for expensive diabetes and obesity treatments like Ozempic, Mounjaro, Wegovy, and Zepbound. Insurers are facing higher costs from more people seeking care, increased emergency room visits, and mental health treatment claims. The individual coverage marketplaces may see the most significant price hikes, with insurers predicting a 20% increase in premiums. Additionally, the potential expiration of enhanced tax credits could lead to a 75% or more increase in coverage costs for consumers. Employers are also feeling the pressure, with some likely to shift more costs to employees, such as higher deductibles or separate deductibles for pharmaceutical benefits. Coverage changes may vary across the country, but employers are reluctant to cut benefits, which could delay more drastic changes. Overall, the healthcare market is experiencing a period of uncertainty not seen in a long time.
