## Article summary
The article explores how Chinese-backed social clubs in New York City have influenced local elections by undermining politicians who challenge China's regime or support Taiwan. These organizations, many of which are tax-exempt nonprofits, have targeted candidates who oppose China's authoritarian government, helping to unseat some and endorse others. The groups, often hometown associations, have become tools of China's consulate in Manhattan, intimidating politicians who support Taiwan or cross Beijing's red lines. China's influence extends beyond New York, with similar efforts in other countries. The article highlights specific cases, including the targeting of a congressional candidate and a state senator, and discusses the broader implications of China's political interference. Despite denials from the Chinese consulate, evidence suggests a coordinated effort to shape political outcomes in New York City.
