## Article summary
Bryan Kohberger exhibited sexist and creepy behavior while attending a criminal justice program at Washington State University before the 2022 Idaho murders. His conduct was so concerning that a faculty member warned colleagues he might stalk or sexually abuse future students if he became a professor. Investigators interviewed students and instructors, revealing that Kohberger would block doors to offices where female grad students worked and was suspected of stalking. A Ph.D. student in his program described him as enjoying conflict and being disparaging toward women. After the murders, Kohberger commented that the killer must have been skilled and speculated it might be a one-time event. The school received multiple complaints about his behavior, leading to a mandatory training class on expectations. Some noticed changes in his behavior post-murders, including not bringing his phone to class and appearing disheveled. One student reported seeing him with bloody knuckles before the killings.
