## Article summary
The national tour of *Parade*, a Tony Award-winning musical about the 1915 lynching of Jewish man Leo Frank, concludes at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., amidst a rise in antisemitic hate and President Trump's transformation of the institution. The musical dramatizes the murder of Mary Phagan and the trial of Leo Frank, who was widely believed to have been falsely accused. The case, which remains controversial, has sparked interest from far-right groups, including neo-Nazis and right-wing influencers, such as Kngsley Wilson, now a Trump administration official. Despite the controversy, composer Jason Robert Brown emphasizes the importance of performing *Parade* at the Kennedy Center, calling it 'America's stage' and highlighting the show's relevance in addressing hatred in America. The musical's story, based on a true crime spectacle, explores themes of antisemitism, racism, and mob violence. Playwright Alfred Uhry, who grew up in Atlanta, was inspired to write *Parade* after learning about the Frank case. The 2023 Broadway revival of *Parade* gained significant attention, coinciding with a resurgence of antisemitic hate. The musical's narrative continues to resonate, drawing parallels between historical and contemporary issues of bigotry and injustice.
