## Article summary
Hurricane Erin is forecast to send massive waves to North Carolina's Outer Banks, threatening to isolate Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands. Officials have ordered evacuations due to the vulnerability of the only connecting highway, N.C. 12, which is likely to be damaged. The islands, formed from ancient sand dunes, are particularly susceptible to erosion and storm damage. The Outer Banks, known for their tourism and unique lifestyle, face constant battles with nature. Storms can wash out roads and create new inlets, requiring significant repairs. The region's low elevation and rising sea levels further exacerbate the risks. Despite these challenges, residents and visitors are drawn to the area's natural beauty and sense of community. The economic impact of tourism drives the cycle of repair and maintenance. The isolation caused by storms often strengthens community bonds among residents.
