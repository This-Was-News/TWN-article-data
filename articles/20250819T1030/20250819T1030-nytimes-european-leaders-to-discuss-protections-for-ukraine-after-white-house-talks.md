## Article summary
European leaders met via videoconference to discuss protections for Ukraine following a meeting with President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House. The meeting showcased solidarity with Kyiv but yielded few details on ending the war with Russia. Key discussions focused on security guarantees for Ukraine, with leaders from Britain, France, and Germany participating. Despite warm interactions, tangible progress toward ending the war remained unclear. Russia launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight, causing injuries and damage. Zelensky highlighted progress on U.S. security guarantees but left without a formal agreement. Trump pushed for a trilateral meeting with Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, though the Kremlin showed no sign of accepting. European leaders emphasized the importance of a cease-fire, while Trump suggested a peace deal could be reached without one. The discussions also included plans for Ukraine to purchase $90 billion in American weapons and for the U.S. to buy Ukrainian drones. The meeting aimed to prevent a peace agreement based solely on Russian demands, with European leaders ensuring their concerns were addressed.
