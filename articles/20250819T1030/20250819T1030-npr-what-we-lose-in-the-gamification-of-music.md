## Article summary
The article discusses the cultural impact of Taylor Swift's music releases, highlighting the exhaustion non-Swift fans feel due to her frequent rollouts and the gamification of her music. Swift's prolific output, including re-recordings and new albums, is compared to the Beatles' productivity, noting the demands on both artists and critics. The piece explores how Swift's dominance in popular culture equates popularity with cultural significance, challenging traditional distinctions between high and low art. The gamification of music, where fans engage in egg hunts and solve puzzles, is critiqued for shifting the focus from appreciating the art itself to playing a game. While Swift's music enriches many fans, the article laments the loss of open-ended art appreciation in favor of fixed, game-like interactions. Despite this, Swift is acknowledged as a dedicated artist, though her method of amplifying her efforts blurs the lines between work and personal life.
