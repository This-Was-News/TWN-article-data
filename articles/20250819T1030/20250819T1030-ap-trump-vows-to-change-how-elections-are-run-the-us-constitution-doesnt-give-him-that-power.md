## Article summary
President Donald Trump has vowed to change how elections are conducted in the U.S., but the Constitution limits his power to do so independently. Trump, relying on false information and conspiracy theories, has promised to eliminate mail voting and voting machines, systems that helped him win the 2024 election and Republicans gain control of Congress. His recent social media post escalates his election rhetoric and includes false claims about mail voting being unique to the U.S., despite its use in many other countries. Trump's actions, including an executive order requiring proof of citizenship to vote, have faced legal challenges. He also discussed election issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump's efforts to influence elections, such as directing investigations and redistricting, highlight his intent to favor his party in the 2026 midterms. However, the Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to set federal election rules. Trump's claims about election fraud and voting machines are widely debunked, and his executive orders have been blocked by courts. Despite Republican control of Congress, significant changes to election rules are unlikely due to Democratic opposition and practical challenges.
