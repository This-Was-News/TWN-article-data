## Article summary
The web page discusses the uncertain trust between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump, which is crucial for Ukraine's future. Trump provided vague assurances about U.S. involvement in ensuring Ukraine's safety if Zelensky negotiates with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and European leaders ended with optimistic assessments and progress toward a potential Zelensky-Putin meeting, but doubts remain about Trump's reliability due to his history of changing positions. Zelensky seeks concrete security guarantees, including a $90 billion weapons deal and U.S. purchase of Ukrainian drones. Trump's stance has shifted from leaving Ukraine's protection to Europe to offering security guarantees. His recent flip-flops include threatening Putin with consequences for not agreeing to a cease-fire, then adopting Putin's preference for a sweeping peace agreement without an immediate cease-fire. European leaders praised Trump's efforts to facilitate negotiations, but details remain unclear. Analysts suggest that Zelensky needs more than verbal assurances, given Trump's inconsistent history on various international issues, including Ukraine, Gaza, and tariffs. Trump admitted that ending the Ukraine war is more challenging than he initially thought.
