## Article summary
During a meeting in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump expressed U.S. willingness to support European efforts to police a potential peace deal in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude and wore dressier clothes compared to his previous visit. Trump also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin might accept security guarantees for Ukraine, a notion applauded by European leaders. European leaders praised Trump but acknowledged that tough work remains ahead. The meeting was a stark contrast to Zelenskyy's previous visit, where he was criticized for his attire and lack of gratitude. Trump also mentioned arranging a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, though details remain unclear. Despite progress, key issues such as territorial concessions and security guarantees are still unresolved. European leaders support the idea of a trilateral meeting involving Trump, Zelenskyy, and Putin to advance peace efforts.
