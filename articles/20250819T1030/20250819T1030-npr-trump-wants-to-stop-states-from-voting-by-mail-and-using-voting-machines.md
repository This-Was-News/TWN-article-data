## Article summary
President Trump announced plans to eliminate mail-in ballots and certain voting machines ahead of the 2024 midterm elections, citing baseless claims of inaccuracy and corruption. He intends to sign an executive order to bar states from using mail-in ballots and some voting machines, despite legal experts stating he lacks the authority to regulate federal elections. The Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the power to oversee elections. Any changes would require congressional action, which is unlikely. Legal and logistical challenges, including potential litigation and the need for states to pass new laws, make Trump's plan impractical. Experts argue that the effort aims to destabilize the elections and undermine public confidence. Trump has previously attempted to interfere in elections, such as challenging the 2020 election results. The focus now is on ensuring the integrity and fairness of the 2024 elections.
