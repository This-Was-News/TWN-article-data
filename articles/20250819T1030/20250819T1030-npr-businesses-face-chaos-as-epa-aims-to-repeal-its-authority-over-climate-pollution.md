## Article summary
The Trump administration is seeking to repeal the EPA's landmark finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, which has been the basis for federal climate regulations since 2009. This move could lead to the repeal of all federal greenhouse gas standards, creating uncertainty for businesses. While some companies have complained about climate regulations, many prefer federal oversight to avoid lawsuits and ensure a predictable environment for investments. Environmental advocates and experts argue that the administration's proposal contradicts scientific consensus on climate change. The EPA's plan could expose fossil fuel companies to more legal risks and create chaos for businesses, according to trade groups. The Supreme Court's stance on the issue remains uncertain, with some believing it may overturn previous rulings. The EPA's decision highlights a growing divide between the business and ideological wings of the Republican Party.
