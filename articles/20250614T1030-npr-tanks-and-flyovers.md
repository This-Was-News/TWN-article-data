## Article summary
The U.S. Army is set to celebrate its 250th anniversary on June 14, 2025, with a large military parade in Washington, D.C., coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. This event, which includes thousands of service members and heavy military equipment, has raised concerns about the politicization of the armed forces, especially since such parades are rare during peacetime. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the parade a vanity project and a misuse of funds, arguing it reflects authoritarian tendencies. Trump has long sought a military parade since witnessing one in France in 2017, and this occasion has allowed him to realize that vision. 

The parade will feature various military vehicles, aircraft, and historical reenactments, with an expected budget of $25 million to $45 million. Preparations have led to significant street closures and safety measures in the city, raising concerns about potential damage to infrastructure. While the event is intended to celebrate military history, historians note that such displays can send mixed messages about state power and authority in a democracy. Protests against the parade are planned in over 1,800 cities, with organizers aiming to shift attention away from the spectacle. Trump has warned that protests will be met with a strong response from law enforcement. Overall, the parade is poised to be a significant and controversial event in American history.
