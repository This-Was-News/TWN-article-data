## Article summary
President Trump is pressuring major companies like Walmart and Mattel to absorb the costs of tariffs rather than pass them on to consumers, amidst a growing trade war. The U.S. has implemented a 10 percent tariff on many imports, particularly from China, leading to financial strain for businesses that warn of potential price increases. Despite these warnings, the White House insists that foreign countries bear the cost of tariffs, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt stating that it’s a legal obligation for companies to inform investors of financial risks. Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon indicated the retailer may struggle to maintain low prices due to tariffs, prompting Trump to demand they "EAT THE TARIFFS." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that Walmart had previously managed to avoid price hikes during Trump's first term. The administration's aggressive trade strategy has led to concerns about its long-term impact on the U.S. economy, with financial markets reacting negatively. While consumer prices remain steady for now, there are fears that elevated import costs could eventually lead to price increases, particularly in the retail sector. Trump's approach to controlling prices marks a significant departure from his previous campaign rhetoric against price gouging. He has also dismissed concerns from companies like Ford and Mattel regarding the financial implications of tariffs, asserting that consumers will not bear the cost.
