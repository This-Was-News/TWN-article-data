## Article summary
The New York Times reports that less than half of the 59 hostages held in Gaza are believed to be alive, according to the Israeli government. This situation follows a resumption of heavy Israeli airstrikes after Hamas rejected recent proposals for the release of captives. Since the October 7, 2023 attacks, over 130 hostages have been freed, while the bodies of at least 40 others have been recovered by the Israeli military. In January, a multi-stage truce was agreed upon, allowing for exchanges of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, but the cease-fire's status is now uncertain. The first phase saw Hamas release 30 hostages and hand over eight bodies in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, Israel's renewed military actions have raised concerns about the remaining hostages' safety. Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the cease-fire, which could jeopardize the captives' well-being. The situation remains tense, with international attention focused on the fate of the hostages. President Trump has also warned Hamas to release the remaining captives or face severe consequences. The unfolding events underscore the complexities of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.
