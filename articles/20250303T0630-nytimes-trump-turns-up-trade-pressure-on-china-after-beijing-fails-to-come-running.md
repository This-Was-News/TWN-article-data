## Article summary
The article discusses President Trump's escalating trade pressure on China following the country's lack of significant response to his demands regarding drug trafficking and immigration issues. While Canada and Mexico quickly took action to address Trump's concerns, China has been more hesitant, prompting Trump to impose a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports and announce an additional 10 percent increase on existing tariffs. The Chinese government is cautiously assessing Trump's intentions and has not initiated direct talks, fearing that any overtures may appear as pleading. 

Chinese officials are exploring potential trade deal ideas while expressing a desire for equal partnership and criticizing previous U.S. measures to contain China. Despite the tension, there is an indication that China is open to negotiating a deal that could involve significant purchases of American goods and increased investment in the U.S. However, they seek clarity on conditions and are wary of Trump's tariff threats, which could hinder negotiations. 

The article highlights ongoing discussions among Chinese diplomats and think tank representatives in Washington, as they seek reliable communication channels with the Trump administration. While Trump has expressed interest in a comprehensive deal, he remains firm on using tariffs as leverage. The situation reflects a complex and cautious dynamic in U.S.-China relations as both sides navigate their positions amidst economic pressures.
