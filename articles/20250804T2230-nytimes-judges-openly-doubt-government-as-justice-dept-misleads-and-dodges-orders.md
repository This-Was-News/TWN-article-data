## Article summary
Judges are increasingly doubting the honesty and credibility of Justice Department lawyers, a shift from the traditional presumption of regularity. This loss of trust is due to the department's misinformation, violation of court orders, and attacks on judges under President Trump's administration. Judges have openly questioned the department's actions, with some stating that trust has been lost in weeks, not generations. The department has been criticized for dismissing cases against political figures and gang leaders without clear explanations, leading judges to demand more transparency. Legal experts warn that this erosion of trust could have systemic effects, making it harder for the government to function in court and potentially grinding the justice system to a halt.
