## Article summary
Sae Joon Park, a 55-year-old U.S. Army veteran, self-deported to South Korea after nearly 50 years in the U.S. due to a deportation order stemming from past drug possession charges and failure to appear in court. His struggles with untreated PTSD led to substance abuse, complicating his legal status. Park, who was honorably discharged and awarded a Purple Heart after being shot during the 1989 invasion of Panama, faced challenges in obtaining U.S. citizenship because his service did not meet the required duration for expedited naturalization. Recently, immigration authorities warned him of imminent detention unless he left voluntarily, prompting his departure. In his final days in the U.S., he cherished moments with family, including his 85-year-old mother and his children. Park expressed disbelief at his situation, stating, "I can't believe that this is happening in America," despite his military service. He reflected on his experiences, affirming that he does not regret his service, as it shaped who he is today. His story highlights the difficulties faced by noncitizen veterans within the legal system, particularly under stricter immigration policies.
