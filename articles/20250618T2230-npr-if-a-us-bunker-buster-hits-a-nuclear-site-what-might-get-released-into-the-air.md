## Article summary
The potential impact of a U.S. "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant raises concerns about environmental contamination. Experts indicate that if such a bomb were to hit the site, located in a mountainside, the risk of widespread contamination would be minimal. The facility primarily processes uranium hexafluoride, a heavy gas that is unlikely to disperse far from the site. Health physics expert Emily Caffrey suggests that any contamination would likely remain localized, posing little threat to those outside the immediate area. 

Edwin Lyman from the Union of Concerned Scientists notes that the uranium isotopes present are not highly hazardous, meaning the health risks from a potential release would be relatively low. However, there is a concern about uranium hexafluoride reacting with water to form hydrofluoric acid, which is hazardous. The underground nature of the site would mitigate environmental release due to the mass of rock from the explosion. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, reports that previous attacks on Iranian facilities have shown no significant radiological impact on surrounding populations. While there may be internal contamination, it can be managed with protective measures. Overall, the anticipated environmental effects of an attack would likely be limited and manageable.
