## Article summary
Iran has launched a series of retaliatory missile strikes toward Israel following significant Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, which resulted in the deaths of top Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists. The Israeli strikes were part of an operation aimed at neutralizing the threat posed by Iran's nuclear ambitions, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stating that the operation was planned for months and would continue until the threat is eliminated. The attacks come in the wake of the U.N. nuclear watchdog's declaration that Iran was not complying with nuclear non-proliferation agreements. 

In response, air raid sirens were activated across Israel, prompting citizens to stock up on supplies and leading to the cancellation of public events. Jordan also experienced air raid warnings and intercepted missiles heading toward its territory. Former President Trump urged Iran to reach a nuclear deal before facing severe consequences, while U.S. officials emphasized that America was not involved in the Israeli strikes but remained focused on protecting U.S. interests in the region. 

The situation has escalated tensions in the Middle East, with airspace closures and increased military readiness among neighboring countries. The International Atomic Energy Agency is monitoring the situation, particularly the radiation levels at the damaged Natanz facility.
