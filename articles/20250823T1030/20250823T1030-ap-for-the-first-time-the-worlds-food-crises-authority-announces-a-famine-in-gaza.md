## Article summary
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has announced the first confirmed famine in the Middle East, specifically in Gaza City, with projections that it will spread to other areas like Der al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of the next month. The famine is attributed to Israel's restrictions on food and humanitarian aid, as well as its military offensive, which have led to severe starvation, particularly among children. Israel has rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an outright lie. The IPC's declaration is expected to increase international pressure on Israel, which has been fighting Hamas since the militant group's October 7, 2023, attack. The IPC reports that over half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of the population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres described the findings as a human-made disaster and a moral indictment, appealing for an immediate ceasefire. Israel disputes the report, with Netanyahu denying there is hunger in Gaza and blaming Hamas for promoting lies about starvation. The U.S. State Department also cast doubt on the report, blaming Hamas and looters for the difficulties in delivering aid. Despite Israel's recent measures to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, the United Nations states that the amount entering is far below what is needed. Experts argue that the tightening of the blockade from early March to mid-May, during which Israel barred the import of all food, medicine, and other goods, has severely exacerbated the humanitarian crisis.
