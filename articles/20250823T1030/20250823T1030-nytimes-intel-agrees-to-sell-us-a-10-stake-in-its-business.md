## Article summary
Intel has agreed to sell the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business, worth $8.9 billion, marking one of the largest government interventions in a U.S. company since the 2008 financial crisis. President Trump announced the deal, which came after negotiations with Intel's CEO, Lp-Bu Tan. The U.S. will invest $8.9 billion in Intel's stock, in addition to $2.2 billion already provided under the CHIPS and Science Act. The government will not take a board seat or have governance rights. Intel's CEO expressed gratitude for the confidence placed in the company. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnck called the agreement historic, aiming to strengthen U.S. leadership in semiconductors. The deal is notable as the most significant government intervention since the 2008 auto industry rescue. Intel has faced challenges, missing several innovation waves, and the deal is part of efforts to revitalize the company. The agreement was finalized quickly, with Intel's board approving it. The deal could face legal challenges, and the Trump administration has taken an interventionist approach with private companies, particularly in the semiconductor industry. Intel's future remains uncertain, despite the government's investment.
