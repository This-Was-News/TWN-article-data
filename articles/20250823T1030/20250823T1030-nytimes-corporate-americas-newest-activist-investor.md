## Article summary
Corporate America is facing a new type of activist investor: President Donald Trump. Unlike traditional investors, Trump has inserted the government into U.S. companies in unprecedented ways, such as taking stakes in U.S. Steel, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. The Pentagon recently took a 15% stake in MP Materials, and Intel agreed to a 10% government stake worth $8.9 billion. These actions resemble state-managed capitalism seen in Europe, China, and Russia, raising concerns among Wall Street bankers and lawyers. The Trump administration is casting a wide net, targeting companies for potential government involvement. While the U.S. government has intervened in corporate America before, experts say Trump's approach is more aggressive and targets healthy companies. The White House justifies these actions as driven by national security, but some see them as extortion. Intel's shareholders reacted positively to the government's involvement, with shares rising over 5%. However, competitors like AMD have seen declines, partly due to expectations of government favoritism. The growing entanglement of the government in private enterprise raises broader questions about shareholder protections and market-driven strategic decisions. Companies are scrambling to avoid government stakes or demands, often by aligning with Trump's agenda and visiting him frequently. Policy experts worry this new business climate is eroding the level playing field crucial for the country's long-term success.
