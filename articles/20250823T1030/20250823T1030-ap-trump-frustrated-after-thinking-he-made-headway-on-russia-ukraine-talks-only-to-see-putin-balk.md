## Article summary
A top European diplomat, Kaja Kallas, warns that Russian President Vladimir Putin is setting a trap by demanding Ukrainian concessions as part of a peace deal. She argues that granting these demands would reward Russia for its aggression. Kallas emphasizes that Russia has not made any concessions despite its attacks on Ukraine. U.S.-led peace efforts have faced challenges, with Russia continuing its assaults and objecting to key Ukrainian demands. Meanwhile, Ukraine has retaliated by targeting Russian infrastructure, including the Druzhba oil pipeline, which supplies Hungary with over half of its crude oil. Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, has taken a confrontational stance towards Ukraine and its EU supporters. Slovakia and Hungary are the only EU members still receiving oil from Russia, as other nations have imposed sanctions. The diplomat asserts that Russia is not genuinely seeking peace, as evidenced by its continued aggression.
