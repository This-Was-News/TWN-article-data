## Article summary
The Justice Department released transcripts and audio recordings of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's conversations with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's longtime partner, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The interviews, conducted in Tallahassee, Florida, cover Maxwell's interactions with various officials, including President Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Maxwell stated she never witnessed Trump in inappropriate settings and did not consider him and Epstein close friends. She also denied any inappropriate activity involving figures like Bill Gates, Chris Tucker, Kevin Spacey, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy. Maxwell's legal team appears to be seeking clemency, and she was recently transferred to a minimum-security prison in Texas. The transcripts were released alongside documents from the Epstein investigation shared with the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make some records public.
