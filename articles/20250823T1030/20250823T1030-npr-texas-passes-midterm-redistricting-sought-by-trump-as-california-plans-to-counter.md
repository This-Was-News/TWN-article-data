## Article summary
The Texas Legislature has approved a new congressional map that could help Republicans gain five more U.S. House seats, aligning with President Trump's call for more Republican-leaning districts. The plan, expected to be signed by Governor Greg Abbott, was defended by Texas State Sen. Phil King, who emphasized its legal compliance and potential to benefit Republican candidates. Democrats oppose the map, arguing it dilutes the voting power of Black and Latino voters and creates disproportionate districts. Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new voting map that could help Democrats gain five additional congressional seats, with a measure to bypass the state's independent redistricting commission. The redistricting efforts in both states highlight a broader competition influenced by Trump, with Democrats and Republicans engaging in heated debates over the fairness and legality of the new maps. Democrats in Texas have threatened legal challenges, while Republicans argue for the legitimacy of the state's redistricting process. The White House has encouraged Republicans in other states to consider similar redistricting measures. The passage of the Texas map follows the return of Democratic legislators who had left the state to block the vote, citing the need to build a legal record against the map in court.
