## Article summary
The Texas Senate approved a new Republican-leaning congressional voting map, sending it to Governor Greg Abbott for signature. The map, supported by President Donald Trump, includes five new districts favoring Republicans and is expected to be signed into law by Abbott. Democrats have vowed to challenge the map in court and attempted to delay its passage through a filibuster, but their efforts were thwarted. The redrawing of the map has sparked a broader national debate on redistricting, with California Democrats also approving a redrawn map for a special election. The Texas redraw has already impacted the 2026 race, with Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett announcing he will not seek re-election if the new map takes effect. Governor Abbott criticized California's redistricting efforts, calling them a joke, while California Governor Gavin Newsom defended his state's actions as a response to Texas's moves. The Supreme Court has ruled that partisan gerrymandering is not unconstitutional, only the use of race to redraw district lines. The redistricting battle highlights the partisan divide and the strategic importance of controlling congressional maps ahead of the midterm elections.
