## Article summary
Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend, denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior by Donald Trump during interviews with the Justice Department. The Trump administration released transcripts of these interviews, aiming to distance the president from Epstein. Maxwell praised Trump and denied seeing him in any inappropriate settings. She recalled knowing Trump since the 1990s and having visited his Mar-a-Lago estate. Maxwell also denied ever hearing allegations of Trump's inappropriate behavior with masseuses. She was interviewed over two days in Florida and moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas. Maxwell also discussed her interactions with Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, denying any inappropriate conduct. She distanced herself from Epstein's actions, acknowledging his preference for younger women but claiming she never considered it criminal. The case has drawn public attention due to Epstein's connections to prominent figures. The Trump administration has faced backlash over its handling of evidence from the Epstein case, with some supporters hoping for proof of a government cover-up.
