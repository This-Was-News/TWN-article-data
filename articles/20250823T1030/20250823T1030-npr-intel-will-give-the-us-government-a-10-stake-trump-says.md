## Article summary
President Trump announced that Intel CEO Lp-Bu Tan agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in Intel during a White House meeting. The government will invest $8.9 billion in Intel common stock, with part of the funding coming from CHIPS and Science Act grants and the Defense Department's Secure Enclave program. The deal, confirmed by Intel, includes the government purchasing 433.3 million shares at $20.47 per share, equating to a 9.9% stake without board representation or governance rights. Trump praised the deal as beneficial for both the U.S. and Intel, marking an unusual step in the administration's efforts to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Intel, facing recent challenges in chip production and revenue declines, plans to invest over $28 billion in Ohio facilities, though demand for these chips remains uncertain. The deal follows Trump's earlier pressure on Intel's CEO and other tech leaders, highlighting the administration's push for greater control over U.S. semiconductor production.
