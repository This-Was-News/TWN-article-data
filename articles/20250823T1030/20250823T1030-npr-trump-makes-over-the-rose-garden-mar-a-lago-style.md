## Article summary
President Donald Trump has renovated the White House Rose Garden, replacing the grass with a stone patio inspired by his Mar-a-Lago club. The $1.9 million project, funded by private donations, includes new drainage systems and presidential seals at the corners. Trump justified the change by noting the grass was too soggy for fine footwear. The Rose Garden, originally designed during the Kennedy administration, has hosted numerous events and press conferences. First Lady Melania Trump previously oversaw a restoration project to revive the garden's original design. Despite criticism, the garden remains vibrant with new roses and plants. The latest renovation includes patio tables and umbrellas, similar to Mar-a-Lago's Beach Club. Trump has also made other changes to the White House, including gilding the Oval Office and planning a new ballroom. Stewart McLaurn of the White House Historical Association noted that the White House evolves over time, with different presidents and first ladies making their mark. The Rose Garden's transformation reflects Trump's vision, blending historical elements with his personal style.
