## Article summary
The Menendez brothers, Erik and Lyle, were denied parole by a California board after hearings that lasted two days. They were questioned about their childhood abuse, their mindset before and after the murders of their parents in 1989, and various prison infractions. Sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for killing their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, the brothers have garnered public support recently due to shows on Netflix. The hearings were their closest chance at freedom since their convictions. Despite receiving three-year denials, they can request an administrative review in one year, potentially appearing before the parole board again in 18 months. Key takeaways from the hearings include the brothers' use of illicit cellphones, which was seen as a serious infraction, and their associations with prison gangs. The commissioners expressed concerns about the killing of Kitty Menendez, questioning the brothers' remorse and actions. The brothers' family members, including an aunt and a great-niece, spoke in their support, advocating for their release. Despite the denial, the family remains hopeful and committed to supporting the brothers.
