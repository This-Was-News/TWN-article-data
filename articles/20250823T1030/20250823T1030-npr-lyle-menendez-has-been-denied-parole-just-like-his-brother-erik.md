## Article summary
Lyle Menendez has been denied parole, following his brother Erik's similar denial. A two-person panel found Lyle unsuitable for release, citing ongoing concerns about his risk to the public. The brothers have been imprisoned for over three decades for the 1989 murders of their parents. Lyle's next parole hearing is set for three years. The parole board noted his remorse but highlighted his struggles with deception and rule-following. The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office opposed parole, arguing the brothers remain a threat. Lyle's attorney emphasized the role of childhood sexual abuse in the crimes. During the hearing, Lyle discussed the abuse he suffered and his complex relationship with his parents. He admitted to past deceptions but claimed to have changed. The board acknowledged his positive actions in prison but ultimately denied parole. Family members pleaded for his release, citing his rehabilitation. The decision is subject to further review, and Governor Gavin Newsom has the authority to intervene.
