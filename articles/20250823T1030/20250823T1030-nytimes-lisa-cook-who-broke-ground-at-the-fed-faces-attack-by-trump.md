## Article summary
Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve board, has faced scrutiny and attacks from former President Donald Trump. She has been a trailblazer in a field dominated by white men, previously writing about her experiences as one of the few Black women in economics. Despite her qualifications, her confirmation process was challenging, with Republicans largely opposing her appointment. She was confirmed narrowly with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote. Trump is now pressuring Cook to resign, with Bill Pulte accusing her of falsifying documents to secure a mortgage. Cook has stated she will not be bullied and plans to address any legitimate questions with accurate information.
