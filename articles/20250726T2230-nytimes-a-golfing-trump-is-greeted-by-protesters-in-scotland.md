## Article summary
President Trump golfed at his Turnberry course in Scotland, while hundreds of protesters demonstrated against his policies on immigration, the Gaza war, and other issues. In Edinburgh, a protester played the bagpipes while holding an anti-Trump sign. Trump played golf with his son Eric, his UK ambassador Warren A. Stephens, and the ambassador's son. Upon arrival, Trump was greeted by supporters at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, where he praised Turnberry as the best golf course in the world. He also delivered a message to European leaders, urging them to halt mass migration and abandon wind power, which he claimed was destroying the continent's beauty.
