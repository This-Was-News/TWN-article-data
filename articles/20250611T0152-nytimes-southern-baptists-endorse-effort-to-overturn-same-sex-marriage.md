## Article summary
Southern Baptists have voted overwhelmingly to call for the overturning of the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, marking the first time the denomination has formally pursued this goal. The vote, influenced by the recent success in overturning Roe v. Wade, reflects a strategic long-term ambition among evangelical leaders to challenge Obergefell v. Hodges. The resolution, which is nonbinding, was part of a broader agenda addressing various cultural issues, including parental rights and the defunding of Planned Parenthood. It also touches on the growing concern over declining fertility rates, advocating for larger families as vital for civilizational survival. 

Despite acknowledging that same-sex marriage enjoys broad public support, Southern Baptists aim to position themselves as a prophetic minority in a changing cultural landscape. The convention, attended by about 10,500 messengers, also discussed other resolutions, including those against pornography and sports betting. While the Southern Baptist Convention faces a decline in membership, attendance at church services remains stable, indicating ongoing vitality within its congregations. The mood at the convention appeared steadier this year, with a focus on unity after recent internal conflicts. Clint Pressley was re-elected as president, emphasizing the strength of the denomination's convictions.
