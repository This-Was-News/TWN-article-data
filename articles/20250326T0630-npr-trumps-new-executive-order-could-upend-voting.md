## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that mandates proof of citizenship for voter registration, a move that could significantly alter voting processes in the U.S. This order requires individuals using a federal voter registration form to provide documentation, such as a passport, to register for federal elections. Critics, including voting rights advocates, argue that this could disenfranchise millions of eligible voters and question Trump's authority to implement such changes through executive order. The order also instructs states to remove noncitizens from voter rolls and enhances data sharing between federal and state agencies to verify voter eligibility.

Furthermore, the executive order seeks to prevent states from counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day, threatening funding for those that do. Legal experts contend that the order conflicts with existing federal voting laws and lacks the president's legal authority. Notably, it borrows elements from the Republican-backed SAVE Act, which aims to impose similar proof-of-citizenship requirements. The implications of this executive order could lead to significant legal challenges, as many fear it will exacerbate issues related to voter suppression. Only about half of Americans possess a U.S. passport, raising concerns about the feasibility of the new requirements.
