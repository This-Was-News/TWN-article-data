## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced the withholding of over $6 billion in federal education grants to schools, impacting districts' plans for the upcoming fall. This decision was communicated to state education officials just before the traditional funding deadline of July 1. The U.S. Education Department is reviewing the FY 2025 funding for several grant programs, including Title I-C, II-A, and III-A, with no timeline for when decisions will be made. Such withholding of funds is unprecedented, according to Tara Thomas from the School Superintendents Association, who emphasized the need for stable funding for responsible budgeting. The grants under review support various educational programs, including professional development for educators, after-school programs, and services for English language learners. Although the funding for Title I and IDEA remains unaffected, the withholding poses significant challenges for districts reliant on these grants. In one low-income Maine district, the loss of funding would eliminate critical enrichment activities that contribute to student engagement and success. The Education Department asserts that it is committed to ensuring taxpayer resources align with presidential priorities.
