## Article summary
President Trump is downplaying allegations that far-right activist Laura Loomer influenced the firings of National Security Council (NSC) staff. While he confirmed that some staff members were let go, he did not disclose details about the firings. Trump stated that he makes decisions based on whether he believes individuals can do their jobs or if they have loyalties elsewhere. Loomer, who has faced backlash for her controversial views and conspiracy theories, claimed in a post on X that the fired officials were disloyal and had sabotaged Trump. Although Trump acknowledged speaking with Loomer and considering her hiring recommendations, he denied her involvement in the firings. Loomer, known for her anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, has been banned from multiple social media platforms but was reinstated on X under Elon Musk's ownership. Trump referred to her as a "patriot" and a "good person." The firings come amidst scrutiny over the administration's security practices, including a breach involving a journalist in a private chat. The Pentagon's acting inspector general is now investigating the situation, following congressional direction. Despite the controversies, Trump has resisted calls to dismiss National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, asserting that no classified information was shared.
