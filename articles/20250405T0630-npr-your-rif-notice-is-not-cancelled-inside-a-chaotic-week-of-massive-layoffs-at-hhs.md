## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) experienced chaotic layoffs affecting thousands of employees across agencies like the CDC, FDA, and NIH. Many workers were abruptly informed of their termination when their security badges were deactivated. The situation was further complicated by the reinstatement of some employees, with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. admitting that a significant portion of the firings were mistakes. Confusion prevailed as managers struggled to determine who remained employed, and some staff received contradictory communications regarding their job status. 

HHS stated that the cuts, which affected about 10,000 positions, were aimed at eliminating redundant roles to realign with its core mission. However, the layoffs have raised concerns about the impact on public health programs and services, particularly those addressing critical issues like lead contamination. Many employees expressed frustration over the disorganized nature of the process, describing it as haphazard and wasteful. The restructuring has also led to fears about the future of essential support roles that enable scientific research and public health initiatives. Overall, the fallout from these layoffs has left employees feeling uncertain and anxious about the agency's direction and capabilities.
