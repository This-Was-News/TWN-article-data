## Article summary
The article discusses how President Trump has profited significantly from his presidency, with examples such as a $28 million film deal for Melania Trump and $320 million in fees from a cryptocurrency. Unlike past scandals, the public and political response has been muted, highlighting a normalization of ethical breaches in Washington. Experts suggest that Trump's administration may represent one of the most blatant uses of presidential power for personal gain in American history, surpassing previous scandals like Teapot Dome and Watergate. Despite ethical concerns, Trump's administration has eliminated accountability measures and investigations, leading to a lack of public outrage. Some signs of discontent have emerged, particularly regarding the recent gift of a luxury jet from Qatar, which raised ethical alarms among the public. Critics argue that Trump's actions contradict his previous promises to drain the swamp and maintain ethical standards. The article notes that while Republicans scrutinized Hunter Biden's finances, they show little interest in investigating Trump's financial dealings. Overall, the piece underscores the unprecedented scale of profit-making by the Trump family during his presidency and the challenges faced by critics in holding him accountable.
