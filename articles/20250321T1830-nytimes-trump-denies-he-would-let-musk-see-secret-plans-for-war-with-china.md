## Article summary
President Trump has firmly rejected the idea of allowing Elon Musk access to top-secret U.S. military plans regarding a potential conflict with China. During a press briefing, Trump stated that it would be inappropriate for a businessman with interests in China, like Musk, to have such sensitive information. This statement followed a report that suggested Musk was scheduled for a briefing at the Pentagon about U.S. military strategies concerning China. However, Trump denied that any such briefing was planned, labeling the report as "fake news."

Musk did visit the Pentagon to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military officials, but the nature of the discussions remains unclear. While some sources indicated that Musk was to be briefed on military efforts against China, others claimed he was there to provide insights based on his business experiences. Trump emphasized that Musk's extensive business dealings in China made it unwise to share classified information with him. The president expressed surprise at the report of a planned briefing, asserting it was a misunderstanding and not reflective of the actual meeting's purpose. Ultimately, Trump highlighted the importance of safeguarding sensitive information, especially from individuals with potential conflicts of interest.
