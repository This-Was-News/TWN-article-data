## Article summary
The ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir have escalated recently following a terrorist attack on April 22, which killed 26 people, primarily Indian tourists. India launched retaliatory strikes against Pakistan, claiming the attack was orchestrated by Pakistan-based terrorists, a claim Pakistan denies. The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947, shortly after the partition of India and Pakistan, when both nations laid claim to the territory, leading to their first war. A cease-fire brokered by the United Nations in 1949 established a dividing line, but subsequent wars in 1965 and 1999 further entrenched hostilities. In 1972, the cease-fire line became an official line of control, yet tensions remained high, exacerbated by insurgencies in the late 1980s. A significant diplomatic effort in 1999 failed when war broke out again over Kashmir. In August 2019, India revoked Kashmir's special status, increasing military presence and imposing strict measures, which initially reduced violence but did not resolve underlying issues. The April 2025 attack reignited hostilities, with India conducting strikes in Pakistan, prompting strong condemnation and threats of retaliation from Pakistan. The cycle of violence and political maneuvering continues to hinder peace efforts in the region.
