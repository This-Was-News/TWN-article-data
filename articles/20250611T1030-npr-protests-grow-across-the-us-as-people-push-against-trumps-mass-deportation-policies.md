## Article summary
Protests erupted across the U.S. in response to President Trump's mass deportation policies and the military's deployment in California. Thousands gathered in cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle, chanting slogans such as "ICE out of New York!" Participants expressed their concerns for vulnerable communities affected by immigration raids. One protester, Jeanet, emphasized the importance of voicing opposition to the administration's actions, especially as a future member of the military. The Trump administration aims to arrest 3,000 migrants daily, leading to nationwide raids in various locations.

While the New York protest remained peaceful, clashes occurred in Los Angeles, highlighting the tension surrounding the issue. Some attendees, like Paula Lopez, shared personal experiences of being affected by immigration enforcement, reflecting on the pain of family separations. Others, such as Arfraz, felt a responsibility to advocate for those unable to protest due to fear of deportation. The demonstrations showcased a collective effort to stand against the current immigration policies and support affected individuals and families.
