## Article summary
South Korea's military reported that North Korea is removing some of its loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, following South Korea's dismantling of its own propaganda broadcast speakers. The move is part of efforts to ease tensions, with South Korea halting its broadcasts in June after new President Lee Jae Myung took office. North Korea has not confirmed the removal of its speakers. Tensions had escalated due to North Korea's retaliatory broadcasts of irritating sounds and South Korea's propaganda messages, including K-pop songs. The previous conservative government had resumed broadcasts in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons. North Korea's influential leader Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, rejected overtures from Lee's government, citing South Korea's trust in its alliance with the United States. Tensions may rise again later this month due to upcoming joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States, which North Korea views as invasion rehearsals.
