## Article summary
SpaceX successfully launched four astronauts into orbit on the Axiom Space Ax-4 mission from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This marks the fourth private spaceflight for Axiom Space, which collaborates with SpaceX for transportation to the International Space Station (ISS) and coordinates with NASA for ISS usage. The mission faced delays due to weather and a leak in the Falcon 9 rocket, but was ultimately cleared for launch after NASA confirmed stability in the ISS's Zvedzda service module. Peggy Whitson, a retired NASA astronaut and record-holder for cumulative time in space, commands the mission, joined by pilot Shubhanshu Shukla from India and mission specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. This trip represents a significant milestone as it is the first government-sponsored spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary in over 40 years. The crew will conduct nearly 60 experiments during their 14-day stay aboard the ISS, covering various scientific disciplines. The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which is certified by NASA, will remain docked at the station until the crew's return to Earth. This launch is the 18th time SpaceX has sent humans into orbit, underscoring its pivotal role in current space exploration efforts.
