## Article summary
The recent fallout between Elon Musk and former President Trump raises concerns about the future of Musk's businesses, particularly SpaceX and Tesla, which have heavily relied on government support. Musk's companies have received at least $38 billion in federal backing over the past two decades, making them integral to U.S. space travel, national security, and electric vehicle infrastructure. Trump's threats to cut subsidies could jeopardize Musk's contracts, but experts suggest it's unlikely the government will abruptly cancel SpaceX's crucial contracts due to the company's unique capabilities. Musk's response to the threats included a brief mention of decommissioning SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, which was later retracted. 

Tesla, while facing challenges from reduced federal support for electric vehicles, is also struggling with internal issues and competition in global markets. The Trump administration's proposed cuts to EV tax credits and charging station funding could impact Tesla's growth, though the company may weather these changes better than anticipated. Despite potential short-term financial setbacks from the Trump-Musk split, analysts believe Musk has the resources to adapt and continue thriving in the long run. Overall, while the breakup might inflict some immediate pain on Musk's companies, it is unlikely to derail his overarching success.
