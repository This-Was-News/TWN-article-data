## Article summary
Three former Memphis police officers, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, were found not guilty of all charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of Tyre Nichols. Nichols, a 29-year-old father, died after being violently beaten by the officers during a traffic stop on January 7, 2023. The jury's verdict left Nichols' family devastated and outraged, as expressed by Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy. Initially, five officers were fired and charged in connection with Nichols' death, with two having pleaded guilty in federal court and testifying against their colleagues. This trial was the second for the three officers, following a previous conviction for witness tampering in a federal case.

During the trial, prosecutors argued that the officers used excessive force and failed to provide medical assistance to Nichols, while the defense maintained that the officers acted within their training and blamed Nichols for his own death. The prosecution emphasized the duty of the officers to help Nichols, who was heard moaning for assistance on video footage. The defense introduced evidence from Nichols' car, claiming it was relevant to their case, but the prosecution countered that the officers were unaware of its contents at the time of the arrest. Nichols' family has since become advocates for police reform and is suing the city of Memphis for $550 million, with the case set to go to trial next year.
