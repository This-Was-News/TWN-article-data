## Article summary
President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at removing "divisive race-centered ideology" from the Smithsonian Institution and its associated cultural bodies. The order, titled "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History," expresses concerns that the Smithsonian has adopted narratives portraying American values as harmful. It directs Vice President JD Vance to work with Congress to prohibit funding for exhibitions that do not align with shared American values or that promote divisive ideologies. Additionally, the order emphasizes celebrating achievements of women in the American Women's History Museum while rejecting the recognition of men as women.

The executive order claims that the Biden Administration has promoted a "corrosive ideology" that distorts historical truths. It also seeks to reinstate public monuments and improve the infrastructure of Independence National Historical Park in preparation for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026. The order reflects a broader effort by the Trump administration to roll back Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives in federal agencies.
