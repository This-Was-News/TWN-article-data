## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive winner of the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, delivered an inspiring speech on a Queens rooftop, emphasizing his commitment to uplift the working class and serve all New Yorkers. He vowed to halt ICE deportations, provide free public transportation, and freeze rents on regulated units. His victory signals a shift away from the Democratic establishment, represented by Andrew Cuomo, towards a coalition prioritizing the needs of the working class. Mamdani acknowledged the concerns of some Jewish New Yorkers regarding his anti-Israel stance, promising to engage with differing perspectives. Despite his apparent success, he faces challenges in the upcoming general election against Eric Adams and potential independent candidates like Cuomo. Supporters, including Representative Nydia Velázquez, warned that wealthy interests would oppose Mamdani’s campaign, which threatens the status quo. Mamdani's campaign mobilized a large number of young volunteers, showcasing a growing political activism among the youth. His proposals, however, may require tax increases and face resistance from Governor Kathy Hochul and business leaders concerned about economic stability. The enthusiasm of his supporters was evident at his victory celebration, highlighting a new wave of political engagement.
