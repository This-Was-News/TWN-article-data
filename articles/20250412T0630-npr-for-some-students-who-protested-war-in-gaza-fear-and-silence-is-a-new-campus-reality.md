## Article summary
The article discusses the fear and silence experienced by students who protested the war in Gaza, particularly in the context of the Trump administration's crackdown on activism. Many students report feeling a chilling effect on free speech and political activity, as efforts to combat antisemitism have led to increased scrutiny of pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Incidents of visa revocations and arrests, such as those of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Öztürk, have heightened anxiety among non-citizen students, who now fear for their safety and legal status. 

Students assert that their protests focus on criticizing Israeli policies, not on targeting Jewish individuals. The administration's actions have created an environment where many feel compelled to limit their activism, with some students advising their international peers to refrain from participating in protests. Calls for universities to provide better protections for non-citizen students have emerged, as students express disappointment in their institutions' responses to their needs. 

Amidst these tensions, there are ongoing civil rights investigations into universities over their handling of alleged antisemitism, which has led to significant federal funding being frozen for some institutions. Overall, the article highlights the complex interplay of activism, fear, and institutional responsibility on college campuses during a politically charged climate.
