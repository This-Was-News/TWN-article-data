## Article summary
The United States has formally proposed elements of a nuclear deal to Iran, coinciding with reports of a significant increase in Iran's stockpile of near-bomb-grade uranium. The proposal, presented by lead negotiator Steve Witkoff, includes a call for Iran to halt all uranium enrichment and suggests a regional consortium for nuclear power production involving Iran and Arab states. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed receipt of the proposal, which was mediated by Oman. Despite the offer, skepticism remains regarding Iran's willingness to comply, particularly from its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported a surge in Iran's uranium enrichment to 60%, indicating the potential for rapid weapon production. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged military action against Iran's facilities, although no immediate threats were made following the IAEA reports. The U.S. administration emphasizes the importance of a strong agreement that allows for thorough inspections. Tensions are heightened as Iran continues to stonewall IAEA inspectors regarding access to military sites linked to past nuclear activities. The situation remains complex, with Iran rejecting U.S. demands to end enrichment and asserting its right to produce civilian-grade nuclear fuel.
