## Article summary
Russia is enhancing its military presence near the Finnish border, as evidenced by recent satellite imagery showing new infrastructure, including tents, warehouses, and renovations to existing facilities. NATO officials confirm that this buildup differs from the pre-invasion mobilization seen along the Ukraine border, indicating a longer-term expansion plan. Currently, Russian troop levels are low, and Finland perceives no immediate threat, although military analysts predict a significant increase in Russian forces once the Ukraine conflict concludes. Finnish defense officials anticipate that troop numbers could triple in the coming years, with a focus on the Arctic region becoming a potential flashpoint. The Russian military is restructuring to prioritize areas facing NATO, believing that Arctic access is vital for power status. Recent activities include the return of helicopters to bases in the Arctic and a notable increase in warplanes near the Finnish border. Finnish defense leaders remain cautious, acknowledging that military force near their borders will likely escalate after the Ukraine war subsides. They emphasize the need for preparedness, even as they maintain a measured perspective on Russia's capabilities.
