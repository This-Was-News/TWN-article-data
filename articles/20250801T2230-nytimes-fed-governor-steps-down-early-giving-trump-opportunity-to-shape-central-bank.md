## Article summary
Adrana D. Kugler, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, announced her early resignation, giving President Trump the opportunity to appoint her successor and potentially influence the future leadership of the central bank. Kugler's departure follows public pressure from Trump on the Fed to lower interest rates and calls for Jerome H. Powell, the chair, to step down. The resignation opens a seat on the board, allowing Trump to reshape the Fed's top ranks and possibly appoint a new chair. Kugler, an economist with a background in labor economics, served on the board since 2023 and was the first Latino person to hold the position. Trump's ability to appoint more governors to the board increases his influence over the Fed, which is designed to operate independently of the White House.
