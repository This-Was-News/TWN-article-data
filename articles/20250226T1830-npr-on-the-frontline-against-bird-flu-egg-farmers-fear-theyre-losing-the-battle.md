## Article summary
Egg farmers are struggling against a persistent bird flu outbreak, with experts indicating that traditional containment methods are failing. The current strain of avian influenza, H5N1, has led to significant culling of infected birds, with emotional tolls on farmers evident as they manage the loss of their flocks. Despite investing millions in biosecurity measures, the virus continues to spread, raising concerns about its potential impact on human health, especially as cases in humans have increased. 

Many in the industry are advocating for the vaccination of poultry, a strategy already adopted by several countries, to help control the outbreak. However, there are fears that vaccination could hinder international trade and lead to substantial economic losses. The USDA is exploring vaccine options, but logistical challenges and concerns about current vaccine efficacy persist.

Farmers like Greg Herbruck feel overwhelmed by the situation, likening the virus to a terrorist threat. As the industry faces a growing crisis, there is a pressing need for new strategies to protect both poultry and public health, with vaccination seen as a critical tool in this ongoing battle.
