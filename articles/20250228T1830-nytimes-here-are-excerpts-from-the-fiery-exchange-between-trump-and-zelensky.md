## Article summary
The meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House escalated into a heated confrontation. Trump emphasized his alignment with the United States and expressed frustration at Zelensky's lack of gratitude for American support. He insisted that Zelensky needed to make a deal with Russia or face dire consequences, implying that the U.S. had provided significant military aid that had bolstered Ukraine's defense. Zelensky countered by recalling Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories since 2014 and criticized the effectiveness of past diplomatic efforts.

Vice President JD Vance supported Trump's stance, arguing that peace could be achieved through diplomacy rather than aggression. The exchange highlighted tensions over military strategy, with Zelensky asserting that his country had been left to fend for itself during the conflict. Trump challenged Zelensky's position, arguing that he was gambling with the lives of millions and that without U.S. support, Ukraine would be in a much worse situation.

Throughout the conversation, both leaders expressed frustration, with Trump demanding more appreciation from Zelensky and criticizing his approach to negotiations. The exchange concluded with Trump reiterating that Zelensky needed to recognize the U.S. support and the necessity of a deal to improve Ukraine's position in the ongoing conflict.
