## Article summary
The web page discusses the concept of democratic socialism, particularly in the context of Zohran Mamdani's recent primary victory in the New York mayoral race. Democratic socialism is characterized by its opposition to capitalism, advocating for a shift of power to workers, while still operating within the capitalist framework to promote left-wing policies. This ideology is often compared to social democracy, which emphasizes strong social safety nets and government involvement in areas like healthcare. Prominent figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez identify as democratic socialists, with Sanders highlighting the need to combat wealth inequality and political power concentration. The Democratic Socialists of America, a key organization in this movement, has faced internal conflicts regarding its endorsements. If elected, Mamdani would become a leading figure in democratic socialism, which currently has limited representation in U.S. politics. The page also notes that several European countries implement policies aligned with democratic socialism, such as universal healthcare. Democratic socialists advocate for policies like universal healthcare, free college tuition, and higher taxes on the wealthy. Mamdani's campaign focuses on affordability measures, including raising the minimum wage and freezing rent, reflecting the challenges of living costs in New York City.
