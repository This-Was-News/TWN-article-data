## Article summary
Verizon has decided to end many of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies in order to secure approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for its $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications. The FCC approved the deal, emphasizing Verizon's commitment to discontinuing DEI-related practices, which includes removing DEI references from training materials and dissolving its dedicated HR department for diversity. Verizon's chief legal officer acknowledged the changing regulatory landscape around DEI, indicating that the company is adapting to new governmental expectations. This shift reflects a broader trend among corporations, particularly following actions by the Trump administration against DEI initiatives. Other companies, like T-Mobile, have similarly adjusted their DEI goals to facilitate business dealings with the government. The FCC has been actively investigating companies involved in DEI practices, suggesting a pushback against such initiatives in corporate America. Many firms, even those not directly regulated, are quietly retracting their DEI efforts. This marks a significant reversal from the corporate commitments made in the wake of George Floyd's murder, when many companies pledged to enhance equity for marginalized groups. The evolving landscape indicates a diminishing emphasis on DEI across various sectors.
