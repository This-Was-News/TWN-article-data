## Article summary
U.S. tariffs have devastated Lesotho's garment industry, leading to job losses and economic turmoil. The tiny African nation, once known as the "Denim Capital of Africa," faces a crisis as factories shut down due to the 50% tariff imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The tariffs, aimed at addressing a trade imbalance, have caused widespread unemployment, with many workers, particularly women, struggling to survive. Lesotho's government has declared a two-year state of disaster to address the economic fallout, but the future remains uncertain. The crisis highlights the interconnectedness of global trade and the severe impact policy decisions can have on vulnerable communities.
