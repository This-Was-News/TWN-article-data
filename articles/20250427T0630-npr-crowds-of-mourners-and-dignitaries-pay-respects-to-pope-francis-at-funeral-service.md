## Article summary
The funeral of Pope Francis took place in Rome, drawing tens of thousands of mourners and numerous world leaders to St. Peter's Square. Following his death at 88 from heart failure and a stroke, the ceremony was a blend of remembrance and celebration of his life. Notably, it marked the first time since 1903 that a former pope was not buried within the Vatican, with Francis laid to rest at the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore. The funeral mass, presided over by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, featured traditional Catholic rites and a sermon reflecting on Francis' vision of the Church as a "field hospital" for the wounded. 

Attendees included political leaders from over 110 nations, with prominent figures such as President Trump and former President Biden present. The service honored Francis' commitment to the marginalized and was attended by clergy from various ranks. After the mass, a group representing the "poor and needy" welcomed his coffin, emphasizing his focus on society's vulnerable. Francis had requested a simple burial, reflecting his humility, with his tomb inscribed with his Latin name, "Franciscus." The public can visit his tomb starting Sunday, with a period of mourning to follow, known as the "Novemdiales."
