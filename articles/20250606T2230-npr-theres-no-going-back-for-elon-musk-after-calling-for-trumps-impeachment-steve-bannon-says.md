## Article summary
Steve Bannon, former adviser to Donald Trump, claims that Elon Musk has irreparably damaged his relationship with the president by calling for Trump's impeachment on social media. The feud escalated when Musk criticized a significant spending bill vital to Trump's agenda, prompting the president to threaten to cut government contracts with Musk's companies. Bannon emphasized that Musk "crossed the Rubicon," indicating that there is no turning back from the fallout. He noted that tensions had been building since Musk's request to extend his time as a special government employee was denied by Trump. Bannon views the situation as a national security issue, citing concerns about Musk's ties to the Chinese Communist Party and his alleged drug problems. Despite the ongoing conflict, there are reports of potential reconciliation, although Bannon remains skeptical. He characterized Musk's comments about Trump as crossing a serious line. Trump's current stance is to avoid speaking to Musk for the time being. Overall, the public feud reflects deeper political and personal rifts between the billionaire entrepreneur and the former president.
