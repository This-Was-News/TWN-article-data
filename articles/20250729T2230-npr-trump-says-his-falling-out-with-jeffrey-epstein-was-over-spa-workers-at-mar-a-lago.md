## Article summary
Former President Donald Trump revealed that his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein was due to Epstein hiring workers, including young women, away from the spa at Mar-a-Lago. Trump claimed he ended their friendship when Epstein repeatedly ignored his warnings not to poach employees. He mentioned Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein of sexual abuse, as one of the workers Epstein allegedly "stole." Trump maintained that his friendship with Epstein ended before Epstein's 2006 indictment for soliciting prostitution. Meanwhile, Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's confidant, requested immunity in exchange for testifying before the House Oversight Committee, which subpoenaed her for a deposition. Maxwell's attorneys also asked to postpone her appearance, citing the possibility of the Supreme Court reviewing her case. The committee rejected Maxwell's request for immunity and has not ruled out delaying her testimony.
