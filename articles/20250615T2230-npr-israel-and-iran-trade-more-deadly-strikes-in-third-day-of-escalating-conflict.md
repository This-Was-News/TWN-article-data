## Article summary
Israel and Iran have engaged in intense missile strikes for three consecutive days, escalating fears of a broader regional conflict. The latest exchanges occurred after U.S. talks on Iran's nuclear program were canceled. Israeli strikes targeted two energy facilities in Iran, prompting Iran to retaliate with hundreds of ballistic missiles and drones, resulting in significant casualties and damage in Israel, including the deaths of at least ten individuals. In response, Israel's military confirmed attacks on multiple Iranian targets, including nuclear sites.

The conflict has led to civilian casualties on both sides, with reports indicating at least 13 deaths in Israel and significant casualties in Iran, including high-ranking military officials. Amidst the violence, some Iranians expressed relief at the killing of their leadership, viewing it as a potential catalyst for regime change. Calls for de-escalation have emerged from international leaders, including President Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, emphasizing the need for diplomacy. The situation remains tense, with both nations continuing to launch attacks while the possibility of negotiations hangs in the balance.
