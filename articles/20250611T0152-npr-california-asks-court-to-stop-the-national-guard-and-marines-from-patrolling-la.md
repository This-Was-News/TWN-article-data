## Article summary
California is seeking a federal court order to prevent the National Guard and U.S. Marines from assisting in immigration raids or responding to protests in Los Angeles. Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a temporary restraining order to restrict military involvement in law enforcement activities, arguing that local authorities are better equipped to handle civil unrest. The state's Attorney General, Rob Bonta, claims that President Trump’s deployment of troops is illegal and that the military should not patrol civilian streets. The lawsuit follows the mobilization of 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines, which California contends was done without state consent. 

The filing warns that the military's presence could escalate tensions and lead to further unrest, contradicting Trump's claims of a rebellion in the area. Newsom criticized Trump for using service members as political tools and inflaming tensions rather than promoting peace. In response, the White House accused Newsom of failing to hold accountable those responsible for violence during protests. The proposed restraining order would limit federal troops to protecting federal property and personnel only. The court has scheduled a hearing on the matter, with the White House required to respond by Wednesday morning.
