## Article summary
A recent study published in _JAMA_ reveals that the health of U.S. children has significantly declined since 2007, with a 15 to 20 percent increase in chronic conditions like depression, anxiety, and obesity since 2011. The prevalence of behavioral issues, developmental delays, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder has also risen, alongside reports of poor sleep and increased loneliness. Mortality rates for American children have worsened, with U.S. kids being 80% more likely to die from 2010 to 2023 compared to peers in other high-income countries, largely due to factors like gun violence and substance abuse. The study highlights disparities in health care coverage as a contributing factor to these outcomes, noting that the U.S. lacks universal health care. Recent Medicaid cuts are expected to exacerbate the situation, affecting a significant portion of children enrolled in the program. Experts express concern that while initiatives like the "Make America Healthy Again" movement aim to address chronic diseases, other policies may undermine children's health interests. Overall, the study underscores a troubling trend in the decline of children's health over nearly two decades.
