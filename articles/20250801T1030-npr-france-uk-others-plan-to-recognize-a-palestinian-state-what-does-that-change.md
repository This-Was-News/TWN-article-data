## Article summary
France, the United Kingdom, and Canada are preparing to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move that could deepen their split with Israel and the United States over the ongoing war in Gaza. This recognition, expected as early as September, is driven by global outrage over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, including widespread starvation. While France plans to recognize Palestine unconditionally, the UK and Canada have tied their decisions to actions by Israel or the Palestinian Authority. The move carries diplomatic weight and signals disapproval of Israel's conduct in Gaza, potentially leading to increased pressure on Israel and changes in diplomatic relations. However, the recognition may have limited practical impact, as it does not address the complex issues on the ground, including the status of Hamas and the viability of a two-state solution.
