## Article summary
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is seeking extensive access to government databases containing sensitive personal information about millions of Americans. This includes data from agencies like the IRS and Social Security Administration, which hold details such as medical records, financial information, and personal identifiers. Privacy advocates and federal workers are alarmed, fearing potential misuse of this data, including risks of identity theft and unauthorized access to sensitive health information. Musk claims that DOGE personnel undergo the same security vetting as federal employees, yet concerns persist regarding the adequacy of these checks. Lawsuits have been filed to halt DOGE's data access and to clarify what information has already been collected. Critics warn that combining various data sets could lead to the creation of detailed profiles on individuals, reminiscent of practices seen in authoritarian regimes. The White House has reportedly restricted DOGE's access to anonymized tax data, but fears remain about future expansions of access. Experts emphasize that the integrity of Americans' privacy is at stake, with potential for the data to be lost, sold, or misused. Overall, the situation raises significant concerns about governmental oversight and the safeguarding of personal information.
