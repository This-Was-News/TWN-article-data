## Article summary
The article discusses a potential deal between Ukraine and the Trump administration regarding the exploitation of Ukraine's rich mineral resources, including titanium, lithium, oil, and natural gas. A draft agreement proposes the establishment of a U.S.-controlled fund to manage the revenues from these resources, although it does not provide security guarantees for Ukraine. Ukraine possesses over 100 major deposits of critical minerals and is a significant player in the global supply of titanium and lithium, which are essential for various industries, including technology and green energy.

Trump seeks revenue from these minerals as compensation for military aid provided to Ukraine, while Ukraine hopes to gain support in its ongoing conflict with Russia. However, obstacles to the deal include bureaucratic challenges, corruption, and the presence of some mineral deposits in war-torn areas. The article highlights that while Ukraine's mineral wealth is valuable, estimates of its worth may be inflated, and past attempts to attract foreign investment have faced difficulties due to political instability and geological challenges. The ongoing war complicates the extraction of resources, particularly in contested regions.
