## Article summary
President Trump announced plans for new tariffs on computer chips, despite previously exempting various electronics from import taxes on Chinese goods. This decision follows a Customs and Border Protection rule that temporarily spared high-tech imports, benefiting companies like Apple that rely on Chinese manufacturing. Trump's administration is preparing to investigate the impact of semiconductor imports on national security, indicating that these products will eventually face their own tariffs. Economic advisers clarified that some high-tech imports were always expected to be targeted separately from broader tariffs. The ongoing trade conflict with China continues to create uncertainty for businesses reliant on trade, with potential new tariffs threatening to increase production costs for U.S. companies. Analysts have expressed concern over the chaotic tariff changes, which complicate supply chain planning for the tech industry. As the trade war persists, U.S. consumers have begun rushing to purchase products like iPhones in anticipation of rising prices. Overall, the evolving tariff landscape reflects a complex strategy aimed at addressing trade imbalances, particularly with China.
