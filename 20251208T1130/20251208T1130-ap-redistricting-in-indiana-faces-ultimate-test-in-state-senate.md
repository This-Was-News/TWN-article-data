## Article summary
A proposal to redraw Indiana's congressional boundaries, designed to favor Republican candidates, is facing its first significant test in the state Senate. This legislation, which passed the state House last Friday, splits Indianapolis into four districts and consolidates other areas to eliminate the districts of the state's two Democratic representatives. The move aims to increase Republican power in the staunchly conservative state, aligning with a broader push by former President Donald Trump for Republican-led states to redraw maps. However, many Indiana Republicans in the Senate have expressed hesitation or opposition to mid-decade redistricting, despite pressure from Trump, including threats of primary challenges and swatting incidents against lawmakers. The Senate's decision is crucial, as the deadline to file for congressional races is in early February. If the Senate rejects the map, proponents will find it extremely difficult to attempt redistricting again. The outcome could also test Trump's influence within the Republican Party, as senators decide whether to support the controversial redistricting bid.
