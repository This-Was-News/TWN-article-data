## Article summary
As people age, their ability to tolerate alcohol diminishes due to physiological changes. The liver's enzymes, responsible for breaking down alcohol, become less efficient, leading to a slower metabolism. Additionally, a decrease in muscle mass, which stores water to dilute alcohol, results in higher blood alcohol concentrations and prolonged effects from the same amount of alcohol. For women in perimenopause, alcohol can worsen symptoms like mood swings and irritability, as it acts as a depressant and can disrupt sleep. The risks associated with alcohol consumption, including increased cancer risk, liver disease, high blood pressure, memory problems, and cognitive decline, also escalate with age. Alcohol is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, similar to tobacco and asbestos, meaning every drink increases cancer risk. While complete abstinence is the healthiest choice, reducing alcohol intake can still yield significant health benefits. Strategies like alternating alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic options and staying hydrated can mitigate negative effects. Making proactive changes to alcohol consumption in middle age can profoundly impact long-term health and well-being, potentially leading to better sleep and reduced anxiety.
