## Article summary
The Supreme Court is hearing a case that could significantly alter the balance of power between Congress and the president by potentially ending the independence of federal agencies. The case centers on the firing of Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic appointee to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), by the Trump administration. Congress established the FTC in 1914 as a bipartisan, independent agency, with commissioners removable only for specific causes like inefficiency or malfeasance. Slaughter was removed without stated cause, leading her to sue and a lower court to rule in her favor. The Trump administration is appealing this ruling, arguing that a 1935 Supreme Court precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protected agency independence, was based on a flawed understanding of the FTC's powers. They contend that the FTC, and similar agencies, exercise executive power and that presidents should have the authority to remove officials for any reason. This argument challenges the long-standing principle that independent agencies are shielded from direct presidential control to ensure non-partisan decision-making. The administration's position is supported by recent court decisions that have allowed presidential firings of heads of single-director agencies, distinguishing them from multimember boards. Slaughter and her supporters argue that preserving agency independence is crucial for impartial decision-making based on facts and the public interest. Conversely, some legal scholars argue that such independent agencies are inherently unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's decision in this case, and a related one concerning a Federal Reserve governor, could reshape the structure and accountability of the federal government.
