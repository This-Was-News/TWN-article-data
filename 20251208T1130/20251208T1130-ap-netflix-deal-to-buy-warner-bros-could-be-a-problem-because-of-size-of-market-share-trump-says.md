## Article summary
President Donald Trump stated that Netflix's potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery could pose a problem due to the significant market share the combined entity would possess. Trump indicated his involvement in the government's decision-making process regarding the approval of the $72 billion deal. He acknowledged Netflix as a successful company and its CEO, Ted Sarandos, as a respected individual, having met with him recently. However, Trump reiterated concerns about the "very big market share" that would result from the merger, which could reshape the entertainment landscape. The deal, if approved, would unite two major streaming services and combine Warner's extensive content library, including DC Studios properties and franchises like Harry Potter, with Netflix's own vast offerings and production capabilities. Trump expressed uncertainty about the ultimate outcome but emphasized that the market share aspect is a key consideration.
