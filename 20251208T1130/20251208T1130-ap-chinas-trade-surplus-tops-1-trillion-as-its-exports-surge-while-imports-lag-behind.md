## Article summary
China's trade surplus for 2025 has surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, driven by a surge in exports in November that grew 5.9% year-on-year, while imports saw a more modest increase of nearly 2%. This marks a record high for the surplus, exceeding the total for the previous year. Although exports to the U.S. have significantly declined, China is successfully diversifying its export markets to regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. The recent trade truce between China and the U.S., which includes tariff reductions, is expected to further boost exports in the coming months. Despite a contraction in China's factory activity for the eighth consecutive month, economists anticipate China will meet its annual growth target of around 5%. Chinese leaders are prioritizing advanced manufacturing for the next five years and are focusing on stability amidst global trade challenges. Analysts predict China will continue to gain global export market share, potentially reaching 16.5% by 2030, fueled by strengths in sectors like electric vehicles and robotics, even amidst ongoing trade tensions and protectionism.
