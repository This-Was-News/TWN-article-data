## Article summary
The 48th Kennedy Center Honors celebrated a diverse group of honorees including the rock band KISS, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, actor Sylvester Stallone, and musical theater star Michael Crawford. President Trump, who became the first president to host the awards and was closely involved in selecting the honorees, emphasized tributes over politics. Presenters like Kurt Russell, Kelsey Grammer, and Vince Gill shared personal anecdotes and performances related to the honorees' careers. Actor Sylvester Stallone was honored with a performance of scores from "Rocky" by composer Bill Conti. Michael Crawford, star of "The Phantom of the Opera," was celebrated by Kelsey Grammer, who also praised Trump's investment in the Kennedy Center. Country music legend George Strait, known as "The King of Country Music," was honored by Garth Brooks and Miranda Lambert. Disco icon Gloria Gaynor had her hit "I Will Survive" performed by Elle King. The rock band KISS, with three living members honored, had their enduring legacy celebrated by Garth Brooks and a performance of "Rock and Roll All Nite" by Cheap Trick. Despite allegations of cronyism and corruption launched by Senate Democrats into Trump's handling of the Center, the event largely focused on artistic achievements. CBS is scheduled to broadcast the honors on December 23rd.
