## Article summary
Senator Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated he has no objection to the public release of a video depicting a U.S. military strike that killed two survivors of an initial attack on a suspected drug boat. Cotton believes the video shows nothing remarkable and supports its declassification, arguing that the two survivors remained a valid target as they were not incapacitated. This stance aligns him with President Trump and some Democrats who favor releasing the footage. However, Cotton disagrees with top Democrats like Representative Jim Himes and Representative Adam Smith, who viewed the video and found it disturbing, disputing Cotton's characterization. Himes and Smith believe the survivors were defenseless and not in a position to continue fighting, raising questions about the legality of the second strike. Legal experts have also questioned the legality of attacking survivors at sea, citing international law and Pentagon protocols against firing on the shipwrecked. The incident occurred during a series of U.S. strikes on vessels near Venezuela, which the administration claims were ferrying drugs. The Navy admiral commanding the strikes, Frank Mitch Bradley, informed lawmakers that he ordered the second attack because the boat and its cargo were believed to still be a threat, though he denied receiving a direct order to kill all survivors. The ongoing inquiries on Capitol Hill reflect bipartisan concerns regarding the mission and its execution.
