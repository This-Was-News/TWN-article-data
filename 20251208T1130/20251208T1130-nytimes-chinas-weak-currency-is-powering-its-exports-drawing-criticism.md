## Article summary
Chinas currency, the renminbi, is significantly undervalued against those of its major trading partners, making Chinese goods and services cheaper internationally and boosting the country's exports. This currency weakness, estimated by some Chinese economists to be as much as a third, contributes to a notable price discrepancy, with items like hotel stays, fast food, electronics, and cars costing substantially less in China than in other countries. While the low currency value is a major factor, other elements also contribute to China's low prices, including a decline in the housing market that has reduced household savings and consumer spending, as well as chronic overcapacity in Chinese factories leading to price cuts. The renminbi's current exchange rate requires about 7.1 renminbi to purchase one U.S. dollar. This situation has fueled Chinas exports to record levels, with the country's trade surplus exceeding $1 trillion this year. Despite the economic benefits, such as job creation in export-oriented industries, Chinese officials generally avoid discussing the currency's low value. However, some influential Chinese economists are beginning to voice concerns that the renminbi's weakness is misaligned with the country's underlying economic fundamentals.
