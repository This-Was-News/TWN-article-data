## Article summary
China's trade surplus has surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, reaching $1.08 trillion through November of this year, an increase of 21.7 percent from the previous year. Despite U.S. tariffs, China continues to export significantly more to the United States than it imports, partly by shifting final assembly of goods to other countries to bypass tariffs. Chinese exports are flooding markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America, challenging manufacturers in traditional powerhouse nations like Germany and South Korea, and leading to production cuts or closures in developing countries. A key factor is the weak renminbi, China's currency, which has made its exports cheaper, while falling prices within China and rising prices in Europe and the U.S. have further boosted its trade. The renminbi's undervaluation, potentially by 30 percent against the euro, makes it exceedingly difficult for European competitors to match Chinese prices. This export success has financed technological innovation and provided resources for China to assist other authoritarian nations. Chinese leaders are considering allowing the renminbi to strengthen to boost domestic consumer spending, though this would hurt exporters and potentially slow the transfer of manufacturing to China. Some economists argue that China must eventually accept a narrower trade surplus, or even a deficit, to expand domestic demand and benefit its consumers.
