## Article summary
The Trump administration has revised the National Park Service's fee-free calendar for the upcoming year, removing Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth while adding President Trump's birthday, which falls on Flag Day, June 14. This change is part of a broader effort to promote a specific narrative of American history on federal lands. The updated calendar also includes the 110th anniversary of the NPS on August 25, Constitution Day on September 17, and President Teddy Roosevelt's birthday on October 27. These new fee-free dates will be effective starting January 1. A new "America-first pricing" policy will continue to require non-U.S. residents to pay entrance fees on these days. Additionally, international visitors will face a $100 surcharge at 11 popular national parks and a $250 annual pass, while residents will pay $80 for their annual pass. This initiative stems from a July executive order aimed at increasing fees for international visitors and providing preferential access to citizens and residents. The Department of the Interior has termed these new fee-exemptedempted dates "patriotic fee-free days," emphasizing their commitment to making parks more accessible and affordable for Americans. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum stated that these policies ensure U.S. taxpayers supporting the park system continue to have affordable access, while international visitors contribute to park maintenance. This move follows previous administration actions to reshape the portrayal of American history in national parks, including a request for visitors to flag any signs perceived as casting a negative light on Americans.
