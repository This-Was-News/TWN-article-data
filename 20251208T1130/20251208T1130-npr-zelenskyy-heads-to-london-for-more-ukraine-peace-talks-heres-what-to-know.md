## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is traveling to London for crucial meetings with European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. This gathering aims to demonstrate continued European solidarity and support for Ukraine's peace plan. However, Zelenskyy faces a challenging diplomatic landscape due to perceived wavering commitment from the Trump administration and Russia's continued military aggression. The Trump administration has proposed a peace plan favoring Russia, which Ukraine has rejected due to its territorial concessions and limitations on Ukraine's military and NATO aspirations. Despite recent talks, breakthroughs remain elusive, with Russia simultaneously escalating attacks. European leaders are emphasizing the importance of Ukraine's territorial integrity and self-defense, viewing the continent's stability as linked to Ukraine's security. Concerns are mounting that the U.S. might reduce its support, not only for Ukraine but also for Europe's broader security guarantees, as signaled by a new national security strategy. European nations are exploring ways to increase their support, including scaling up weapons production and utilizing frozen Russian assets, though some, like Belgium, have resisted the latter. Russia, meanwhile, continues its demands for territorial recognition and limits on Ukraine's alliances, underscoring its battlefield assertiveness. The potential for the U.S. to disengage from the conflict, as suggested by Donald Trump Jr., adds another layer of uncertainty to the ongoing peace efforts.
