## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with the leaders of France, Germany, and Britain in London to discuss a U.S.-backed peace plan for the Russia-Ukraine war. The talks are focused on security, air defense, and long-term funding for Ukraine's defense efforts, with an emphasis on ensuring solid security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have been working to bridge differences on the peace proposal, a key point of contention being the suggestion that Ukraine cede territory in the eastern Donbas region to Russia. President Donald Trump has expressed frustration, claiming Zelenskyy has not yet read the proposal and suggesting Ukraine should cede land to end the conflict. The European discussions follow the release of a new U.S. national security strategy that has raised concerns among European allies and been welcomed by Russia, as it suggests improving relations with Moscow and questions NATO's expansion. While diplomatic efforts are underway, Russian forces continue to attack Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure and launching drone strikes. Russia's Ministry of Defense reported destroying 67 Ukrainian drones overnight over various Russian regions.
