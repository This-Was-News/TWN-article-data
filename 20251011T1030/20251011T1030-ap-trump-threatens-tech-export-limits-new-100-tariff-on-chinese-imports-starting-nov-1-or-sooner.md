## Article summary
President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, or sooner, in response to China's new export controls on rare earth elements. Trump expressed frustration with China's actions, calling them shocking and hostile, and suggested that a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping might not occur during his upcoming trip to South Korea. The Chinese government restricted access to rare earth minerals and technologies used in their production, potentially impacting global supply chains. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% due to concerns about rising tensions between the U.S. and China. The trade war, which had seen some de-escalation, could reignite, potentially causing global economic growth to slump. Trump's threats, while definitive, have been known to be backed down from in the past. The U.S. and China have been in a trade standoff, with both countries imposing restrictions on various goods and services. The latest actions by both sides could further complicate the global supply chain of rare earth elements. Analysts suggest there is still room for de-escalation and mutual compromise to keep diplomatic channels open.
