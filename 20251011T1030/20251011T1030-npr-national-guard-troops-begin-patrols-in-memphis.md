## Article summary
National Guard troops have started patrolling in Memphis as part of a federal task force established by President Trump to combat crime. The task force includes agents from multiple federal agencies and was initiated after the Trump administration described Memphis as overwhelmed by violent crime. A small number of Guard members were already in Memphis for planning purposes. The deployment's scale and locations remain unclear. Unlike other cities, the Guard in Memphis operates under the governor's command. Critics argue the administration is unfairly targeting Democratic-led cities, and legal experts worry about presidential power limits. The task force aims to reduce crime, enforce immigration laws, and support local police. Governor Bill Lee assured that troops will serve in support roles and remain unarmed unless requested. Local leaders, including Mayor Paul Young, express caution, emphasizing the city's progress in reducing crime and need for support in addressing homelessness and urban blight. Memphis has historically high crime levels, with over 340 homicides in 2023.
