## Article summary
President Donald Trump's plans to deploy the National Guard in Chicago and Portland have been stalled by judges, but troops are now patrolling in Memphis with the support of the state's governor. The troops, equipped with protective gear and firearms, have been seen patrolling areas like a Bass Pro Shops store and a tourist welcome center. Trump has also considered sending troops to other cities, including Baltimore, Washington D.C., New Orleans, and several California cities, to support immigration agents and protect federal property. In Memphis, the Guard troops are under the command of Governor Bill Lee, who supports their use to aid a federal crackdown on crime. Meanwhile, Trump's attempts to deploy troops in Portland and Chicago have faced opposition from state and local leaders, leading to federal courts blocking these deployments. Federal officials claim that the task force in Memphis has made hundreds of arrests and issued thousands of traffic citations. In Illinois, senators were denied access to an ICE facility, raising concerns about transparency. A federal judge blocked the deployment of troops in Chicago, citing violations of the 10th and 14th Amendments. Similar legal battles are ongoing in Oregon, with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing arguments. Despite these challenges, troops from Texas and Illinois have been activated and are patrolling outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.
