## Article summary
The federal government shutdown, now in its second week, is beginning to impact various segments of Americans. Key medical services for Native American communities have been curtailed, veterans are denied access to career counseling, and taxpayers face delays in IRS services. Farmers struggle with planning next year's crops due to uncertainty over federal assistance. Over 4,000 federal employees have been laid off, and about 600,000 workers are furloughed or working without pay. President Trump has intensified pressure on Democrats, threatening to withhold back pay for some federal workers. The shutdown has also affected construction projects, air traffic control staffing, and funding for low-income nutrition programs, highlighting the growing strain on vulnerable populations.
