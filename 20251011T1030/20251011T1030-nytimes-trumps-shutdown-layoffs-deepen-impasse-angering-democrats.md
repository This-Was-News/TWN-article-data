## Article summary
President Trump's decision to lay off federal workers and threaten others with unpaid work aims to pressure Democrats into reopening the government, but this has strengthened Democrats' resolve. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, who represent Virginia—a state heavily reliant on federal employees—have remained firm in their stance. They are channeling the anger of federal workers who feel targeted by the White House. The shutdown's impact is particularly severe in Virginia, making the threat of further cuts less effective. Democrats are determined not to concede as the shutdown continues into its second week, fueled by the frustrations of federal employees who have faced chaos and fear of retaliation under the current administration.
