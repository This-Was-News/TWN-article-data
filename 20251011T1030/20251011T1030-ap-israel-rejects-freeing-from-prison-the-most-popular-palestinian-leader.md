## Article summary
Israel has rejected freeing Marwan Barghouti, a popular Palestinian leader, and other high-profile prisoners as part of a ceasefire deal with Hamas. Barghouti, serving multiple life sentences for attacks in Israel, is seen by some as a unifying figure for Palestinians. Israel views him as a terrorist leader but fears his potential to rally Palestinians. Hamas insists on his release, but Israel has refused in previous exchanges. The ceasefire involves the release of about 20 Israeli hostages and 250 Palestinians, with many of the latter being members of Hamas and Fatah. The prisoner releases hold significant emotional weight for both Israelis and Palestinians. Barghouti, a advocate for a two-state solution, has been compared to Nelson Mandela. He was convicted in 2004 for his involvement in attacks that killed five people. Barghouti's release could strengthen Palestinian institutions, which Israel's right-wing government opposes. His popularity and potential leadership role pose a threat to both Israeli and Palestinian authorities.
