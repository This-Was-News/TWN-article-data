## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown has entered its 11th day with no sign of progress on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers have repeatedly voted on two proposals to reopen the government, but both have failed to gain enough support. Senators admit they are not formally negotiating, and the stalemate reflects a hyper-politicized environment. Democrats are holding out for a deal to renew expiring health insurance subsidies, while Republicans are pushing for a short-term spending bill. Despite the impasse, some lawmakers are maintaining a bipartisan spirit, engaging in discussions and informal gatherings. The Senate did pass the annual defense bill with bipartisan support, but the shutdown continues to cause tension and uncertainty. Senators express frustration with the repetitive votes and the lack of progress, but remain committed to finding a solution. The shutdown has led to mass layoffs of federal workers, adding to the urgency of resolving the issue.
