## Article summary
President Trump issued a Columbus Day proclamation to 'reclaim' the explorer's legacy, emphasizing his 'extraordinary legacy of faith, courage, perseverance, and virtue.' The proclamation criticizes 'left-wing arsonists' for attempting to dishonor Columbus's memory. While Columbus Day is recognized in 30 states and three U.S. territories, 17 states and D.C. commemorate Indigenous Peoples Day instead. Christopher Columbus, born in Italy in 1451, sailed to the Americas in 1492, but never reached what is now the U.S. Columbus Day was first commemorated in 1892 and became a federal holiday in 1934. Critics argue that Columbus's arrival triggered a mass genocide of Indigenous people. Despite the controversy, Trump encouraged Americans to celebrate Columbus Day and display the U.S. flag. Some, like Rep. Elise Stefanik and Rep. Mike Lawler, praised the proclamation, while others, such as professor Kerri Malloy and Matthew Fletcher, criticized it for ignoring the darker aspects of Columbus's legacy and the impact on Indigenous people.
