## Article summary
President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, in response to China's new export controls on rare earth elements. Trump expressed frustration with China's actions, calling them 'shocking' and 'out of the blue,' and suggested that his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping might not occur during his upcoming trip to South Korea. The Chinese government restricted access to rare earth minerals and technologies used in their production, citing national security concerns. Trump also hinted at potential U.S. export controls on critical software from American firms. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% due to worries about escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. Analysts noted that Trump's threats could push up inflation and compound political worries. The U.S. and China have been in a trade war since earlier tariffs were announced, with both sides agreeing to reduce tariffs after negotiations. However, tensions remain high, with both countries imposing restrictions on various goods and technologies. Experts suggested that there is still room for de-escalation, but neither side appears willing to back down.
