## Article summary
A U.S. citizen, Frank Miranda, was detained by plainclothes officers in Portland, Oregon, and held at an ICE building for hours before being released. Miranda was approached by masked agents who did not identify themselves and accused him of being an overstay. He informed the officers he was born in California and had done nothing wrong. Despite his protests, he was struck, handcuffed, and taken to the ICE building. Miranda was eventually released and driven back to his workplace. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This incident is reportedly the first of its kind in Oregon, though similar detentions have occurred in other states. Aggressive immigration enforcement has been a key part of President Donald Trump's agenda. Democratic Rep. Janelle Bynum expressed outrage over the incident. Miranda's attorney, Michael Fuller, has requested documentation and information from DHS to understand the justification for the detention.
