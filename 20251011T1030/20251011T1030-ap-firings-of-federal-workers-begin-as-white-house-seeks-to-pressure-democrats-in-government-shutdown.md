## Article summary
The White House has begun mass firings of federal workers as the government shutdown enters its 10th day, aiming to pressure Democratic lawmakers. Over 4,000 employees are expected to be fired, with the hardest hits at the Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, and Housing and Urban Development departments. President Trump stated that the firings would target Democrat-oriented areas, though specifics were not provided. Some Republicans, including Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, criticized the move, while Democrats blamed Trump for the layoffs. The American Federation of Government Employees sued to halt the firings, calling them an abuse of power. The shutdown has led to 750,000 furloughed employees, and talks to end it are nearly nonexistent. The layoffs have affected agencies like the Education Department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Democrats argue the firings could be illegal, while Republicans attempt to persuade Democratic holdouts to vote for a stopgap bill. The Partnership for Public Service warns that the reductions will further deplete the federal workforce, impacting public service capacity.
