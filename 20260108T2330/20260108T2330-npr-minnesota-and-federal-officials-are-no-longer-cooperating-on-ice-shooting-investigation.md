## Article summary
Minnesota and federal officials have ceased cooperation on the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis. Governor Tim Walz urged the federal government to "leave Minnesota alone" and allow state officials to lead the investigation, expressing concerns about a fair outcome given early judgments from federal leaders. Vice President Vance defended the ICE agent's actions, stating the agent's life was in danger as Good's SUV allegedly attempted to drive towards an officer during a "legitimate law enforcement operation." Walz characterized the ICE presence as a "reckless ICE mobilization," while Vance blamed the "far left" for radicalizing segments of the population against ICE agents. Both acknowledged the need for an investigation, with Walz citing Minnesota's experience with high-profile cases like George Floyd's murder. However, the state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension stated it has been removed from the investigation in favor of federal oversight. The federal government, through the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security, asserts its capability to conduct the investigation independently.
