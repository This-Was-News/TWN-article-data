## Article summary
The annual 'Worst in Show' list, compiled by consumer and privacy advocates, highlights the most invasive, wasteful, or fragile products showcased at CES. Samsung's Bespoke AI Family Hub refrigerator received the top "Worst in Show" award for its complicated AI features and potential reliability issues, despite Samsung's claims of simplifying home life. Amazon's Ring doorbell system was criticized for its new AI features, including facial recognition and mobile surveillance capabilities, raising privacy alarms. The "Peoples Choice" award went to Ami, an AI companion marketed as a "soulmate" that tracks eye movements and emotional signals, sparking concerns about its "always-on" nature. A musical lollipop called Lollipop Star was dinged for environmental waste due to its non-rechargeable and non-reusable nature. Merach's internet-connected treadmill, featuring an AI coach that collects biometric data, raised security concerns due to its privacy policy's inability to guarantee data security. German company Bosch received two awards: one for its "Personal AI Barista" espresso machine with subscription-based features and voice assistance, and another for its e-bike app's anti-theft and battery lock feature, which critics argue makes repairs difficult. Judges aim to shame manufacturers into improving their products and address industry-wide trends rather than target specific companies.
