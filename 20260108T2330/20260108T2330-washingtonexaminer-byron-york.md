## Article summary
President Donald Trump has expressed concern that if the Democratic Party wins the upcoming midterm elections, they will attempt to impeach him, citing his previous impeachments. Historically, the president's party tends to lose seats in midterm elections, and Trump's current job performance rating is similar to that before the 2018 midterms when Republicans lost 40 House seats. The economy is identified as the most crucial issue for voters, with many feeling Trump has not prioritized it enough, despite some positive economic indicators. Trump's focus on foreign affairs, such as the Israel-Gaza and Ukraine-Russia wars, has overshadowed domestic economic concerns for voters. Despite his self-portrayal as a president of peace, voters are generally not interested in foreign policy unless the U.S. is directly involved in a conflict. Recognizing this, White House chief of staff Suzie Wiles announced a pivot to focus on the economy and campaigning for the 2026 elections, with Trump planning rallies and a televised speech. However, Trump's subsequent military action in Venezuela and his statements about long-term U.S. control there have shifted the focus away from the economic pivot. The article suggests that the Venezuela affair may not be perceived by voters as Trump addressing their most important issues and that focusing less on foreign adventures and more on the cost of living would be more beneficial if he wishes to avoid impeachment.
