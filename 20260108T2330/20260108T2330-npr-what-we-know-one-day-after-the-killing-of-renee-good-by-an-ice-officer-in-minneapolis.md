## Article summary
Renee Nicole Good, 37, was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday, sparking vigils, protests, and competing narratives. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the officer acted in self-defense after Good allegedly impeded ICE agents and used her vehicle as a weapon, calling her actions an "act of domestic terrorism." Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison disputed this, describing Good as a "legal observer" and "poet" acting on behalf of immigrant neighbors. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the shooting as a "reckless use of power" and demanded ICE units leave the city. Governor Tim Walz linked the incident to federal policies designed to "generate fear" and "conflict." Eyewitness accounts and video footage suggest Good may have received conflicting orders from agents before driving away and being shot. The investigation into the shooting has faced complications, with initial plans for a joint FBI and Bureau of Criminal Apprehension inquiry being altered to an FBI-led investigation, raising concerns about public confidence from the state's attorney general.
