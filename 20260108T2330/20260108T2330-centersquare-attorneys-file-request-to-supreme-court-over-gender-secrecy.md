## Article summary
The Thomas More Society has submitted an emergency application to the U.S. Supreme Court concerning California's gender secrecy policies in schools, as seen in the Mirabelli v. Bonta lawsuit. This action follows the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals granting California's request to pause a permanent injunction, finding no clear evidence that the policies prevent parents from accessing information about their children. The emergency request emphasizes that these policies infringe upon parents' fundamental rights to direct their children's upbringing, education, and medical treatment, as well as the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. The case originated when two teachers sued the Escondido Unified School District and the California Department of Education over policies requiring staff to use students' preferred pronouns and withhold gender identity information from parents. A class action lawsuit was certified in December, but the 9th Circuit later temporarily suspended an injunction against these policies. Attorneys argue that the Constitution does not permit the state to usurp parental authority or compel deception. In addition to the Supreme Court application, a request for en banc reconsideration by an 11-judge panel of the 9th Circuit has also been filed. The Thomas More Society asserts that parents' rights and children's well-being are too important to delay seeking relief.
