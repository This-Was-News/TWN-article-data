## Article summary
In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, President Trump discussed his views on global affairs, domestic policy, and personal health. He asserted that his power is constrained only by his own morality and expressed a belief that the United States could remain involved in Venezuela for years. Trump also addressed his health, stating he feels physically the same as he did 40 years ago and has not taken obesity drugs but probably should. He defended his family's international business activities, arguing he received no credit for limiting them in his first term. Trump reiterated his support for reducing the number of childhood vaccines and discussed his administration's steps to potentially strip citizenship from some naturalized Americans, particularly those of Somali descent, whom he believes "hate our country." He also stated he always respects election results but claims U.S. elections are rigged. Regarding potential conflicts of interest, he saw no reason to limit his family's endeavors, citing George Washington as conducting business while president. Trump revealed he has made a decision on his next Fed chair nominee but declined to name the individual. He also mentioned that music mogul Sean Combs had requested a pardon via letter, but he is not considering it, nor is he considering pardons for other high-profile inmates. Trump also voiced frustration with his administration targeting highly skilled workers in immigration crackdowns, contrasting his views with Stephen Miller's hard-line approach.
