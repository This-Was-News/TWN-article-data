## Article summary
President Trump presented multiple facets during a nearly two-hour interview, shifting between a complainer, a gracious host, a father figure to his aides, and a builder focused on White House renovations. He projected indefatigability, emphasizing his stamina and energy despite concerns about his age. Trump reminisced about his real estate successes, suggesting he might have been better at it than politics. He eagerly showcased his plans for a new White House ballroom, highlighting the marble flooring and presidential portraits he had installed. The interview also touched upon his perceived lack of respect from the media, political figures, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee, lamenting that he had ended wars but not received the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump fielded questions about his health calmly, asserting he felt as he did 40 years ago and maintained a daily aspirin regimen. He also expressed grievances, particularly regarding the mayor of New York City, and contrasted his own perceived lack of recognition with that of former President Obama. Throughout the encounter, Trump aimed to present himself as a world leader, a builder, and an "upgrader" of everything he touches, wanting his audience to witness every version of himself.
