## Article summary
Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota has authorized the state's National Guard to assist law enforcement in response to rising tensions following an immigration enforcement officer-involved shooting. The shooting resulted in the death of Renee Nicole Good, who allegedly attempted to run over an ICE officer. While the National Guard is currently on standby, Governor Walz has indicated a readiness to deploy them if necessary to maintain peace and public safety. He stated that thousands of people have peacefully expressed their views and that he believes this peace will continue. The executive order also allows for the allocation of additional resources to local law enforcement in Minneapolis. Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan emphasized the importance of peaceful demonstrations and ensuring public safety. Although protests have largely been peaceful, some videos have shown protesters engaging with law enforcement. The governor's actions signal a proactive approach to managing potential escalations amid the ongoing situation.
