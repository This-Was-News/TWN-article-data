## Article summary
In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, President Trump declared that his power as commander in chief is limited only by his own morality, suggesting he does not need to abide by international law. He views national strength as the primary factor in international relations, rather than laws or treaties. Trump discussed his administration's actions, including a potential strike on Colombia and the removal of the Venezuelan government, framing them as examples of coercive diplomacy. He also expressed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally, emphasizing the importance of ownership over treaties. Trump asserted that he is the reason NATO nations have increased defense spending and claimed that Russia would have already taken Ukraine if not for his actions. He appeared unconcerned about the expiration of a nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, believing a better one could be negotiated, potentially including China. Regarding China's potential actions towards Taiwan, Trump expressed confidence that Xi Jinping would not attempt an invasion during his presidency. Domestically, Trump indicated that judges have limited power over his policy agenda and suggested workarounds for potential legal challenges, even raising the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces within the U.S. if he deemed it necessary.
