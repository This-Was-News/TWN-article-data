## Article summary
In a significant political move, the House of Representatives has voted to extend health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act recipients, defying Republican leadership. This action, supported by a coalition of Democrats and some Republicans, aims to address the lapse in enhanced tax credits that expired late last year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would increase the national deficit by approximately $80.6 billion over a decade but also expand health insurance coverage.

In other news, President Trump has proposed the government purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to lower interest rates, aiming to address concerns about home prices ahead of midterm elections. The administration is also asserting control over Venezuelan oil by seizing tankers and planning to oversee global sales, following the U.S. military's apprehension of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. This move has drawn criticism from Russia, which denounced the U.S. seizure of a tanker as a violation of international law.

President Trump's expressed desire to acquire Greenland has sparked international concern, with European leaders and Greenlandic officials emphasizing the island's right to self-determination and adherence to international law. Despite these objections, the White House has not ruled out military options. Historically, the U.S. has shown interest in acquiring Greenland on multiple occasions, including a formal purchase offer in 1946.

Additionally, the Senate has advanced a resolution to limit the President's war powers regarding Venezuela, reflecting unease among some Republicans about the administration's expanding military actions. The Senate has also agreed to display a plaque honoring police who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, despite objections from House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Finally, Vice President JD Vance has criticized media coverage of an ICE shooting in Minneapolis and stated that Denmark has not adequately secured Greenland, suggesting the U.S. may need to take further action. The White House has also detailed plans for a new $400 million ballroom construction, deeming demolition of the East Wing more economical than renovation.
