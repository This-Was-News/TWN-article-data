## Article summary
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, despite opposition from Speaker Mike Johnson. This measure, forced by a discharge petition, is expected to pass the House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate. However, a bipartisan group of senators is reportedly close to a compromise on ACA subsidies, potentially involving a two-year extension with options for Health Savings Accounts and an income cap. This legislative push comes as Congress faces other pressing issues, including a January 30th deadline to fund the government and a Senate vote on blocking further U.S. military engagement in Venezuela without congressional authorization. The House is also expected to vote on overriding two of President Trump's recent vetoes. The debate over healthcare costs has been a significant focus, with the expiration of enhanced subsidies leading to premium spikes. The proposed Senate compromise aims to address Republican concerns, including the use of federal funds for abortion and the overall structure of the subsidies. Meanwhile, the situation in Venezuela and the looming government shutdown add to the busy legislative agenda for the new year.
