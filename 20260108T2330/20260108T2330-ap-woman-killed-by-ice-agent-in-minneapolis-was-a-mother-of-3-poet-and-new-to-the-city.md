## Article summary
Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis. Good, a U.S. citizen born in Colorado, had recently moved to Minnesota and had no significant criminal record beyond a traffic ticket. She described herself as a poet, writer, wife, and mom on social media. According to her ex-husband, she was driving with her partner when they encountered ICE agents. Bystander videos show an officer demanding she open her car door, and when she began to drive away, another officer fired into the vehicle. While Trump administration officials labeled her a domestic terrorist who attempted to ram agents, her ex-husband stated she was not an activist and had no history of protests. Good was a devoted Christian, enjoyed singing, and had studied creative writing, even winning a prize for her work. She had a daughter and two sons from previous marriages. Her mother described her as exceptionally kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving, and affectionate.
