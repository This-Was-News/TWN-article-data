## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the federal government will purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds. This action is intended to reduce interest rates and lower monthly mortgage payments, making homeownership more affordable. Trump stated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, entities supporting the U.S. housing market, possess approximately $200 billion in cash, which will facilitate this bond purchase. The move comes as housing costs have escalated significantly in recent decades. A report from the National Association of Realtors indicated that the median age for first-time homebuyers recently reached a record high of 40 years old. The share of first-time homebuyers in the market has also declined to its lowest point since 1981. The Treasury Department has previously engaged in buying mortgage bonds, notably during the 2008 and 2009 housing crisis. This initiative aims to address the growing affordability challenges in the housing market by directly influencing mortgage rates.
