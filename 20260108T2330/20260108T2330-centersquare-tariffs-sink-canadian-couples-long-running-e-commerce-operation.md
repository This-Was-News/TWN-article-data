## Article summary
Lana and Brad Bain, Canadian e-commerce entrepreneurs with nearly 30 years of experience selling antiques online, have seen their business severely impacted by U.S. tariffs. The elimination of the de minimis loophole, which allowed goods under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, created significant challenges. In August 2025, Canada Post suspended shipping to the U.S., forcing the Bains to refund outstanding orders and leaving them with warehouses full of merchandise. They now face substantial pre-paid tariffs on items, with taxes and fees sometimes amounting to half the cost of an item, drastically reducing their profit margins. To survive, the couple plans to open a brick-and-mortar store on their property in the spring. Meanwhile, a group called We Pay the Tariffs reports that American businesses and consumers paid $175 billion in tariffs from March to October 2025, highlighting the broad economic impact. The U.S. Supreme Court is also expected to rule on a legal challenge to President Donald Trump's tariffs.
