## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to safeguard Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts from seizure by creditors or courts. The order, citing national security and foreign policy interests, aims to protect the U.S. from illegal immigration and illicit narcotics, and to foster stability in Venezuela. This action follows a recent U.S. operation in Venezuela's capital that led to the apprehension of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife on federal charges. Trump stated that the U.S. would assist in governing Venezuela until it achieves political and economic stability. The executive order clarifies that these funds are sovereign assets of Venezuela and not subject to private legal claims. The U.S. government will hold these funds in a custodial capacity. The order emphasizes that the failure to protect these funds would significantly impede U.S. foreign policy objectives. These objectives include ending the influx of illegal immigrants and narcotics, protecting American interests from actors like Iran and Hezbollah, and promoting peace and prosperity in Venezuela and the Western Hemisphere.
