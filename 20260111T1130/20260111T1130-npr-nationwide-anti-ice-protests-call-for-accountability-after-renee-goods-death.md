## Article summary
Nationwide protests erupted across the U.S. this weekend, demanding justice and accountability following the death of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis. Indivisible, a progressive grassroots coalition, helped coordinate over 1,000 events under the banner "ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action." Protesters expressed grief, honored the deceased, and called for an end to what they describe as a system operating with impunity. Demonstrators in Minneapolis chanted "ICE out now!" and voiced concerns about increased violence and clashes with law enforcement due to a larger ICE presence. A "noise protest" the night before in Minneapolis led to 29 arrests, with some participants damaging hotel windows and injuring a police officer. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the violence while praising peaceful protesters. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the First Amendment protects peaceful assembly, not rioting or destruction. The fatal shooting occurred shortly after DHS launched a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota. Similar protests took place in Philadelphia and Portland, Oregon, where Border Patrol agents shot and injured a man and a woman during a vehicle stop, with DHS claiming self-defense.
