## Article summary
Nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy have entered their third week, with activists reporting at least 116 deaths and 2,600 detentions amid an intensifying crackdown. The Iranian parliament speaker has warned that U.S. troops and Israel would face retaliation if the U.S. launches a strike against Iran. President Donald Trump has expressed support for the protesters, hinting at possible military action, while the State Department issued a stern warning against "playing games" with the President. Despite an internet blackout and cut phone lines, online videos suggest ongoing demonstrations in Tehran and Mashhad, with protesters employing tactics like waving mobile phones and banging metal. The protests initially began over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency but have evolved into direct challenges to the country's theocratic government. Iranian state television has countered by airing footage of calm areas and pro-government demonstrations, while also accusing some protesters of violence. Exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi has called for continued street protests, urging demonstrators to use pre-revolution symbols. The U.S. military has stated it is prepared to defend its interests in the region, and Israel is closely monitoring the escalating tensions.
