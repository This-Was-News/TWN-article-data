Bob Weir, a founding member and guitarist of the iconic rock band the Grateful Dead, has passed away at the age of 78. His family announced that he died from underlying lung issues after recently overcoming cancer. Weir was instrumental in shaping the Grateful Dead's unique sound, known for his distinctive rhythm guitar playing and emotive singing, which complemented Jerry Garcia's lead guitar work. He co-wrote many of the band's memorable songs, contributing to a musical legacy that influenced generations of musicians and cultivated a devoted fanbase.

He was a "compulsive music maker," continuously exploring new iterations of the Grateful Dead's catalog, even collaborating with symphony orchestras. Weir viewed his songs as "living critters" and believed his music came from "another world." He often reflected on his legacy, viewing death as a potential "reward for a life well-lived."
