## Article summary
Congress is currently debating the repercussions for ICE and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem following the killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer in Minnesota. This incident has sparked nationwide protests and intensified political debate, with Democrats calling for investigations, policy changes, and even defunding ICE, while some Republicans, including President Trump and Secretary Noem, maintain the officer acted in self-defense. The killing, which occurred after Good dropped her child off at school, is the latest in a series of fatal encounters involving federal immigration agents. Democrats, led by figures like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Maxwell Frost, are leveraging this event to push for greater accountability and restraint in the administration's aggressive deportation tactics. Some are even calling for Noem's impeachment, though this is unlikely given Republican control of Congress. Senator Chris Murphy plans to introduce legislation to limit federal agents' authority. The debate is unfolding as Congress negotiates funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Republicans, while expressing some concern, largely defend the administration's policies and blame the victim for the incident. The killing has brought renewed attention to similar past shootings, with some suggesting that the victim's status as a white U.S. citizen may be making the situation more visible to the public and lawmakers. The broader immigration debate continues to divide Congress, with Republicans adhering to Trump's hard-line stance and Democrats grappling with varying approaches to immigration policy.
