## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in two significant cases that could impact the energy industry and consumer costs. The first case, Plaquemines Parish v. Chevron, involves whether Chevron can move a lawsuit to federal court concerning alleged violations of oil and gas production permits dating back to World War II. Plaquemines Parish won a $744.6 million verdict against Chevron, arguing that oil and gas companies are responsible for coastal land loss. Energy advocates warn that a ruling in favor of the parish could be devastating for American energy companies and consumers, potentially acting as a tax on energy. The second case, Suncor Energy v. Boulder County Commissioners, questions whether state and local governments can file public nuisance lawsuits against oil and gas companies for global climate change effects. Industry insiders argue that such lawsuits are an attempt to use local legal avenues to control global climate policy and rewrite federal energy law. These cases are part of a broader trend of litigation against energy companies, including wrongful death lawsuits and plastic bans, which some believe are politically motivated. The financial implications of these cases are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. Concerns are also raised that increased litigation and the push for climate-friendly regulations lead to less effective products and higher consumer prices as companies settle lawsuits to avoid expensive court proceedings.
