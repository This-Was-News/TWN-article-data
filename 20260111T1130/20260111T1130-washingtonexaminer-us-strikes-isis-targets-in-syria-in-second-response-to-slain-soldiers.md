## Article summary
The United States has conducted significant strikes against multiple ISIS targets across Syria as part of Operation Hawkeye Strike. This operation began in mid-December following the killing of three Americans by an ISIS-affiliated gunman in Palmyra, Syria. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces, in collaboration with partner forces, executed these large-scale strikes to target ISIS throughout Syria, aiming to eradicate Islamic terrorism, prevent future attacks, and safeguard American and partner forces. War Secretary Pete Hegseth affirmed the U.S.'s unwavering commitment to pursuing terrorists. The recent military operation reportedly involved over 90 precision munitions and more than two dozen aircraft, hitting over 35 targets. This marks the second U.S. mission against ISIS since the December deaths. Following President Donald Trump's pledge for retaliation, the U.S. launched substantial airstrikes on December 19th, hitting numerous ISIS targets in central Syria.
