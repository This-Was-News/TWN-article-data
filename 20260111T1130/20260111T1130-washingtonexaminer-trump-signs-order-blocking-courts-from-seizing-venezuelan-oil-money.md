## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to prevent courts and creditors from seizing Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts. The order, named "Safeguarding Venezuelan Oil Revenue for the Good of the American and Venezuelan People," asserts that the oil money belongs to the Venezuelan government, not private entities like energy companies. Trump declared a national emergency, citing the potential seizure as a threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy. This action follows the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro and aims to support the rebuilding of Venezuela's energy sector. Trump met with CEOs from major oil companies, including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and ConocoPhillips, promising them security and direct government dealings if they invest in Venezuela. While the executives were receptive, they expressed skepticism about Trump's proposed timeline for immediate oil production increases. The order signifies a significant move in U.S. foreign policy regarding Venezuela's energy resources.
