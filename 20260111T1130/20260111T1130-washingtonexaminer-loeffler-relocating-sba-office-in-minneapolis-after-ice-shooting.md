## Article summary
Small Business Administration Administrator Kelly Loeffler is relocating the agency's Minneapolis office following a fatal shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. The move comes in response to what Loeffler described as "overwhelming local hostility toward ICE" after one of its officers shot and killed Renee Good. Good died when she allegedly refused to exit her vehicle and appeared to hit the officer with her car. Loeffler stated that the SBA will not allocate resources to communities that do not support the administration's efforts to deport and detain undocumented immigrants. The SBA office will be moved to a city that adheres to federal law and prioritizes public safety. This decision is the latest action by the Trump administration in Minnesota, a state that has been a focal point of controversy. Previous federal investigations into fraud, particularly within the Somali community, led to indictments and the suspension of SBA grants to the state. The recent killing of Good by ICE, which the agency claims was an act of self-defense as Good used her vehicle as a weapon, has intensified tensions between state officials and the administration.
