## Article summary
The Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has removed wall text that mentioned President Trump's two impeachments. This change occurred as the museum replaced a portrait of him in its Americas Presidents exhibition. The removed text had described his political accomplishments alongside his impeachments for abuse of power and incitement of insurrection. This specific sentence had been a point of contention for the Trump administration, which had previously listed it as evidence of bias. The White House had expressed grievances about the museum's director, Kim Sajet, over perceived partisanship. A new, black-and-white portrait of Trump has been installed, showing him in the Oval Office. The museum stated it is exploring simpler labels for new exhibitions, providing only basic information like the artist's name. However, it affirmed that the history of presidential impeachments is still represented in its museums. The Smithsonian Institution has faced pressure from the Trump administration to present a more positive view of America, including an executive order scrutinizing museum ideology. The institution is also facing an ultimatum regarding the handover of requested documents or potential budget cuts. Previously, another Smithsonian museum also altered language describing Trump's impeachments in an exhibition.
