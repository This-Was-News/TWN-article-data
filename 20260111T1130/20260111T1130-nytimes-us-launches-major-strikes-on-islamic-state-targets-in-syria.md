## Article summary
The United States conducted significant airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS) targets in Syria on Saturday, following up on larger retaliatory attacks in December. These strikes, involving F-15Es, A-10s, AC-130J gunships, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and Jordanian F-16s, targeted over 35 locations, including weapons caches and supply routes. The operation aimed to eradicate Islamic terrorism, prevent future attacks, and protect American and partner forces. The December strikes were a response to the deaths of two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter killed in a terrorist attack in Syria. These soldiers were the first American military casualties since the fall of dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2024. U.S. troops, alongside Syrian government forces and the Jordanian military, have intensified efforts to dismantle ISIS remnants. Intelligence officials warned that ISIS could exploit the post-Assad environment to free thousands of fighters and family members from detention. Despite losing territory, ISIS continues to spread its ideology through cells, affiliates, and online, having been behind major attacks in Iran, Russia, and Pakistan in 2024. The recent attacks underscore the challenges for the new Syrian government in navigating a post-civil war landscape. The Pentagon's Central Command reported that ISIS has inspired at least 11 plots against U.S. targets in the past year, and recent operations have led to the detention of 119 insurgents and the killing of 14 others.
