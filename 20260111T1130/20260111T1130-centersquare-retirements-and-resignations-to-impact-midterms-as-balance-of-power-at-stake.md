## Article summary
Several prominent politicians are stepping down or not seeking reelection, which could significantly alter the balance of power in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Notable figures like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have ended their campaigns or resigned, citing scandals and party infighting. In North Carolina, former Gov. Roy Cooper is now running for the U.S. Senate against a Trump-endorsed candidate, a race that has become a focal point due to the open seat. U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik suspended her New York gubernatorial campaign, with Donald Trump expressing concerns about her seat in the House. Trump has endorsed Bruce Blakeman for New York governor, highlighting his policy priorities. The retirement of long-serving members of Congress, including Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Steny Hoyer, and Jerrold Nadler, creates numerous open positions across the country. These shifts and candidacies suggest a dynamic and potentially unpredictable election cycle as voters decide the future political landscape.
