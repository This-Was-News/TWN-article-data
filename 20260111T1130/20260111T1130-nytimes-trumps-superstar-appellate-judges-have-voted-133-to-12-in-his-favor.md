## Article summary
President Trump's appointed appellate judges have shown a strong bias in his favor, voting 133 to 12 in support of his administration's policies. This analysis, based on a review of their 2025 records, reveals that these "Trump judges" have consistently reversed lower court rulings that hindered his agenda. While Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has stated that there are no "Obama judges or Trump judges," the data suggests otherwise, with Trump appointees supporting his policies 92% of the time. This level of support far exceeds that given to previous Republican presidents' agendas by their appointees and even Trump's own district court nominees. The overwhelming favor shown by these appellate judges has been crucial in advancing his expansive executive actions, which often faced pushback from district court judges. Experts express concern over this uniformity, noting that impartial judges would not consistently rule for one party. Examples of their favorable rulings include allowing the deployment of the National Guard in cities and the withholding of federal funds from school districts. Several factors may contribute to this phenomenon, including changes in the judicial confirmation process, Trump's nomination of judges aligned with a maximalist view of presidential power, and his active role in shaping judicial behavior through public praise and criticism. The impact of these "superstar judges," as they've been called, is expected to resonate for decades due to their lifetime appointments and the significant number appointed by Trump.
