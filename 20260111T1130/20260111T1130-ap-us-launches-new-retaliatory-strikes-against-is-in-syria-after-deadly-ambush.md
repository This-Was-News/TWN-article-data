## Article summary
The U.S. has launched new retaliatory strikes in Syria targeting the Islamic State group following a deadly ambush that resulted in the deaths of two U.S. soldiers and an American civilian interpreter last month. These large-scale strikes, conducted with partner forces, occurred around 12:30 p.m. ET on Saturday and hit multiple IS targets across Syria. The Jordanian military confirmed its participation in the operation, dubbed Operation Hawkeye Strike by the Trump administration. This response is a direct reaction to the attack in Palmyra that claimed the lives of Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat. U.S. Central Command issued a strong message, stating that those who harm American service members will be hunted down and killed. The previous day, Syrian officials reported the arrest of the military leader of IS operations in the Levant. The strikes on Saturday were carried out alongside partner forces, with the U.S. military not specifying which groups were involved, though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have historically been a key partner. Recent shifts in U.S. coordination in Syria have involved increasing collaboration with the central government in Damascus since late 2024, especially as Syria recently joined the global coalition against IS.
