## Article summary
The FDA has approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, developed by Evita Solutions. This approval has sparked criticism from anti-abortion groups and conservative politicians, including Sen. Josh Hawley and Students for Life Action, who blame the Trump administration and the FDA. The FDA stated that it has limited discretion in approving generic drugs and does not endorse any product. Despite pressure from abortion opponents, the FDA has repeatedly deemed mifepristone safe and effective. The approval process for generic drugs is typically routine, with multiple versions approved after the original patent expires. Evita Solutions filed its application four years ago, and the company aims to provide affordable and accessible abortion care. The approval of a second generic is unlikely to significantly affect access to the pill, which is often used with misoprostol for medication abortions. Access to mifepristone is restricted in many states due to laws banning or limiting abortion, though these restrictions are not supported by major medical societies. The FDA's decision aligns with its standard procedures and the expertise of its career scientists.
