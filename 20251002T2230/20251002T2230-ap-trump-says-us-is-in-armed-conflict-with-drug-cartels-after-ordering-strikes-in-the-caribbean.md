## Article summary
President Donald Trump has declared drug cartels as unlawful combatants, stating the U.S. is in an armed conflict with them. A memo obtained by The Associated Press outlines this stance, following recent U.S. strikes on boats in the Caribbean accused of drug trafficking. The memo asserts that drug trafficking into the U.S. constitutes armed conflict, justifying military action. Trump directed the Pentagon to conduct operations against these designated terrorist organizations. The memo raises questions about the extent of presidential war powers and Congress's role in authorizing military actions. The U.S. military recently carried out strikes on boats, some originating from Venezuela, following a buildup of maritime forces in the Caribbean. The memo references a Sept. 15 strike that destroyed a vessel and killed approximately three unlawful combatants. The White House defends Trump's actions as lawful, while lawmakers and human rights groups question their legality and the lack of congressional authorization. The Trump administration has designated several Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, justifying military action to combat drug trafficking. The memo highlights the transnational nature of these cartels and their ongoing attacks throughout the Western Hemisphere.
