## Article summary
President Trump has declared that the U.S. is in a formal armed conflict with drug cartels, labeling them terrorist organizations and their suspected smugglers as unlawful combatants. This decision, communicated to Congress, aims to justify recent military strikes in the Caribbean Sea that killed 17 people. Legal experts argue that drug cartels do not meet the criteria for an armed conflict, as selling drugs differs from armed attacks. Critics, including retired military lawyer Geoffrey S. Corn, condemn the move as a legal overreach. The White House defends the actions as necessary to protect the country from drug trafficking. The administration's rationale has been criticized for conflating drug trafficking with armed attacks and for lacking congressional authorization. The notice to Congress portrays the strikes as part of an ongoing conflict rather than isolated self-defense actions. Senator Jack Reed and other critics accuse Trump of waging secret wars without proper justification or transparency. Despite skepticism, the Pentagon claims compliance with domestic and international law. The administration's legal justification for targeting drug cartels remains contentious and unclear.
