## Article summary
An online fundraiser for the family of Thomas Jake Sanford, who attacked a Michigan church and set it ablaze, has raised over $275,000. Sanford, 40, drove his truck into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel, killing four and injuring eight before being shot by police. Dave Butler, a Utah resident and lifelong member of the church, started the fundraiser on GiveSendGo, aiming to raise $10,000 to support Sanford's family. The fundraiser gained significant attention and donations, with over 7,000 people contributing within 48 hours. Many donors expressed their faith's principles of forgiveness and support. Sanford's family expressed sorrow for the victims. Butler highlighted the faith's teachings of caring for others and forgiveness. Lisa Louis, whose father was killed in the attack, forgave Sanford immediately. Butler believes the fundraiser and messages of support can contribute to the healing process.
