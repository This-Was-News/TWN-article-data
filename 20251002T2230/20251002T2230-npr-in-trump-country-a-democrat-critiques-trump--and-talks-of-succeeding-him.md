## Article summary
Andy Beshear, a Democrat, has won election as governor of Kentucky twice, a state that has voted for Donald Trump three times. He is now considering a run for president and discussed Democratic strategies in an NPR interview. Beshear's success is notable as he won in a deeply red state, a feat other potential Democratic candidates lack. He criticized Trump's handling of federal employees and his address to military leaders, while acknowledging some bipartisan willingness among Kentucky voters. Beshear vetoed a bill restricting care for transgender youth, citing his faith and respect for voters. He argued that Democrats need to invest in rural and red-state areas to regain support. The interview highlighted his handling of the pandemic and natural disasters, as well as his stance on Obamacare subsidies. Beshear believes Democrats must focus on common sense and common ground issues to win back voters.
