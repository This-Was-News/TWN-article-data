## Article summary
The National Guard has been deployed to several U.S. cities as part of President Trump's anti-crime initiative, with a focus on Democratic-led cities like Washington, D.C., Memphis, and Portland. While their presence may deter crime, experts caution about long-term costs and potential resentment due to their military identity and unrequested presence. Research suggests that a visible uniformed presence can reduce crime, but it's unclear if the Guard's deployment follows evidence-based 'hot spot' strategies. Criminologists emphasize the importance of data-driven policing to maximize deterrence. The federal government has not confirmed whether such methods are guiding the Guard's deployment. Despite nationwide crime rates falling, violent crime in cities like Washington and Memphis remains high. President Trump's recent comments about using 'dangerous cities' as military training grounds have raised further uncertainties. In Oregon, state legislators have sought clarification on these plans. Short-term results in Washington, D.C., show a drop in crime, particularly murder rates. However, experts warn of potential unintended consequences, such as eroded trust between local police and communities, after federal interventions.
