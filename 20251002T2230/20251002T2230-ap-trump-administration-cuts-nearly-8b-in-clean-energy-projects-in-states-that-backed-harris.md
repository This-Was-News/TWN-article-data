## Article summary
The Trump administration has canceled $7.6 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the previous presidential election. The projects, totaling 223, were deemed not to advance national energy needs or be economically viable. The cuts affect various initiatives, including battery plants, hydrogen technology, and carbon-capture efforts. The targeted states include California, Colorado, and New York, among others. The administration has not explained the selection criteria but noted that all targeted states supported Harris and their senators voted against a Republican funding bill. The cuts include significant funding for hydrogen projects in California and the Pacific Northwest. Critics, including Senator Patty Murray and Governor Gavin Newsom, have condemned the move as politically motivated and harmful to jobs and energy costs. The Energy Department has reviewed billions in grants awarded by the Biden administration and has given recipients 30 days to appeal the termination decisions. The Trump administration has been targeting climate programs and clean energy grants, proposing to roll back emission rules and rescinding $13 billion in previous cuts.
