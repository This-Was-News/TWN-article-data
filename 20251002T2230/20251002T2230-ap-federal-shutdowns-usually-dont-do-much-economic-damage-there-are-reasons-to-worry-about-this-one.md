## Article summary
The article discusses the potential economic impact of the U.S. federal government shutdown that began on Wednesday. While past shutdowns have had minimal economic damage, this one is considered riskier due to President Donald Trump's threats to permanently eliminate thousands of government jobs and the already precarious state of the economy. Financial markets are currently unfazed, assuming a resolution similar to past shutdowns. However, the political divide between Republicans and Democrats raises concerns. The shutdown could affect about 750,000 federal employees, and Trump's threat of mass firings could have longer-term consequences. The economic costs are normally minimal unless the shutdown lasts for several weeks. The shutdown coincides with a strained job market and uncertainty around Trump's trade policies. The September jobs report has been delayed indefinitely due to the shutdown. The economy is showing mixed signals, with strong GDP growth in the second quarter but slower job creation. The overall economic situation is described as precarious and uncertain.
