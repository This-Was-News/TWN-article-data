## Article summary
An immigration judge in Baltimore rejected Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia's request for asylum in the United States. This decision closed one avenue his lawyers had pursued to keep him in the country, but a final removal order from 2019 remains in place. The Trump administration cannot deport him again until a separate federal case in Maryland is resolved. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a 2019 ruling that barred his removal to that country due to safety concerns. He was later brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges of immigrant smuggling. The administration has proposed deporting him to Uganda or Eswatini, but these plans have been blocked by a federal judge. A hearing is scheduled to determine the legality of the deportation process. Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia is also fighting criminal charges in Nashville related to immigrant smuggling. His lawyers have argued that the prosecution is vindictive. The Justice Department has requested a delay in the case due to the government shutdown.
