## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has proposed significant changes to military policies, aiming for a tougher and more disciplined force. His vision includes banning beards, emphasizing physical fitness, and protecting aggressive leaders. However, veteran officers criticize these changes, arguing they are disconnected from reality and could undermine military readiness. Hegseth's '1990 rule' suggests scrutinizing changes made in the last 35 years, a time when women were excluded from combat roles. His directive that all combat troops meet the highest male standard has raised eyebrows, as women already meet the same physical standards as men. Hegseth's plan to exclude troops with beards from deployment has drawn criticism, particularly from Sikh, Muslim, and Jewish service members who wear beards for religious reasons. Some of Hegseth's points, such as reviewing unnecessary training programs, resonate with many in uniform. However, his plans to allow more aggressive drill instructors and punish unfounded complaints have been met with concern. Many of the regulations Hegseth is rolling back were implemented to address issues like harassment and discrimination, which were prevalent in the 1990s. Veterans argue that reverting to 1990s policies would hinder progress and diversity in the military.
