## Article summary
The article discusses how sleeping in awkward positions can lead to morning aches and pains. Nurse practitioner Ellen Wermter explains that improper support during sleep causes muscle tension and inflammation. To prevent this, it's advised to sleep in a position that follows the natural curvature of the spine, maintaining a straight line from head to tailbone. Back sleepers should use a medium-firm pillow, while side sleepers need a pillow that supports the head without pushing it up. Stomach sleepers might need to avoid pillows or use low-loft options. Additional support can be added with smaller pillows or rolled blankets to fill gaps between the body and mattress. Regularly replacing pillows and mattresses is also recommended. If pain persists, consulting a medical professional is advised, along with basic pain relief remedies like medication, massage, and gentle stretches.
