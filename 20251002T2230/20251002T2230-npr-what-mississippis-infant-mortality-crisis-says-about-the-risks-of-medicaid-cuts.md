## Article summary
Mississippi is facing a severe infant mortality crisis, with nearly 10 babies dying per 1,000 live births, and the rate even higher for Black babies. Dr. Daniel Edney, the state's public health officer, declared a public health emergency due to these alarming rates. The crisis is attributed to various factors, including preterm births and lack of access to healthcare. Many women in Mississippi struggle to find prenatal care, with over half the counties considered maternity care deserts. Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an obstetrician in the Mississippi Delta, sees many patients with untreated chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. The state is working to improve access to care through telehealth and other initiatives. However, lack of insurance remains a significant barrier. Medicaid expansion, resisted by Governor Tate Reeves, could help more low-income women gain access to care. Nationally, infant mortality rates are also concerning, with experts warning that cuts to Medicaid could worsen the situation. The crisis highlights the urgent need for better maternal healthcare and access to insurance.
