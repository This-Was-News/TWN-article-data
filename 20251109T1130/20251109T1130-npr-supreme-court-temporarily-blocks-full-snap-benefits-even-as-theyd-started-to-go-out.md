## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked full SNAP food benefits amidst a government shutdown, despite some states having already issued them. This decision came as the Trump administration appealed a lower court's order to fully fund November's food aid for millions. The Supreme Court's action allows a lower court more time to consider a lasting pause on the benefits. The situation has caused confusion, as states began distributing full benefits after a district judge's order, only to be told to revert to partial payments. Funding for SNAP, which serves nearly 42 million people, ran out a week prior due to the shutdown. A district judge had criticized the administration's decision to issue only partial payments, citing the potential for "needless suffering" and suggesting political motivations. The administration argued it lacked sufficient emergency funds and that Congress should provide more funding, warning that shifting money would harm other nutrition programs. Before the Supreme Court's intervention, some states had already started issuing full benefits, with the money appearing on EBT cards. The appeals court is expected to issue a decision on the stay request as soon as possible.
