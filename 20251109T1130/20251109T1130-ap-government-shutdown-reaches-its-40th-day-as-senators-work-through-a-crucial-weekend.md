## Article summary
The U.S. government shutdown has reached its 40th day, with senators engaged in weekend negotiations to end the funding dispute. The shutdown has impacted flights nationwide, threatened food assistance for millions, and left federal workers without pay. While Senate Republicans aim to reopen the government by funding parts of it through January, Democratic support is uncertain. Democrats are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are set to expire and could double premiums for many. Republicans have shown some openness to a later vote on these subsidies, but a definitive agreement remains elusive. President Trump has urged Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster to bypass Democrats. Moderate senators from both parties are discussing proposals that would fund government operations temporarily and include a promise of a future vote on healthcare subsidies. The outcome hinges on whether enough Democrats will accept a deal that reopens the government without a guaranteed extension of the ACA subsidies, facing a choice between prolonged shutdown pain and a less certain resolution. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is considering a bipartisan package that could include a test vote in the coming days.
