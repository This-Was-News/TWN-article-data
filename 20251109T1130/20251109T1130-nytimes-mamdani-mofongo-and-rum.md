## Article summary
Following his hard-fought mayoral election victory, Zohran Mamdani attended an annual political gathering in Puerto Rico, where former adversaries sought to mend fences. Despite a recent "civil war" between Mamdani and the New York political establishment, the post-election retreat saw politicians, lobbyists, and union representatives socializing and attempting to connect with the new mayor.  Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the State Assembly, introduced Mamdani, and labor leaders and business lobbyists who had previously opposed him now vied for private meetings. Mamdani's aides also attended a reception hosted by Jewish groups, signaling an effort to bridge divides. Governor Kathy Hochul, while hosting Mamdani, faced chants of "tax the rich," highlighting ongoing policy disagreements, particularly concerning Mamdani's proposals for new taxes on wealthy residents and corporations to fund ambitious campaign promises.  Rivalries were also evident among candidates for City Council speaker and political maneuvering was observed between allies and non-allies of Mamdani. Amidst the socializing, Mamdani emphasized unity, stating, "Together in this room and on this stage, I feel something that is all too rare in our politics, A united front." However, underlying political tensions, such as Hochul's resistance to tax increases and potential conflicts over Mamdani's progressive agenda, remain.  Lobbyists were actively seeking information about Mamdani's inner circle, including his top adviser Elle Bisgaard-Church and counsel Ali Najmi, as potential appointees were also observed networking. While some, like John Samuelsen of the Transport Workers Union, urged full support for Mamdani's vision, others expressed frustration that the celebratory atmosphere overshadowed substantive policy discussions about funding his promises. Mamdani himself appeared ready for a break after the intense campaign.
