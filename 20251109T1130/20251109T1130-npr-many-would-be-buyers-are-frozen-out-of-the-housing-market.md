## Article summary
High prices and mortgage rates are preventing many potential buyers from entering the housing market, leading to a record low share of homes sold to first-time buyers. The average age of a first-time homebuyer has risen to 40, an all-time high, prompting the National Association of Realtors to update its imagery to reflect this demographic shift. Currently, first-time buyers represent only about one in five homes sold, a significant decrease compared to previous generations. This situation highlights critical issues within the housing market, particularly the lack of inventory accessible to younger adults. Many aspiring homeowners, like Eve Burdick and her husband, find themselves priced out even in markets with below-average home prices, struggling to afford both the purchase and necessary renovations. The problem is exacerbated by existing homeowners, who have lower mortgage rates and are staying in their homes longer, averaging 11 years, which further restricts the supply of available properties. Compounding these challenges are the rising costs of other necessities, making it difficult for first-time buyers to save for a down payment, while many are also burdened by debts such as student loans and medical expenses. Sasha Skelton and her partner, both in their mid-30s with full-time jobs, have also paused their home search due to high prices and economic uncertainty, despite a desire to settle down. The current market conditions are making the dream of homeownership increasingly unattainable for a growing number of people.
