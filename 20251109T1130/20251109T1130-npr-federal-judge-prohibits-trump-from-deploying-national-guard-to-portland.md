## Article summary
A federal judge has permanently blocked President Donald Trump from deploying the National Guard to Portland, ruling that the situation did not legally warrant such an action. U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut stated that while violent protests occurred, law enforcement was capable of managing them, and subsequent demonstrations have been largely peaceful. The ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to deploy National Guard members to the city, marking the fourth time the judge has blocked such a deployment. Portland, Oregon, and the state of California had sued, arguing the executive branch exceeded its constitutional authority and that local law enforcement could handle the conditions. The Department of Justice contended that the president has broad authority to deploy the National Guard to protect federal functions, citing arrests and disruptions. The White House indicated an expectation to be vindicated by a higher court. This case is significant as it is the first to go to trial regarding the lawfulness of federalizing the National Guard under Trump's presidency. Judge Immergut clarified that her ruling does not preclude future deployments if conditions genuinely justify intervention. Legal experts anticipate an appeal, and political leaders have hailed the decision as a check on presidential power. The judge also expressed concern over the administration's actions regarding previous temporary restraining orders, questioning the timeline of troop movements.
