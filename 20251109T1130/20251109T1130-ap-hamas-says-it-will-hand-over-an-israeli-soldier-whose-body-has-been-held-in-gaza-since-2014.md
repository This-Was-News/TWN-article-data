## Article summary
Hamas has announced that it will hand over the body of Israeli soldier Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014 and whose remains have been held in Gaza since then. This development marks a significant step in the U.S.-brokered truce and brings closure to an 11-year wait for Goldin's parents. Hamas stated that Goldin's body was discovered in a tunnel in Rafah. Goldin was killed shortly after a ceasefire took effect in 2014, ending the war between Israel and Hamas that year. Reports suggest Hamas may have delayed the release to negotiate for militants trapped in Rafah, but an Israeli minister denied any such deal. Goldin is one of five deceased hostages whose remains are still in Gaza, with the militants expected to return all of them as part of the truce. Israeli President Isaac Herzog confirmed the expected release. Since the ceasefire began, militants have returned the remains of 23 hostages, with Israel releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians for each Israeli hostage returned. The ongoing conflict has resulted in a high Palestinian death toll, with Gaza's Health Ministry reporting over 69,000 fatalities. The Israeli military had previously determined Goldin's death based on evidence found at the site.
