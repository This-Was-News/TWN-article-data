## Article summary
A speeding car, initially spotted street racing and driving recklessly on a freeway, crashed into a crowded bar in Tampa, Florida's historic Ybor City district early Saturday morning. The vehicle, which was fleeing police, slammed into Bradleys on 7th, a bar known for its nightlife and tourists. The incident resulted in four fatalities and 11 injuries. Three people died at the scene, and a fourth succumbed to their injuries at a hospital. As of Saturday afternoon, two individuals remained in critical condition, while others were stable or had been treated and discharged. Police identified the suspect as 22-year-old Silas Sampson, who faces charges including vehicular homicide and aggravated fleeing. The incident has prompted a strong reaction from city officials, with the mayor expressing the city's collective grief. This event occurs amidst a broader discussion in some states and among agencies about restricting high-speed car chases due to safety concerns, although Florida's highway patrol has recently loosened limits on such pursuits.
