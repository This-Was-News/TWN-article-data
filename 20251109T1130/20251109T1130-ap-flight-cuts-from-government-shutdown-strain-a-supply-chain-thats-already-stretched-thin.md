## Article summary
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented a 10% reduction in flight capacity at 40 major U.S. airports, a move that could strain the air cargo industry as the peak holiday season approaches. This reduction impacts airports with significant package distribution centers for companies like FedEx and UPS. Adding to the strain, UPS and FedEx have grounded their McDonnell Douglas MD-11 fleets as a precautionary measure following a fatal crash. Experts warn that these combined factors could create a "one-two punch" for cargo carriers and consumers, potentially leading to delivery delays, especially during the busiest shipping weeks in mid-December. While most air freight is international, the domestic flight reductions mean less capacity in the bellies of passenger planes, which carry a significant portion of air cargo. Shipping companies assure that they have contingency plans, especially for critical items like pharmaceuticals, and that many of their flights operate outside the restricted hours. However, the disruption highlights the fragility of the supply chain, which is already stretched thin due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. Experts suggest that consumers should order holiday gifts early to mitigate potential delays.
