## Article summary
In early 2019, a group of Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 6's Red Squadron embarked on a top-secret mission to plant an electronic device in North Korea to intercept Kim Jong-un's communications and high-level nuclear talks with President Trump. The mission, requiring the president's direct approval, aimed to provide valuable intelligence but risked detection, which could escalate tensions or lead to a hostage crisis. After months of rehearsals, the SEALs encountered a North Korean boat, opened fire, and retreated without completing their objective. The operation has never been publicly acknowledged by either the U.S. or North Korea, and details remain classified. The Trump administration did not notify key congressional members overseeing intelligence operations, potentially violating the law.
