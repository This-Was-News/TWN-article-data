## Article summary
The world's largest iceberg, A23a, is rapidly breaking apart and melting in the warmer waters of the South Atlantic Ocean. Originally calved from the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 1986, A23a has been the oldest and largest iceberg for much of its existence, surviving by getting stuck in colder waters twice. Now, at nearly 40 years old, it is shrinking and breaking into large chunks. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have been tracking its movements, noting its unusual journey, including getting stuck in a vortex called the Taylor column. Despite its dramatic path, its current demise is typical for icebergs. A23a's journey has provided valuable data for scientists, helping them understand the impact of massive icebergs on the environment. Samples taken from areas affected by A23a will offer insights into the mixing of fresh and saltwater and its effects on ocean carbon levels. This research contributes to understanding processes that control sea level rise over the long term.
