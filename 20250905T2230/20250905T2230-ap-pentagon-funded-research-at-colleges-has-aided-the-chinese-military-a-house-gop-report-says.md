## Article summary
A House GOP report reveals that Pentagon-funded research projects at U.S. colleges, in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes linked to China's defense industry, have aided the Chinese military over the past two years. The report argues that these projects, totaling 1,400 publications and funded by $2.5 billion in defense grants, have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains amid a tech and arms rivalry. Republicans warn that failing to safeguard American research could erode U.S. technological dominance and risk national defense capabilities. The report recommends scaling back U.S. research collaboration with China and supports legislation to prohibit Defense Department funding for projects affiliated with Chinese entities identified as security risks. The Chinese Embassy dismissed the report as groundless, asserting that scientific and technological cooperation benefits both countries. The report highlights cases where U.S. researchers collaborated with Chinese institutions, including one involving a geophysicist at Carnegie Science who worked with Chinese entities on Pentagon-backed research relevant to nuclear weapons development. Carnegie Science disputed the report's claims, stating the research was fundamental and unclassified. The report also criticizes Defense Department policies for not explicitly forbidding collaborations with blacklisted foreign institutions and recommends banning such partnerships. House investigators emphasize the need to protect federally funded research from foreign infiltration while not seeking to end all academic collaborations with China.
