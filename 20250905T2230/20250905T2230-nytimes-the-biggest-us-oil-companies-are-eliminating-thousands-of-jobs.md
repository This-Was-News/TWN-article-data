## Article summary
ConocoPhillips, a major U.S. oil company, announced plans to reduce its global workforce by up to 25%, affecting around 3,250 employees, primarily this year. This decision comes amid persistently moderate oil prices, which have pressured the company's profits, falling 15% year-over-year to $2 billion in the second quarter. The layoffs follow a trend among large oil companies, including Chevron, which also announced significant workforce reductions. These cuts reflect the industry's response to lower oil prices, currently around $64 a barrel, which, while sufficient for drilling, are lower than recent highs. The layoffs also follow a period of industry consolidation, including ConocoPhillips' $17 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil. Despite these cuts, the overall employment in the oil and gas sector has seen only a slight decline, with pipeline construction jobs actually growing. Over a longer period, however, the U.S. oil and gas industry has been shrinking even as production hits record highs. ConocoPhillips' stock price dropped over 4% on the announcement.
