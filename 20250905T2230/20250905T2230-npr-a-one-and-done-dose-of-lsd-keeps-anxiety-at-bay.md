## Article summary
A new study finds that a single dose of LSD can significantly ease generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a debilitating form of anxiety affecting about 1 in 10 people annually. The study involved 198 adults with GAD, showing that higher doses of LSD (100 or 200 micrograms) led to quick and sustained improvements for up to 12 weeks. Lower doses had no better effect than a placebo. Dr. David Feifel, one of the researchers, noted immediate improvements in participants. However, the role of non-drug factors like the sensory environment remains unclear. Successful psychedelic treatment often depends on the right mindset and environment, according to experts like Robin Carhart-Harris. The study used MM120, a proprietary form of LSD, which differs from typical antidepressants by inducing a psychedelic experience. The FDA has given MM120 'breakthrough therapy' status, and further Phase 3 trials are expected to conclude in 2026. This research is part of a growing trend in psychedelic studies aimed at revolutionizing mental health treatments.
