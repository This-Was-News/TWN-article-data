## Article summary
An Associated Press investigation into an Israeli attack on a Gaza hospital that killed 22 people, including five journalists, raises serious questions about Israel's rationale and execution of the strikes. The attack targeted a known journalists' gathering point, with Israel claiming a camera on the roof was used by Hamas to observe troops. New evidence suggests the camera belonged to a Reuters video journalist, Hussam al-Masr, who routinely covered his equipment with a white cloth to protect it from the sun and dust. Witnesses reported that Israeli forces observed the position by drone before the attack, providing an opportunity to correctly identify al-Masr. The investigation also revealed troubling decisions, including a second strike on the same position after medical and emergency workers arrived, and the use of high-explosive tank shells instead of more precise guided weapons. Israel struck the hospital four times without warning, and the military has not commented on whether they targeted the wrong person. The attack has sparked global anger and accusations of a double-tap strategy, which experts say could be a war crime. Israel has killed 189 Palestinian reporters in Gaza and barred foreign journalists from entering since the war began in October 2023. The AP's analysis is based on information from current and former Israeli military officials, other officials, weapons analysts, and accounts from nearly 20 people who were at or near the hospital during the strikes.
