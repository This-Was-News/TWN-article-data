## Article summary
Anthropic, an AI company, has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who claimed the company used pirated copies of their books to train its chatbot, Claude. The settlement, if approved, will pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 affected books, marking the largest copyright recovery ever. The lawsuit was initiated by authors including thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson. A federal judge previously ruled that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books was not illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites. The settlement also requires Anthropic to destroy the original book files it downloaded. The Authors Guild praised the settlement, while the Danish Rights Alliance noted it would offer little help to European writers and publishers. The settlement is likely to influence other disputes, including ongoing lawsuits against OpenAI and Microsoft. Anthropic, valued at $183 billion, expects to make $5 billion in sales this year but has not reported making a profit.
