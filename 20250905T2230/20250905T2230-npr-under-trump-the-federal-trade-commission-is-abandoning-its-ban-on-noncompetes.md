## Article summary
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under President Trump is abandoning its ban on noncompete agreements, reversing a significant rule implemented during the Biden administration. Noncompetes are contracts that restrict workers from taking jobs with competitors or starting their own businesses. The ban, championed by former FTC chair Lina Khan, was finalized in 2024 but never took effect due to legal challenges. A federal judge in Texas halted the ban, and the Trump administration later paused the appeal, leading to the FTC's decision to dismiss the appeal and vacate the rule. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson and Commissioner Melissa Holyoak argued that the rule was legally flawed, while Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter dissented, emphasizing the need for worker protection. The FTC estimates that 30 million Americans are bound by noncompetes, which Khan claimed could lead to increased wages and new businesses. Business groups opposed the ban, arguing it would harm competition and economic stability. Ferguson has expressed concerns about noncompetes but prefers targeted enforcement over a blanket ban. The FTC has since taken action against specific companies enforcing noncompetes, though critics argue this approach is insufficient. Rebecca Denton, a real estate worker, shared her experience with a noncompete agreement, highlighting the challenges workers face. Colorado's law limiting noncompetes has provided some relief, but advocates argue for a nationwide ban to truly protect workers.
