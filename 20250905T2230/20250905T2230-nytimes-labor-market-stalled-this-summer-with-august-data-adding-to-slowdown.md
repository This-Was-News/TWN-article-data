## Article summary
The labor market in the U.S. has shown signs of slowing down this summer, with August data indicating a significant slowdown. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, far below expectations, and the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.3%. The economy has been cooling since the pandemic peak, affected by high interest rates, tariffs, and disruptive actions by the Trump administration. Job growth for the early summer was revised down, showing a loss of jobs in June. The labor market's weakness poses risks for President Trump, whose approval ratings on the economy have been declining. The Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates, but inflation concerns remain due to recent tariffs. The health care sector is one of the few areas still hiring significantly, but even that growth is slowing. Other industries, such as manufacturing, have seen job losses. The Trump administration's policies on immigration and tariffs are also affecting hiring and production costs. Despite the challenges, most forecasters do not expect a full-blown recession, with some economic support expected from recent tax cuts.
