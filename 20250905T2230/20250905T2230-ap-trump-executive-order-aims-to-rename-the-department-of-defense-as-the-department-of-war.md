## Article summary
President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to rebrand the Department of Defense as the Department of War, signaling strength and victory. The change, which requires congressional approval, has already seen cosmetic shifts like updating the Pentagon's website to war.gov. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, now referred to as the secretary of war, emphasized a shift to offensive strategies. The move aligns with Trump's broader efforts to reshape the military, including renaming bases and banning transgender soldiers. Trump insists his tough stance supports his diplomatic efforts, citing conflicts he claims to have resolved. The Department of War originally existed from 1789 until it was renamed in 1947. Trump and Hegseth have been pushing for this change, arguing that the U.S. hasn't won major wars since the name was changed. They have also been involved in other name changes at the Pentagon, sometimes bypassing legal requirements. Republicans in Congress have criticized these actions, particularly the attempt to restore Confederate-related base names.
