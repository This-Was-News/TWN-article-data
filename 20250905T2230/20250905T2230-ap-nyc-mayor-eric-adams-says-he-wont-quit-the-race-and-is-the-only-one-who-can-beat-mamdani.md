## Article summary
New York City Mayor Eric Adams has reiterated his commitment to staying in the mayoral race, asserting that he is the only candidate who can defeat Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Adams made this statement during a hastily called news conference, emphasizing his determination to continue despite reports suggesting he might leave the race for a potential federal job in the Trump administration. He criticized Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, calling them 'spoiled brats' and highlighting his own working-class background. President Donald Trump has expressed a preference for Adams or Cuomo to challenge Mamdani directly, believing a one-on-one contest would be more winnable. Adams recently met with Steve Whtkoff, a Trump envoy, though the specifics of their discussion remain unclear. Former Governor David Paterson, who endorses Adams, revealed that Adams mentioned receiving offers but expressed a strong desire to stay in the race. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, remains the favorite to win the upcoming election, focusing on affordability issues created by Cuomo and exacerbated by Adams.
