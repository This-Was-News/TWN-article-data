## Article summary
The U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing down, with job growth significantly decreasing. In August, employers added only 22,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Job growth has been anemic for four consecutive months, with an average decrease of 75% compared to the same period last year. Weakness is evident across various sectors, including manufacturing, construction, and oil drilling. Health care jobs saw a modest increase, but this was offset by continued cuts in the federal workforce, which has lost 97,000 jobs since the beginning of the year. The weak job report follows the recent dismissal of the Labor Department official overseeing employment data. Additionally, for the first time in over four years, there are more people looking for work than there are job openings. This economic slowdown is likely to prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at its upcoming meeting.
