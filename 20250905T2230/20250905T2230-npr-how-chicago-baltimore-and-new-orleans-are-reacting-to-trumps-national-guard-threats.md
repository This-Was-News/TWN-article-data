## Article summary
President Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, despite a federal judge ruling against his use of troops in Los Angeles. In Chicago, Governor J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have opposed the deployment, citing a decline in crime and legal concerns. Pritzker accused Trump of seeking political drama, while Johnson called the move illegal and costly. In Baltimore, Mayor Brandon Scott also rejected Trump's threats, highlighting a significant reduction in crime. Meanwhile, in New Orleans, Republican Governor Jeff Landry welcomed Trump's offer, but local Democrats, including City Council Vice President Helena Moreno, criticized it as a political tactic. Preliminary data shows a 20% drop in crime in New Orleans since last August. U.S. Rep. Troy Carter urged Trump to reconsider, emphasizing the need for resources rather than military presence.
