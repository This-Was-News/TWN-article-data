## Article summary
Lines of young adults, some arriving as early as 5:30 a.m., now snake outside 2819 Church in Atlanta, where attendance has surged to around 6,000 weekly churchgoers, up from less than 200 in 2023. The church, led by pastor Philip Anthony Mitchell, features a lively worship atmosphere with Christian rap and contemporary music, followed by Mitchell's intense, unvarnished preaching style. Mitchell's sermons, which he describes as "life or death," are known for their animated delivery and direct biblical interpretation, often spreading quickly online. The nondenominational and theologically conservative church, whose name references Matthew 28:19, primarily attracts young Black adults, a demographic less likely to identify as Christian. Churchgoers are drawn to Mitchell's authenticity and his candid sharing of his past struggles, finding his messages a counterweight to what he calls "feel-good American preaching." The church's rapid growth has led to logistical challenges, including moving into its own building and adding extra services to accommodate the influx of attendees. Despite facing criticism and public scrutiny, Mitchell remains focused on his mission to bring people to faith, emphasizing spiritual maturity and the consequences of sin. The worship experience at 2819, described as having a "tangible presence" of the Holy Spirit, extends beyond Mitchell's sermons, with a strong emphasis on community through small groups called "squads" and a significant online following.
