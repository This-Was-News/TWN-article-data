## Article summary
In West Virginia, the National Guard has historically been viewed as both a patriotic duty and a vital economic resource, especially in poorer regions. However, recent events have sparked questions about the rationale behind National Guard deployments. The fatal shooting of Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and the wounding of Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, both West Virginia National Guard members, while they were on duty patrolling near the White House, have brought these concerns to the forefront. These soldiers were part of President Trump's National Guard deployments to American cities, intended to combat crime, a move that has faced legal challenges and growing criticism. Many West Virginians, even in a state that strongly supported Trump, are questioning why their National Guard members were sent to Washington D.C. for such duties. For young adults in areas with limited job prospects, the National Guard offers financial incentives for college, pay, and deployment bonuses, making it an attractive opportunity. Despite the governor's assertion of unwavering support and the voluntary nature of the deployment, concerns are being raised about the troops' actual tasks, with reports suggesting they were involved in activities like trash pickup rather than security. This has led to criticism from lawmakers and local media, highlighting the perceived political nature of the deployment and the tragic consequences it can have for soldiers and their communities.
