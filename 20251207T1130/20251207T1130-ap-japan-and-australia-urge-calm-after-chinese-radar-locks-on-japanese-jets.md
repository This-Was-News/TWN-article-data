## Article summary
Japan and Australia have urged calm following an incident where Chinese military aircraft locked radar on Japanese fighter jets near the southern island of Okinawa. Japan's Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that Japan formally protested the "extremely regrettable and dangerous" act, demanding preventive measures. The Chinese J-15 aircraft reportedly locked radar on Japanese F-15 jets on two occasions while conducting exercises. Japan maintains its jets were pursuing Chinese aircraft at a safe distance without provocation and without breaching Japanese airspace. China, however, defended its flight training, accusing Japanese aircraft of harassment and warning against "slandering and smearing." This incident occurs a month after heightened tensions stemming from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan. Takaichi called the radar lock "extremely disappointing" and vowed to conduct surveillance resolutely. Both Japan and Australia expressed deep concern, with Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles emphasizing the need for "safe and professional" interactions. The two nations agreed to bolster military ties and establish a framework for strategic defense coordination. Separately, the Philippine coast guard reported that Chinese forces fired flares toward a fisheries bureau plane in the South China Sea.
