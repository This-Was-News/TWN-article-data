## Article summary
Admiral Rachel Levine's official portrait at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was altered during a federal shutdown to display her previous name instead of her current legal name. Levine, the first transgender person to receive Senate confirmation for her role as assistant secretary for health, had her portrait displayed in the Humphrey Building hallway since 2021. A spokesperson for HHS stated that the change was made to ensure information reflects "gold standard science" and that "biological reality guides our approach to public health." Levine's representative called the act "bigotry" and "petty." An HHS staff member described the change as "disrespectful" and an example of "erasure of transgender individuals." This incident occurs in the context of a political climate where transgender rights have been a significant focus, with past anti-transgender campaigns and actions by the Trump administration impacting various federal agencies. Levine herself stated she would not comment on the "petty action" but acknowledged the honor of serving the American people. Her former colleague praised her public health contributions and urged current leadership to focus on pressing public health issues rather than such actions.
