## Article summary
Edmonton, Canada, is piloting AI-powered police body cameras capable of facial recognition, a move that has sparked significant debate and concern. This technology, which can identify individuals on a watch list of approximately 7,000 people flagged for serious offenses or warrants, is being tested by Axon Enterprise, Inc. The pilot project aims to enhance officer safety by detecting potentially dangerous individuals. However, critics, including former members of Axon's AI ethics board, argue that the technology's societal risks and privacy implications have not been adequately addressed through public debate and expert vetting. Axon's CEO states the pilot is for research to assess performance and necessary safeguards, not a product launch. Concerns about the technology's accuracy, potential bias against certain demographics, and the lack of transparency surrounding its development and deployment have been raised. While Edmonton police emphasize that matches require human review and that the technology is intended for use during investigations, civil liberties advocates and academics express apprehension about its broader implications for policing and public trust. The pilot's limited scope, testing only during daylight hours and with outputs analyzed later, is noted, but the potential expansion of such technology globally remains a significant point of contention, especially given varying international regulations and past ethical controversies surrounding Axon's products.
