## Article summary
The Abandons is a new Western series on Netflix that, despite its rugged setting, functions as a sudsy soap opera. The show introduces a large ensemble cast in its early moments, including the wealthy mining matriarch Constance (Gillian Anderson) and the struggling cattle rancher Fiona (Lena Headey), whose conflicting interests drive the central plot. The series features numerous characters and factions vying for power, but it simplifies complex narratives by having characters explicitly state their thoughts and intentions, a technique attributed to the streaming service's desire to keep viewers engaged. While it presents a visually appealing Western landscape with elements of banditry and conflict, its core is a dramatic rivalry between Constance and Fiona, filled with intrigue, betrayal, and schemes. The performances of Anderson and Headey are highlighted, portraying their characters as powerful, hard-hearted women with clear motivations rooted in greed and hatred. The narrative unfolds in a black-and-white conflict, presenting Fiona as a flawed hero and Constance as a villain. Although the season concludes on a cliffhanger, the preceding episode is praised for its carefully constructed tension and assured execution. Ultimately, The Abandons is described as an enjoyable, fun watch, provided viewers are amenable to its soapy, dramatic undertones beneath the Western facade.
