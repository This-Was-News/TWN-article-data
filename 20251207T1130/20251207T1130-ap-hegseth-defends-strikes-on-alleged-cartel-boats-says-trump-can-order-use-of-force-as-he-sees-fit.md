## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended recent strikes on alleged drug cartel boats, stating that President Donald Trump has the authority to use military force as he deems necessary to protect national interests. These strikes have resulted in over 80 deaths and are facing scrutiny for potential violations of international law. Hegseth drew a parallel between these actions and the war on terror, asserting that individuals associated with designated terrorist organizations bringing drugs into the country will be targeted. He emphasized that no nation should doubt the U.S.'s resolve to take decisive military action. The remarks were made during the Reagan National Defense Forum, where Hegseth also discussed the Trump administration's new national security strategy, which prioritizes American dominance in the Western Hemisphere and views European allies as weak. Additionally, Hegseth addressed the need to counter China's rise through strength and reiterated Trump's vow to resume nuclear testing, a goal that has concerned nuclear arms experts. He criticized post-Reagan Republican leaders for supporting unsuccessful interventions and dismissed concerns about climate change impacting military readiness, stating the "war department will not be distracted by democracy building, interventionism, undefined wars, regime change, climate change, woke moralizing and feckless nation building."
