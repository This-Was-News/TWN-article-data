## Article summary
The Trump administration has revised the National Park Service's fee-free calendar, removing Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth while adding President Trump's birthday. These changes, effective January 1, also include the 110th anniversary of the NPS, Constitution Day, and President Teddy Roosevelt's birthday. Non-U.S. residents will still be charged entrance fees, with a new "America-first pricing" policy imposing an additional $100 fee at 11 popular parks and raising the annual pass for non-residents to $250. This move aligns with a July executive order aimed at increasing fees for international visitors and providing preferential treatment to citizens and residents. The Department of the Interior has termed these new dates "patriotic fee-free days," emphasizing increased accessibility and affordability for Americans. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum stated that these policies ensure U.S. taxpayers continue to have affordable access while international visitors contribute to park maintenance. This revision follows previous administration actions to reshape the narrative of U.S. history on federal lands, including a request for visitors to flag any signage perceived negatively.
