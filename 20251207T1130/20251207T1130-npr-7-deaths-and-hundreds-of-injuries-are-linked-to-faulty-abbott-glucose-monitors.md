## Article summary
Abbott Diabetes Care has issued a warning about faulty glucose readings from some of its FreeStyle Libre 3 and FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus sensors. Internal testing revealed that a single production line caused these devices to potentially provide incorrect low glucose readings. This issue has been linked to seven deaths and hundreds of serious injuries. Approximately 3 million sensors were affected, with about 1.5 million already expired or used. Abbott advises customers to immediately stop using and dispose of any affected sensors. Undetected incorrect low glucose readings could lead to dangerous treatment decisions, such as excessive carbohydrate intake or missed insulin doses, posing serious health risks. While seven deaths were reported, all occurred outside the U.S. Of the 736 severe injuries, 57 happened in the U.S. Customers can check if their device is affected and receive a free replacement by visiting FreeStyleCheck.com. The Food and Drug Administration also provides more information on this recall.
