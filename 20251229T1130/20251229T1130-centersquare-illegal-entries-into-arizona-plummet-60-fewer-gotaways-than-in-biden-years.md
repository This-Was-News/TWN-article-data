## Article summary
Illegal border crossings and gotaways in Arizona have significantly decreased, with a reported 92% drop compared to the Biden administration. In fiscal year 2025, apprehensions in Arizona were 65,813, a stark contrast to the over 775,000 reported in fiscal year 2023, which included nearly 200,000 gotaways. Gotaways, defined as individuals who enter illegally to evade capture, are not publicly reported by CBP but were exclusively obtained by The Center Square. Many of these gotaways are known to have criminal records or have been previously deported. The Tucson and Yuma sectors in Arizona were heavily impacted during the Biden administration, with checkpoint closures in Yuma exacerbating the issue. In 2023, the Tucson Sector reported 373,625 apprehensions and at least 185,866 gotaways. Smuggling organizations employed tactics like 'task saturation' to overwhelm Border Patrol agents, allowing contraband and gotaways to pass undetected. However, under recent border security policies implemented by President Trump, Arizona Border Patrol agents, supported by the National Guard and Coast Guard, are actively processing individuals for expedited removal. The Department of Homeland Security is also expanding smart wall construction and border barrier infrastructure in Arizona, while recruitment for DHS, CBP, and Border Patrol has reached record highs.
