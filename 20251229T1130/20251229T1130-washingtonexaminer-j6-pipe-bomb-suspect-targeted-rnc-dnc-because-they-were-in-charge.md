## Article summary
The man accused of planting pipe bombs near the RNC and DNC headquarters on January 5, 2021, confessed to investigators that he targeted both parties because "they were in charge." The suspect, identified as Brian Cole Jr., stated he became bewildered by the 2020 election results and felt compelled to speak up. He initially denied planting the bombs, claiming he went to Washington D.C. to attend a protest related to the election. However, after being confronted with video evidence, Cole admitted to placing the devices, though he insisted they were unrelated to the January 6th Capitol riot or the certification of election results. Prosecutors argue that Cole poses an intolerable risk to the community and should remain detained pending his trial. A memo detailing Cole's alleged confession was unsealed, providing insight into his motivations. Cole expressed a belief that "someone needs to speak up" when federal elections are perceived as being tampered with. He also stated he "didn't agree with what people were doing" by telling half the country to ignore election concerns. Prosecutors highlighted that Cole was relieved the bombs did not detonate but wanted to act against both political parties. His detention hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.
