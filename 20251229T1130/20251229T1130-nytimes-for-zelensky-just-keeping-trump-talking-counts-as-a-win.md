## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine views even a stalemate in peace talks with President Trump as progress, especially after recent setbacks in U.S. support. A key objective for Zelensky was to prevent the negotiations from derailing, and Trump's continued engagement is seen as a win for Ukraine. Trump has stepped back from setting deadlines for a peace deal, stating his sole deadline is ending the war. Notably, Trump did not echo Russia's maximalist demands, a shift from earlier in his term, despite speaking with President Putin just before meeting Zelensky. This suggests a closer alignment between Kyiv and Washington on the peace negotiations. Zelensky expressed optimism about the progress made, though acknowledged remaining sticking points regarding Ukrainian-held land and a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant. Despite some Ukrainian concerns about Trump pressuring Zelensky into a deal on Moscow's terms, Trump refrained from echoing Kremlin demands or pressuring for a quick resolution. Zelensky reported the peace plan as 90 percent complete, with allies nearly aligned on security guarantees and a proposed compromise of a demilitarized zone. Trump adopted a more cautious tone, describing the progress as 'getting closer to an agreement' rather than finalized. A promising development is Trump's apparent willingness to host another round of talks next month, potentially including European leaders, which could strengthen Ukraine's position.
