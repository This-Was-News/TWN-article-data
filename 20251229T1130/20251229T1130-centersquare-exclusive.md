## Article summary
An analysis of migration data reveals that more Californians and Floridians are moving to Texas than vice versa. Over a 12-month period, Texas saw significant influxes from these two states, with more than double the number of Californians moving to Texas compared to Texans moving to California. Similarly, about one-third more Floridians relocated to Texas than Texans moved to Florida. The primary drivers for this migration appear to be the pursuit of opportunity, affordability, and a higher quality of life, with many new residents being Gen X and millennials. Notably, the majority of movers to Texas are leaving Democratic-led states with higher income taxes. North Texas, particularly the Dallas-Fort Worth area, is the top destination within the state. Smaller cities in North Texas are also emerging as growth hotspots. Texas counties have experienced substantial population growth, with some ranking among the top nationally for numeric and percentage growth. Conversely, states experiencing net population loss are all Democrat-led. A key factor contributing to this trend is the absence of state income tax in Texas, unlike the high-tax states from which many are departing.
