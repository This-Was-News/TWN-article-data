## Article summary
As the new year begins, housing data is taking center stage, with reports from the National Association of Realtors and the Case-Shiller Home Price Index expected to set the tone for 2026. The Zillow Housing Market Report offers a more immediate view, indicating a return to seasonal cooling in November after an unusually active fall. While newly pending home sales softened due to colder weather and holidays, they remain above year-ago levels, suggesting persistent underlying demand despite affordability constraints. National home values showed stability year-over-year in November, but this masks a more uneven market, with 53% of homes experiencing a value decline over the past year. This adjustment is attributed to higher borrowing costs, increased inventory in some areas, and buyers' reluctance to chase prices. Looking ahead to 2026, Zillow forecasts a modest 1.7% rise in home values and a 5.2% increase in existing home sales. This projection points to a transition towards a healthier, more sustainable housing market characterized by price stability and gradual demand recovery, rather than a return to rapid appreciation. The market is neither frozen nor overheating, striking a potentially beneficial balance.
