## Article summary
An intense cyclone system is expected to bring severe weather across the northern United States, with heavy snow, blizzard conditions, extreme cold, and damaging winds anticipated from Montana to Maine and Texas to Pennsylvania. More than 8 million people are under winter storm warnings, and nearly 2 million are under blizzard warnings. Meteorologists predict that an arctic front colliding with warm air could rapidly intensify into a "bomb cyclone" over the Midwest and Great Lakes. This phenomenon, known as bombogenesis, involves a rapidly deepening low-pressure area that generates harsh weather. Significant snowfall is expected in areas like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, with potential for blizzard conditions causing near-zero visibility and power outages. Marquette, Michigan, is preparing for potential power loss, with public works crews ready to clear roads. Minnesota is also bracing for major impacts, with blizzard warnings in effect and potentially life-threatening travel conditions expected. The "bomb cyclone" is also bringing frigid temperatures, with wind chills as low as 15 degrees below zero in Havre, Montana, and a dramatic temperature drop in Dallas, Texas. Freezing rain is forecast for the Northeast, causing travel issues in northern New England and New York. In New York City, remaining snow from the weekend storm is expected to freeze, creating further hazardous travel conditions early this week.
