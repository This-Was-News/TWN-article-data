## Article summary
Hawaii is implementing stricter laws and increased enforcement to curb illegal fireworks following a deadly New Year's Eve blast that killed six people. The incident, which occurred at a house party due to exploding illegal fireworks, resulted in severe burns for over a dozen others. Previously, there was little consequence for setting off illegal fireworks, but new legislation allows police to issue $300 citations, with repeat offenders facing felony charges and potential prison time. Law enforcement officials are hopeful that these measures, combined with public awareness from the tragedy, will reduce the use of illegal fireworks. An amnesty event saw the surrender of 500 pounds of illegal fireworks, and authorities are increasing port searches due to ties between illegal fireworks and organized crime. While fireworks have been a tradition in Hawaii, the increasing use of professional-grade aerials in densely populated neighborhoods poses a significant safety risk. The new laws aim to prevent future tragedies and address concerns from residents, including veterans who experience PTSD triggers from the explosions.
