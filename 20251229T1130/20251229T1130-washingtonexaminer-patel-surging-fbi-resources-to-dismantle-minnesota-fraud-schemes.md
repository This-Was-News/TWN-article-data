## Article summary
FBI Director Kash Patel is significantly increasing federal agents and resources in Minnesota to combat widespread fraud schemes, particularly those involving Somali immigrants. This action follows the indictment and conviction of individuals associated with Feeding Our Future, an organization accused of stealing $250 million in federal funds intended for children's meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patel stated that this case is likely the tip of the iceberg and vowed to continue investigating and protecting children. The FBI's efforts will focus on dismantling large-scale fraud exploiting federal programs. Independent journalist Nick Shirley has uncovered additional alleged fraud schemes, highlighting daycare centers with no enrolled children. This reporting has drawn criticism from Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who accused Minnesota Governor Tim Walz of ignoring the fraud for years. Walz's office has denied these accusations, stating the governor has worked to crack down on fraud and enhance oversight. Attention has also turned to Representative Ilhan Omar due to questions surrounding her husband's venture capital firm and her recent financial disclosure, which shows a substantial increase in net worth tied to the firm. Omar has denied any personal connection to the fraud scandal.
