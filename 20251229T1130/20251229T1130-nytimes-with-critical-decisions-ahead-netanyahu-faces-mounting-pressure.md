## Article summary
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's long-serving prime minister, faces mounting pressure from multiple directions as critical decisions loom in 2026. His criminal trial advances, President Trump's peace plan for Gaza progresses with potential US friction over Israeli actions in Syria and Lebanon, and polls suggest electoral defeat. The Israeli right, his political base, pushes for West Bank annexation despite US warnings. Netanyahu must navigate demands for ultra-Orthodox conscription exemptions, a move unpopular with the general public exhausted by the Gaza war. He also faces a choice regarding Gaza: allow it to devolve or align with Trump's plan, which is complicated by Israel's continued strikes and Netanyahu's refusal to involve the Palestinian Authority. This stance deters Arab and European nations seeking assurances for rebuilding Gaza and a path to Palestinian statehood, a precondition for Saudi Arabia's normalization with Israel. Furthermore, Netanyahu must decide whether to stick with his right-wing coalition, which relies on ultra-Orthodox and far-right parties for judicial overhaul efforts, or pivot to the political center to improve his electoral prospects. A potential, though difficult to imagine, exit strategy involves a plea deal for a legacy-defining achievement, such as normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia and advancing peace with the Palestinians, which could reshape the Middle East and potentially revive his political career.
