## Article summary
China's military has conducted joint drills around Taiwan, a move Beijing described as a warning against separatist and external interference forces. This action follows Beijing's anger over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and statements from Japan's prime minister regarding potential military involvement if China acts against Taiwan. Taiwan has placed its forces on alert, viewing the drills as an act of aggression and a threat to peace. The Chinese military stated the exercises aim to test sea-air combat readiness, joint seizure of superiority, and blockade capabilities, serving as a deterrent outside the island chain. These drills, involving various military branches and live firing exercises, are scheduled to continue. China has also imposed sanctions on U.S. defense companies due to arms sales to Taiwan. Taiwan's government condemned the drills, calling them a challenge to international law and order. The drills have heightened tensions in the region, with China increasing the scope and scale of its military exercises near Taiwan in recent years. Taiwan is accelerating the development of its air defense system in response to the ongoing military threat from China.
