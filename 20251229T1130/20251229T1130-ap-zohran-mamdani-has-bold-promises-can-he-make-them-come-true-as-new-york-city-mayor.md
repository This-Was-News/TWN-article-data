## Article summary
Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, is set to become the next mayor of New York City, facing intense scrutiny from Republicans, some Democrats, and progressives alike. He has promised to transform the city's government by shifting power towards working-class New Yorkers, with ambitious proposals like free child care and free city bus service. However, Mamdani must also manage the day-to-day responsibilities of running America's largest city, from trash collection to subway delays. Political strategists emphasize the importance of his first 100 days to demonstrate his ability to govern and secure early wins. His universal free child care plan has garnered support from Governor Kathy Hochul, though its funding remains unclear, and his pledge to freeze rent for stabilized apartments faces potential complications due to recent mayoral appointments. Mamdani's relationship with parts of the Jewish community is strained over his criticisms of Israel, and his past calls to defund the police department continue to be a point of contention. Despite these challenges, his decision to retain the current police commissioner has eased some concerns. His interactions with former President Donald Trump also remain a potential area for future tension due to their significant political differences.
