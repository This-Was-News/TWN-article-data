## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that a peace deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war is nearing completion following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago. Trump indicated that 95% of the deal is finalized, with only a few difficult issues remaining, such as security guarantees for Ukraine and potential land swaps. Zelensky confirmed that U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees are fully agreed upon, and European security guarantees are nearly finalized. While Trump suggested a deal could be reached sooner, Zelensky maintained that any land swap decisions would require a national referendum. The two leaders also engaged in discussions with European leaders, who commended the progress. Trump emphasized that Russia's input is still crucial and that he had a productive conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The coming weeks will involve continued negotiations, with U.S. and Ukrainian delegations set to finalize details next week, and Trump planning to host Ukrainian and European leaders at the White House in January.
