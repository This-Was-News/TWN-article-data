## Article summary
Patrons at a New Hampshire restaurant acted quickly to stop a gunman during a wedding at Sky Meadow Country Club, preventing a worse tragedy. One person, Robert Steven DeCesare, was killed, and two others were wounded. The suspect, Hunter Nadeau, a former club employee, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. Witnesses reported Nadeau made chaotic statements, including 'Free Palestine,' but authorities found no hate-based motivation. Patrons showed courage by subduing Nadeau, with one using a chair to strike him. The shooting occurred near a wedding, and additional charges are expected. Victims included an employee and a patron, with others suffering non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities are investigating the motive, and Gov. Kelly Ayotte offered support. The widow of DeCesare described her husband as a hero and asked for respect amid speculation.
