## Article summary
Thousands of people gathered at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, before sunrise on Sunday to attend the memorial service for Charlie Kirk. Attendees, dressed in red ties, flag prints, and MAGA merchandise, traveled from various states, including Idaho, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Mississippi. Some used canes and walkers, while others brought families with children. Danney Tanner drove 1,600 miles from Minnesota, adding 'I am Charlie' to his car's paint job. Many, including Tanner and Debra Archuleta, were turned away due to the overwhelming crowd. Archuleta, who drove three days from Virginia, expressed her faith and gratitude for being present. Nick Younger, who flew from Boise, found solace in his boss's support and his faith. Despite being turned away, attendees like Jordan Call emphasized the importance of free discussion and unity. Many headed to an overflow venue or returned to their vehicles as the main stadium gates closed.
