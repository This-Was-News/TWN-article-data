His assassination has sparked discussions about political violence. Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, was named the new CEO of Turning Point USA.

Kirk's impact on young conservatives and his role in boosting Trump's support among youth were noted by several Republican leaders. Vice President Vance acknowledged Kirk's influence in his own political career. The memorial service drew massive crowds, with many being turned away due to capacity limits.
