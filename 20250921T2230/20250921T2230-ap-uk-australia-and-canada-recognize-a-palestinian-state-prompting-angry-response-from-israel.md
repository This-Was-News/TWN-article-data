## Article summary
The U.K., Australia, and Canada formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, prompting an angry response from Israel. This coordinated initiative reflects growing outrage at Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza and its expansion of settlements in the West Bank. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the recognition, stating it aims to revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the move, stating a Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River. Hamas hailed the decision, calling it a rightful outcome of their struggle. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the U.K.'s announcement as a step toward a just and lasting peace. The U.K. and France have historic roles in the Middle East, having governed the region post-World War I. Recognizing Palestine is seen as correcting a colonial-era wrong. The U.K. has long supported an independent Palestinian state but has become increasingly worried that a two-state solution is becoming impossible due to Israel's actions in Gaza and the West Bank. The move is intended to keep the goal of a two-state solution relevant and alive.
