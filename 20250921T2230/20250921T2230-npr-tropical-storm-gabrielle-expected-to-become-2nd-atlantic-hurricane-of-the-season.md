## Article summary
Tropical Storm Gabrielle is projected to intensify into a hurricane by Sunday evening as it travels north across the Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday morning, the storm was located about 455 miles off the coast of Bermuda, moving northwest at 9 mph with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. Forecaster David Roth from the National Weather Service anticipates Gabrielle could reach maximum sustained winds of up to 105 mph, classifying it as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Sunday night or Monday, potentially bringing life-threatening swells and increased easterly winds. Although Bermuda is not expected to receive a direct hit, the swells could create dangerous surf conditions. The U.S. mainland is also forecast to avoid a direct impact, but swells could reach the East Coast north of North Carolina. After passing Bermuda, Gabrielle is projected to curve northeast toward the Azores. If it strengthens into a hurricane, it will be the second Atlantic hurricane of the season, nearly a month later than the average formation date of the second hurricane, which typically occurs around August 26. The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season concludes on November 30.
