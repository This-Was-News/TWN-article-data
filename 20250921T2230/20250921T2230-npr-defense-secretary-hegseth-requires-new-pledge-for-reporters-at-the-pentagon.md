## Article summary
The Pentagon is implementing new rules for journalists, requiring them to sign a pledge not to gather unauthorized information, including unclassified reports. The policy, outlined in a 17-page document, threatens to revoke press credentials for non-compliance. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the move on social media, stating that the public, not the press, runs the Pentagon. The new restrictions align with broader Trump administration efforts to limit coverage from outlets deemed unfair by the president. Media organizations and free press advocates have criticized the policy, arguing it undermines independent journalism and transparency. The Pentagon Press Association is reviewing the new policy, while NPR and other news outlets plan to push back against the restrictions. The changes follow earlier rules limiting reporters' movement within the Pentagon without an escort.
