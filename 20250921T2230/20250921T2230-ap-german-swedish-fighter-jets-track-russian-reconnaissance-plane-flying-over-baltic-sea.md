## Article summary
German and Swedish fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian reconnaissance plane flying over the Baltic Sea without identifying itself. Two Swedish Gripen jets and two German Eurofighter jets monitored and photographed the Russian IL-20 aircraft in international airspace. The Russian plane had not provided a flight path or radio contact. This incident occurred amid heightened alert for Russian military activities in the region. Earlier, three Russian fighter jets entered Estonian airspace without permission, staying for 12 minutes. This followed the downing of Russian drones over Poland by NATO planes, raising concerns about the war in Ukraine spilling over. Swedish and German air forces confirmed the monitoring of the Russian aircraft on their respective platforms. The German jets initially tracked the plane before handing over monitoring to the Swedish fighters and returning to their base. The incident ended without any issues. NATO and EU member countries remain vigilant about Russian military and reconnaissance activities in their airspace.
