## Article summary
The Senate confirmed 48 of President Trump's nominees after changing rules to expedite the process. Meanwhile, Democratic officials were arrested while protesting ICE's detention conditions in New York. President Trump suggested revoking broadcasters' licenses for negative coverage and designated antifa as a terrorist organization. The Trump administration also faced criticism for attempting to deport Guatemalan children without proper vetting. Additionally, the administration proposed changes to U.S. health aid delivery, focusing on the Western Hemisphere and Asia Pacific regions. The Supreme Court will review the Trump administration's tariffs, and Democrats proposed a $1 trillion plan to fund Medicaid and other health programs, increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown. The Trump administration also reinstated a harder citizenship test and faced backlash for potential changes to childhood vaccination schedules.
