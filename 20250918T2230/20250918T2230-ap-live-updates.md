## Article summary
Democrats have introduced a bill to protect free speech after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show following threats from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. The bill aims to bolster free speech protections against government officials, though it is unlikely to gain traction in a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats criticized the Trump administration for pressuring ABC after Kimmel's comments on the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk. Former Vice President Kamala Harris accused the administration of silencing critics through fear tactics. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is facing criticism for various actions, including withdrawing a water expert's nomination and plans to designate antifa as a terrorist organization. The U.S. also vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, highlighting its isolation on the issue. Additionally, Trump criticized European nations for buying Russian oil and discussed migration issues with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a state visit to the U.K.
