## Article summary
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted 8-3 to change recommendations for the MMRV vaccine, potentially removing it from the schedule for children under 4 due to a slightly increased risk of fever-related seizures. The panel also debated changes to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule, with some members questioning the necessity of universal vaccination at birth. The proposed changes face opposition from medical groups, who warn of increased public confusion and potential harm. The meeting comes amid controversy over Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s influence on vaccine policy, including the replacement of all ACIP members with his own selections. Critics argue the changes lack scientific justification and could reverse progress in disease prevention. The panel will vote on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and hepatitis B changes on Friday. The debate highlights tensions between the committee and the medical establishment, with concerns over the process and potential consequences of the proposed changes.
