## Article summary
The web page discusses the Trump administration's aggressive crackdown on mainstream media, exemplified by ABC's indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show following his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. President Trump celebrated the suspension, calling it 'Great News for America' and suggesting that networks with critical hosts should lose their broadcast rights. This action follows multimillion-dollar settlements from CBS and ABC in lawsuits filed by Trump, changes in CBS's interview presentation under administration pressure, and the appointment of a conservative ombudsman by CBS's parent company. The suspension also came after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Brendan Carr, hinted at potential punishments for local stations carrying Kimmel's show. Carr's comments echoed strategies from the Nixon administration, which pressured station licenses to influence network content. The page highlights the unprecedented nature of these attacks on media institutions and the potential chilling effect on free speech. Trump's administration is using legal settlements, regulatory pressure, and public statements to suppress dissenting voices in the media, marking a significant shift from his previous rhetoric against cancel culture and government censorship.
