## Article summary
President Donald Trump suggested reestablishing a U.S. presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, citing its proximity to China. He mentioned this during a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, linking it to countering China. Trump had previously raised the idea, but there's no confirmation of planning efforts. The U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021 under President Joe Biden, leading to a chaotic withdrawal and a Taliban takeover. Trump criticized Biden's handling of the withdrawal, claiming it emboldened Russia to invade Ukraine. He also suggested the Taliban might allow the U.S. military to return, as they need U.S. support. Trump emphasized the base's strategic value near China's nuclear weapons facilities. The U.S. and Taliban have had hostage negotiations, with an American tourist recently released. The Taliban claimed an agreement with U.S. envoys on a prisoner exchange, but the White House did not comment. The Pentagon referred questions about Bagram to the White House.
