## Article summary
The article discusses the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show by ABC following pressure from a Trump official, Brendan Carr, who criticized Kimmel's remarks about Tyler Robinson and President Trump's MAGA movement. Carr suggested consequences for Kimmel, and ABC quickly suspended the show, highlighting a chilling effect on late-night TV. Kimmel's comments were seen as controversial but not unprecedented in political satire. The article notes a pattern of Trump administration pressure on media outlets, including lawsuits and threats, leading to self-censorship. Other late-night hosts like Stephen Colbert have also faced similar pressures. The piece argues that while the U.S. is not an autocracy, the media environment is increasingly restrictive, with comedians and journalists facing significant constraints. The health of a democracy is measured by the freedom to mock leaders, and the current climate suggests a decline in this freedom. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of media companies standing up to political and financial pressure to preserve free speech.
