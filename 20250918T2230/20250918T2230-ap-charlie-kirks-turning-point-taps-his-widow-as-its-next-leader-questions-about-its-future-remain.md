## Article summary
Turning Point USA, founded by Charlie Kirk to mobilize young, Christian conservatives, has seen a surge in support following Kirk's assassination. The organization's board has unanimously elected Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, as its next leader, serving as CEO and board chair. Under Charlie Kirk's leadership, Turning Point became a multimillion-dollar operation and played a significant role in the 2024 election. Since his death, the group has attracted millions of new followers and inquiries to start new campus chapters. Erika Kirk has vowed to continue the group's mission, including planned events and the podcast. The organization has received unprecedented interest and financial support, with its nonprofit arms taking in nearly $100 million in 2024. Erika Kirk, an entrepreneur and podcaster, has her own following and is expected to continue her husband's legacy. Republican state legislator Alex Kolodin expressed confidence in Erika Kirk's ability to hold the movement together. Vice President JD Vance has also played a leading role in carrying Kirk's torch, guest hosting his radio show and encouraging followers to get involved. Despite discussions about replacing Charlie Kirk, some argue that his influence is irreplaceable.
