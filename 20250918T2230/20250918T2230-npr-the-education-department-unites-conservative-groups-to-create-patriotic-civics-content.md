## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Education has partnered with over 40 conservative organizations to create civics content celebrating the 250th anniversary of the United States. Led by the America First Policy Institute (AFPI) and overseen by the Education Department, the America 250 Civics Education Coalition aims to educate and inspire youth toward active citizenship. The initiative includes organizations like Turning Point USA, the Heritage Foundation, and Hillsdale College. The coalition plans to roll out a programming agenda over the next 12 months, including a 50-state speaking tour and a college speaker series. The goal is to renew patriotism, strengthen civic knowledge, and advance a shared understanding of America's founding principles. This announcement coincides with the Trump administration's efforts to return education control to the states. The federal government is legally prohibited from directing school curricula. Additionally, the Education Department will award grants to promote unbiased civic education. This initiative follows President Trump's previous efforts, such as the 1776 Commission, to promote patriotism in education.
