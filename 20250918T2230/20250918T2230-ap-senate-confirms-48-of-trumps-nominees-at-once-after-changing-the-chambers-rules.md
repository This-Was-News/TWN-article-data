## Article summary
The Senate confirmed 48 of President Donald Trump's nominees at once after changing its rules to clear a backlog of executive branch positions delayed by Democrats. Frustrated by Democratic stalling tactics, Senate Republicans altered the rules to allow multiple lower-level, non-judicial nominations to be confirmed with a simple majority vote. The new rules do not apply to judicial or high-level Cabinet posts. The Senate voted 51-47 to confirm the nominees, who had all received bipartisan votes in committee. Among those confirmed were Jonathan Morrison as administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Kimberly Guilfoyle as U.S. ambassador to Greece. Republicans have gradually weakened the filibuster over a dozen years, making the nominations process more partisan. Democrats have blocked more nominees than ever, opposing Trump and the GOP-dominated Congress. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans they would regret their action, echoing a similar warning from GOP Leader Mitch McConnell in 2013. Republicans plan to confirm more nominees in the coming weeks, aiming to fill Trump's administration at a pace similar to his predecessors.
