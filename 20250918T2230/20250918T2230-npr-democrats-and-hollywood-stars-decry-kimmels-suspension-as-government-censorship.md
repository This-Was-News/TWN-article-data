## Article summary
ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show following pressure from the Trump administration and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who objected to Kimmel's comments about Republicans' reaction to Charlie Kirk's killing. The suspension has sparked widespread criticism from Democrats, Hollywood stars, labor unions, and free speech groups, who view it as an attack on the First Amendment. President Trump, however, claimed Kimmel was fired due to poor ratings and offensive remarks. The move has been condemned as government censorship, with calls for Carr's resignation and investigations into the Trump administration's actions. Meanwhile, Republicans and some media outlets have supported the suspension, urging further action against Kimmel. The controversy highlights growing concerns about free speech and government interference in media.
