## Article summary
The Trump administration withdrew Ted Cooke's nomination to lead the Bureau of Reclamation, leaving the agency without permanent leadership. Cooke, a veteran water expert from Arizona, was preparing for a Senate confirmation hearing when his nomination was abruptly removed. He believes his withdrawal was due to political reasons and Colorado River basin intrigues, though no specific details were provided. The Bureau of Reclamation and seven states are currently negotiating water sharing amid ongoing drought and shrinking supplies. Cooke's nomination had drawn praise for his experience but also concerns from other Western states about his potential bias towards Arizona. The Colorado River is a vital resource for multiple states, tribes, and cities. Arizona's Mayor Mark Freeman expressed disappointment over the withdrawal, highlighting Cooke's expertise. Former officials and experts commented on the political nature of the decision and its impact on water management negotiations. The Bureau's acting leadership continues to work on river management solutions, and it remains unclear if the administration is considering other candidates for the position.
