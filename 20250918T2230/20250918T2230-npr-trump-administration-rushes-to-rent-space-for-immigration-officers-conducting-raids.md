## Article summary
The Trump administration is urgently leasing office space in 19 cities to accommodate a surge in immigration enforcement officers conducting widespread raids. The General Services Administration (GSA) has formed an 'ICE surge' team to secure around 300 fully furnished properties by winter. This effort follows recent government cuts and lease terminations, which are now being reversed to meet procurement needs. The push aligns with a broader government shift towards immigration enforcement, including diverting resources and expertise from other agencies. Congress allocated $75 billion to ICE to hire more officers and expand detention capacity. ICE aims to hire over 10,000 new officers by year-end, offering large signing bonuses. The agency is also increasing detention operations, leading to concerns over human rights and due process violations. Public disapproval of ICE operations, particularly in 'protected areas,' is growing. GSA employees are struggling with the chaotic process, facing increased lease rates and frustration over recent downsizing. Despite these challenges, GSA is working to support ICE's mission.
