## Article summary
Ukraine's top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, visited the besieged eastern city of Pokrovsk, where troops are engaged in street battles with Russian forces. This visit occurred as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy faces a significant corruption scandal involving the energy sector. The scandal led to the resignation of Ukraine's justice and energy ministers, as well as the dismissal of several officials from the state-owned nuclear power company, Energoatom. Investigators allege a kickback scheme that earned approximately $100 million, with a co-owner of Zelenskyy's media company suspected of masterminding it. The investigation has raised questions about the knowledge of high-ranking officials and echoes Zelenskyy's past attempts to curtail anti-corruption watchdogs. Despite the internal turmoil, the European Commission announced a 6 billion euro loan to Ukraine and promised further financial support, with President Ursula von der Leyen emphasizing the EU's commitment to Ukraine's future and countering Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy. Meanwhile, Gen. Syrskyi stated that Russian forces do not control Pokrovsk and are not operationally encircling Ukrainian defenses, highlighting efforts to regain control of city areas and secure supply and evacuation routes.
