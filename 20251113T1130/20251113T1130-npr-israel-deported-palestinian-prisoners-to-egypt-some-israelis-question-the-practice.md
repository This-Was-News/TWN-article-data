## Article summary
In exchange for Hamas freeing its final group of Israeli hostages, Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinians from prison in October. Of these, 154 prisoners serving long sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis were deported into exile. Israeli security experts argue this deportation policy aims to prevent released prisoners from resuming militant activity and threatening Israelis. However, past cases suggest this practice can have unintended security consequences. For instance, two prisoners released in a 2011 swap later took leadership roles within Hamas, with one orchestrating the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Another notable case is Saleh al-Arouri, who was deported in 2010 and credited with building Hamas' West Bank militant networks. While some Israeli analysts believe deporting high-risk prisoners abroad is preferable to their return to Palestinian territories, Palestinian human rights advocates criticize the deportations as forcible displacement. They argue that prisoners are not truly free if exiled from their homeland. Conversely, Israeli intelligence suggests a high percentage of previously released prisoners returned to militant activity. The ultimate destinations of the recently deported prisoners remain undetermined, with some initially housed in a Cairo hotel before being transferred to another location.
