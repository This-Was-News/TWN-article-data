## Article summary
President Trump signed a bill to end the 43-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, after the House narrowly approved it largely along party lines. The federal government began reopening Wednesday night, with some programs like food stamps expected to be restored quickly. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown's harm, while polls indicated most Americans blamed Republicans. The bill includes provisions to reverse federal worker layoffs and ensure retroactive pay. It also funds the government through January and includes separate bills for various programs through most of 2026. A controversial provision allowing Republican senators to sue the government for seized phone records was included, drawing bipartisan criticism, though House Republicans plan to introduce legislation to repeal it. Democrats, led by Hakeem Jeffries, aim to force a vote on extending healthcare subsidies, vowing to hold Republicans accountable in upcoming elections.
