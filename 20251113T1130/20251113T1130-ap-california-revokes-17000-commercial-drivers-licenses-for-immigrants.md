## Article summary
California is set to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses issued to immigrants because their expiration dates exceeded the drivers' legal residency status in the U.S. This action follows criticism from the Trump administration regarding states issuing licenses to individuals in the country unlawfully. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that California's move is an admission of improper action, despite previous defenses of its licensing standards. Governor Gavin Newsom's office countered that all affected drivers possessed valid federal work authorizations and that the state was adhering to a law requiring licenses to expire concurrently with legal status. Duffy accused California of acting improperly and vowed to continue scrutinizing licenses for truckers and school bus drivers. The issue gained public attention after a fatal crash in Florida caused by an unauthorized tractor-trailer driver. California's review was prompted by Duffy's concerns, and the state is now facing potential loss of federal funding if all improperly issued licenses are not invalidated. New federal restrictions implemented in September significantly limit which immigrants can qualify for commercial licenses, requiring verification of status and limiting validity to one year or the visa expiration, whichever is sooner. These new rules, however, are not retroactive, meaning existing license holders not meeting the new criteria can keep them until renewal.
