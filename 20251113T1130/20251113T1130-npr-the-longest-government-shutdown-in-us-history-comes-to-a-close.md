## Article summary
President Trump has signed a bill to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which lasted 43 days. The bill, passed with support from six Democrats in the House, extends current spending levels for most government agencies through January and provides funding for some, like SNAP, through September. It also includes provisions for back pay for federal employees and protections against further layoffs. However, the central issue of extending enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which expire at year's end, remains unaddressed in this bill. A deal was struck for a vote on legislation to extend these subsidies in December, but its passage is not guaranteed, with some Democrats expressing skepticism. Historically, government shutdowns have not been effective for advancing policy goals, and this instance proved no exception. Democrats had hoped to leverage the shutdown to secure an extension of ACA subsidies, but Republicans did not yield. The shutdown significantly impacted millions of Americans, including SNAP recipients and essential workers like air traffic controllers and TSA employees who worked without pay. Senators who voted to end the shutdown cited the ongoing suffering of everyday people as a key reason. While the immediate crisis is over, Congress faces the challenge of passing nine other appropriations bills before the current resolution expires. Democrats have until mid-December to craft a bill addressing ACA subsidies, which could serve as a policy victory heading into the midterm elections if successful, or a key messaging issue if Republicans block it. Some Republicans have expressed interest in addressing the subsidies but seek reforms. The president, while blaming Democrats for the shutdown, allowed Senate leadership to guide the resolution process.
