## Article summary
The longest federal shutdown in U.S. history, lasting over 40 days, has ended with President Trump signing legislation to reopen the government. However, the restoration of services and recovery for affected individuals and industries will take time. Federal workers are expected to receive back pay within about a week, though the exact timeline may vary by agency, and some may face higher tax rates due to lump-sum payments. SNAP benefits are anticipated to be fully restored within hours of the government reopening, impacting about one in eight Americans. Head Start early-childhood programs could take up to two weeks to fully come back online, affecting thousands of disadvantaged children. Air travel is estimated to return to normal within a week, contingent on air traffic controllers returning to work in sufficient numbers and the lifting of flight restrictions, with hopes of recovery before the Thanksgiving travel rush. Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, which closed during the shutdown, are expected to reopen following a schedule posted on their websites, similar to a four-day reopening after the previous shutdown in 2019. The release of economic data will be gradual, with September job market data likely available within days, but October data collection was paused, potentially impacting future reports and leading to data with caveats due to delayed surveys.
