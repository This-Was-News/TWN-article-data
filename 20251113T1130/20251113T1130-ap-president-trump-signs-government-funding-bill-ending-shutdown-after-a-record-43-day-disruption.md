## Article summary
President Donald Trump has signed a government funding bill, officially ending a record 43-day federal government shutdown. This prolonged disruption caused significant financial hardship for federal workers who did not receive paychecks, led to travel delays at airports, and resulted in increased demand at food banks. The shutdown highlighted deep partisan divisions, with Trump employing unilateral actions to pressure Democrats. Democrats had insisted on extending an enhanced tax credit for health coverage, a demand Republicans initially resisted. The eventual deal, brokered by eight senators, funds government through January 30th and includes a promise for a vote on the health care tax credits by mid-December. The bill also reverses federal worker firings and ensures back pay. Key provisions include funding for food assistance programs and increased security for lawmakers and Supreme Court justices. However, a contentious clause allowing senators to sue over electronic record searches drew criticism from both parties. The future of the health care tax credit remains uncertain, with potential for further debate and negotiation.
