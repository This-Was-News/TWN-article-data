## Article summary
The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days, has ended, but federal workers are still grappling with its severe financial and emotional toll. Many, like Jessie Holwell, a mother of five, resorted to taking on side jobs, accumulating debt, and postponing personal plans to cope with the loss of income. Despite the government reopening, the anxiety persists as workers face a backlog of tasks, potential future shutdowns due to short-term funding, and a perceived lack of concern from the administration. The shutdown has highlighted the instability of federal employment, with many workers feeling vulnerable and uncertain about their future. Some federal employees, particularly those in lower-paying positions like Social Security call center workers, faced extreme hardship, including difficulty covering basic living expenses. The situation has also exacerbated existing workload issues, as many federal employees had already been dealing with increased responsibilities due to workforce reductions. While back pay is expected, the process can be slow, and the financial strain may linger. The shutdown has also ignited frustration among some workers who felt their sacrifices were in vain, especially those who supported Democrats holding out for better healthcare provisions. Labor unions remain divided on the resolution, with some viewing the short-term funding patch as a capitulation. Ultimately, the experience has left many federal workers feeling vulnerable and determined to avoid such financial insecurity in the future.
