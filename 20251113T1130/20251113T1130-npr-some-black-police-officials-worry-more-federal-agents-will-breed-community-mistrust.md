## Article summary
Black police officials and community members are expressing concern over the deployment of federal agents and National Guard members into cities, particularly in communities of color. Residents like Jaiden Booth are preparing to support vulnerable populations, fearing increased harassment and mistreatment. Despite crime rates declining in cities like St. Louis, President Trump has suggested these cities need federal intervention. Missouri's governor has authorized the National Guard to assist ICE with clerical and logistical tasks. Donny Walters, president of St. Louis' Black police officers union, believes these heavy-handed tactics push communities backward and erode the trust Black officers have built. He argues for federal resources to support communities rather than increased enforcement. Renee Hall, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, likens these tactics to the Jim Crow era, stating that Black communities have a history of being over-policed. She advocates for interventions led by city leaders and social service organizations, emphasizing that such deployments are performative and do not yield actual crime reduction results.
