## Article summary
A U.S. District Judge ruled in a major antitrust case, allowing Google to retain its Chrome browser but imposing other penalties. The judge ordered Google to end exclusive deals that make Google the default search engine on devices, share certain search data with third parties, and establish a technological oversight committee for six years. The Department of Justice had filed an antitrust suit against Google in 2020, arguing that its exclusive agreements with device makers like Apple and Samsung unfairly boxed out competitors. The judge's decision fell short of the DOJ's most aggressive proposals, including the spinoff of Chrome. Google had maintained that it shouldn't have to divest part of its business to improve competition. The case is significant, marking the most consequential antitrust ruling against a tech company in over 25 years. Google has indicated it will appeal the decision. The ruling also addressed the potential impact on AI, with the judge ordering the sharing of some search data but not all, which could affect the development of AI products by competitors.
