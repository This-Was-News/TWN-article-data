## Article summary
Federal grand jurors in Washington, D.C., have refused to indict two individuals accused of threatening to kill President Donald Trump, marking at least seven instances of such refusals since Trump ordered increased federal presence in the district. The latest cases involve Edward Alexander Dana, accused of making death threats while in police custody, and Nathalie Rose Jones, charged with making threats on social media and during a Secret Service interview. Defense attorneys argue that prosecutors are bringing weak cases in response to Trump's surge, while U.S. Attorney Jeanne Prro claims the grand juries are politicized. Previous rejections include cases involving threats or assaults on federal agents. Grand jury proceedings are secret, but the repeated refusals have sparked speculation about protests against the White House's actions. Dana's threats were captured on an officer's body camera, while Jones' threats were made on Facebook and during a Secret Service interview, though her attorney maintains she had no intent to harm anyone.
