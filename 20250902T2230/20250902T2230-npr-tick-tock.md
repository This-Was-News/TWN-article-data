## Article summary
Congress has 14 legislative days to prevent a government shutdown as funding for federal agencies expires at the end of the month. Lawmakers are considering a short-term funding bill, but bipartisan support is needed. A long-term solution is challenging, with a House subcommittee proposing a $184.5 billion discretionary allocation, which Democrats criticize for cutting key programs. Bipartisan cooperation is further complicated by the White House's recent $5 billion pocket rescission of foreign aid, deemed unlawful by Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins. Democratic leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accuse the Trump administration of undermining Congress's constitutional authority. Meanwhile, lawmakers are also addressing issues like the National Guard's presence in D.C., Trump's nominees, and the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents. House Republicans and Democrats are collaborating to force a vote on releasing these documents, with bipartisan support expected.
