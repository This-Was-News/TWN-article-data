## Article summary
The Trump administration has barred nongovernmental groups from registering new voters at naturalization ceremonies, allowing only state and local election officials to provide these services. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced this policy change, stating that the use of nongovernmental organizations for voter registration at these events was inconsistent and burdensome. The League of Women Voters criticized the decision, emphasizing its long-standing role in registering new citizens. The League's CEO, Celina Stewart, argued that the policy restricts new citizens' access to their full rights and is part of a broader effort to intimidate immigrants. USCIS maintains that the change does not impact new citizens' access to voter registration information, which will still be provided by state, local officials, or USCIS staff. Republican-led states have recently enacted laws to restrict third-party voter registration drives, particularly affecting immigrant communities. Stewart asserted that excluding groups like the League makes it harder for new citizens to register to vote, viewing it as an intimidation tactic against the immigrant community. The League believes that the voices of new citizens strengthen democracy.
