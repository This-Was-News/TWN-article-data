## Article summary
On the eve of China's grand military parade, an activist in Chongqing staged a protest using a hidden camera and projector to display anti-Communist Party slogans on a building. The police took 50 minutes to locate and shut down the projection, but the activist had already recorded their response and released the footage online. The footage showed police officers discovering the projector and a surveillance camera aimed at them, along with a letter urging kindness. The activist, Q Hong, had left China days earlier and controlled the projection remotely. He aimed to turn the state's surveillance tools against itself, demonstrating resistance through technology. The act, which many saw as performance art, drew significant online attention and praise. Q Hong was inspired by other protesters like Peng Lifa and hoped to inspire others to challenge the Communist Party's rule. Despite his claims of not being brave, his actions highlighted the government's vulnerabilities and sparked discussions about freedom and democracy in China.
