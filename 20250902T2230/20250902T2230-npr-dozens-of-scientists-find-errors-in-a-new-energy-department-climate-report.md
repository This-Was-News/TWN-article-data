## Article summary
A group of over 85 scientists has issued a joint rebuttal to a recent U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) report on climate change, citing numerous errors and misrepresentations. The report, spearheaded by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, was authored by a small group of climate change skeptics, raising concerns about its objectivity. The scientists highlight instances where the DOE report cherry-picked data, such as claiming that rising carbon dioxide levels benefit U.S. agriculture while ignoring the negative impacts of extreme weather. The DOE report also misleads by stating there is no evidence of more intense meteorological droughts, which the scientists argue is incorrect given the evidence of climate change exacerbating droughts. The DOE defends the report, stating it was internally reviewed, but the scientists' critique has been submitted during the DOE's open-comment period. The report is being used by the Trump administration to justify rolling back climate pollution regulations. Critics argue the report aims to delay climate action, while supporters claim it will address any errors that arise during the comment period. The debate underscores the political and scientific tensions surrounding climate policy.
