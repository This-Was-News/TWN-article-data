## Article summary
A federal judge's ruling that President Trump has been illegally using troops for law enforcement in Los Angeles may hinder his plans to send troops to other cities like Chicago. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits federal troops from domestic policing, so Trump would need a legal justification for such deployments. The judge barred the federal government from using troops in California for various law enforcement activities. Trump criticized the judge, calling him a radical left judge, and plans to appeal the decision. Democrats praised the ruling, calling Trump's use of the military a political stunt. Trump has threatened to send troops to cities like Chicago and New York but has not invoked the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to use troops without state consent. The judge suggested that Trump may avoid invoking the act because he might not meet the legal requirements. The last time the Insurrection Act was used was in 1992, with the consent of state officials. Trump has sent troops to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles but has faced legal challenges over their use. The judge found that the administration used troops too expansively in Los Angeles, violating the Posse Comitatus Act.
