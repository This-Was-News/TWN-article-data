## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced plans to send federal law enforcement to Chicago and Baltimore despite opposition from local leaders. Trump stated he has an obligation to act, though he did not specify when the intervention would occur. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson strongly opposed the move, with Pritzker calling it unnecessary and unwanted. Trump has previously deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., where he federalized the police force, despite a federal judge ruling the California deployment illegal. Trump praised Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser for cooperating with federal forces but criticized Pritzker and Johnson. Chicago has been preparing for the federal presence, with activists and community leaders organizing protests and support systems. Pastors and local officials attributed the city's violence to systemic issues like underfunded schools and unemployment. Despite a recent decline in violent crime, Chicago's homicide rate remains a concern. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul vowed to sue once federal intervention begins, calling Trump's plan performative. Trump also mentioned plans to intervene in Baltimore, where local officials similarly oppose federal involvement. The White House reported over 1,650 arrests since federal forces were mobilized in Washington, D.C., with Trump claiming significant crime reduction in the city.
