## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. conducted a strike in the southern Caribbean on a drug-carrying vessel operated by Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, killing 11 people. The strike occurred in international waters, targeting a boat transporting illegal narcotics to the U.S. Trump shared a video of the explosion, though details about the vessel's occupants and drug cargo remain unclear. The Tren de Aragua gang, originating from Venezuela's Aragua state, has expanded amid economic turmoil and migration. Trump's administration has linked the gang to violence and drug trafficking. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dismissed the U.S. narrative, claiming a U.N. report shows minimal drug trafficking through Venezuela. The U.S. plans to bolster its maritime force in the region, while Maduro has deployed troops along Venezuela's coast and borders. The strike has heightened tensions, with Maduro vowing to defend Venezuela against U.S. aggression.
