## Article summary
President Trump announced that the U.S. Space Command headquarters will move from Colorado to Huntsville, Alabama. This decision follows a long battle over the headquarters' location, with Trump previously expressing his intention to move it to Alabama during his first term. The Biden administration had delayed the move, citing potential risks to military readiness. Space Command coordinates and oversees the nation's space assets, supporting the Space Force. Trump highlighted the economic benefits for Alabama, including thousands of jobs and billions in investment, and emphasized the strategic importance for national defense. Huntsville, known as 'Rocket City,' has a history of rocket development and is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. The move also has political implications, as Alabama is a reliably Republican state, while Colorado has trended Democratic. Trump denied that political considerations influenced his decision, instead criticizing Colorado's mail-in voting system. The announcement was made in the Oval Office, with Alabama's senators present.
