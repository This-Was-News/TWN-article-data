## Article summary
Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been released from federal immigration detention following a U.S. District Court judge's order, marking a significant victory for the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to El Salvador became a focal point of the Trump administration's immigration policies. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to release Abrego Garcia, stating that federal authorities detained him without legal basis after his return to the United States. His attorney confirmed his release, and Abrego Garcia intends to return to Maryland, where his wife and child reside. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's decision, calling it "judicial activism" and vowing to appeal. Abrego Garcia's legal team is prepared to fight against further deportation efforts, anticipating the government will continue to pursue removal. The judge's order noted that federal authorities had misled the court regarding potential deportation destinations. Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager, had previously been granted protection from deportation to El Salvador due to gang threats. He is also seeking to reopen his case to apply for asylum in the U.S. and is facing separate human smuggling charges in Tennessee, which his defense argues are vindictive.
