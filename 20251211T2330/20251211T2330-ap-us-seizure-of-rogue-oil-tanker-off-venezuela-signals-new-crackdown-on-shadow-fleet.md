## Article summary
The U.S. military has seized the oil tanker Skipper off the coast of Venezuela, a move that signals a new crackdown on the "shadow fleet" of vessels used to smuggle oil for sanctioned countries. The Skipper, which had been digitally manipulating its location to appear elsewhere, was found to be carrying millions of dollars worth of illicit crude oil. This seizure is seen as an escalation in U.S. efforts to pressure the Venezuelan government by cutting off oil revenues. The "shadow fleet" consists of hundreds of aging, often flagless tankers that operate in secrecy, obscuring their movements and cargo origins through various deceptive tactics. These vessels have become a vital lifeline for countries like Venezuela, Iran, and Russia, enabling them to circumvent international sanctions. The Skipper itself has a history of involvement in illicit oil smuggling networks, having previously been sanctioned for its role in transporting oil for Iran and Hezbollah. While Venezuela's oil production has increased recently through these smuggling operations, the physical seizure of tankers like the Skipper represents a significantly higher risk for operators than previous penalties. Experts suggest this action could deter future smuggling attempts and potentially impact global oil prices. The seizure was applauded by Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who stated that the regime uses oil revenues for repression rather than for the needs of its citizens.
