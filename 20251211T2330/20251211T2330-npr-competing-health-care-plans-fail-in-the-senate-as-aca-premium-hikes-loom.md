## Article summary
Both Republican and Democratic health care bills failed to pass the Senate on Thursday, leaving the future of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies uncertain as they are set to expire at the end of the year. This expiration is expected to cause significant premium hikes for millions of Americans. The Republican proposal, which focused on health savings accounts, was rejected by Democrats who argued it did not address premium costs and included restrictions on abortion and gender-affirming care. The Democratic bill, a three-year extension of existing ACA subsidies, also failed to gain enough Republican support. Republicans expressed concerns that extending the subsidies would perpetuate what they call "waste, fraud and abuse" within the ACA and benefit insurance companies. The failure of these votes highlights a division within the Republican party regarding health care cost control. Meanwhile, House Republicans are signaling upcoming votes on legislation aimed at lowering premiums. Bipartisan efforts in the House are underway with proposals to extend the ACA subsidies for one or two years, utilizing a discharge petition to bypass leadership. President Trump has been critical of the ACA subsidies but has not endorsed a specific legislative plan, though he has expressed support for direct financial assistance to Americans for healthcare costs.
