## Article summary
Federal guidance instructs Head Start early childhood programs to remove nearly 200 words and phrases, including "disability," "women," and "Black," from funding requests to avoid denial. This directive, submitted in court documents as part of a lawsuit by Head Start programs, conflicts with the program's mandate to provide linguistically and culturally appropriate services and early intervention for children with disabilities. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. The list of restricted terms came to light through a declaration by Mary Roe, executive director of a Wisconsin-based Head Start program, who was informed her renewal application was returned for containing words like "Racism" and "Racial." Roe highlighted the "impossible situation" created by this ban, as the Head Start Act itself includes many of the forbidden words, particularly concerning services for children with disabilities and inclusive classrooms. Disability-rights advocates have strongly condemned the list, calling it a violation of federal law and morally repugnant. Additionally, a Head Start program on a Native American reservation was told to remove sections prioritizing services for tribal members, despite federal law allowing such prioritization, and "tribal" is also on the restricted list. This follows a White House executive action against DEI policies and an earlier email from the Office of Head Start stating it would no longer approve funding for DEI initiatives.
