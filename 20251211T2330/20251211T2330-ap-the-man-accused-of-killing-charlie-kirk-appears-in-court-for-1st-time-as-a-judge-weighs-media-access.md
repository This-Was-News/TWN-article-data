## Article summary
Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, made his first in-person court appearance in Utah. A judge is currently deciding whether to grant further media access limitations in the high-profile case. Robinson's attorneys and the Utah County Sheriff's Office have requested that cameras be banned from the courtroom, citing concerns that extensive media attention could jeopardize his right to a fair trial. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Robinson, who is charged with aggravated murder in the Sept. 10 shooting on the Utah Valley University campus. Robinson appeared in court wearing restraints and a dress shirt, tie, and slacks, smiling at his family. A coalition of news organizations, including the Associated Press, is actively opposing the restrictions and advocating for continued media access. The judge has previously allowed Robinson to wear street clothes during pretrial hearings but mandated physical restraints due to security concerns, and also prohibited media from photographing these restraints to prevent potential juror prejudice. Charlie Kirk's widow has called for full transparency, while Robinson's defense team points to public statements, including one from former President Trump, as evidence of significant pretrial publicity that could impact fairness.
