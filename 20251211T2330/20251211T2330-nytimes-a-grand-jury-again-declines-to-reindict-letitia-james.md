## Article summary
A federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, has twice rejected calls to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James. This marks the second time in a week that jurors have declined to charge Ms. James, who had previously brought a civil case against President Trump. The grand jury refused to indict her on charges related to making false claims on a mortgage application. These repeated failures by prosecutors to secure an indictment are seen as a significant setback for the administration's efforts to pursue prosecutions against political opponents. The Justice Department's strategy of seeking second indictments after initial failures has been highlighted, suggesting considerable obstacles in charging President Trump's adversaries. While not legally barred from trying again, pursuing a third indictment might face judicial scrutiny. Ms. James had initially been charged after a former White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, was appointed U.S. attorney in Eastern Virginia. However, a judge later ruled that Ms. Halligan's appointment violated federal law concerning the filling of high-level federal vacancies. This ruling led to the dismissal of the case against Ms. James, as well as a separate case against former FBI Director James B. Comey.
