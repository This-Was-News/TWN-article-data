## Article summary
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced sharp questioning from Democratic lawmakers regarding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing. Some Democrats called for her resignation, citing concerns over aggressive immigration efforts and instances where individuals with no criminal records and U.S. citizens were caught in enforcement actions. Representative Bennie Thompson pressed Secretary Noem on the asylum approval process for an Afghan national charged in an attack on National Guard members, a vetting process Noem stated occurred during the Biden administration. Representative Shri Thanedar also expressed frustration with Noem's responses, asking if she would resign. The hearing occurred amid significant shifts in immigration policy, with the administration vowing to remove individuals in the country unlawfully and reviewing asylum applications approved during the Biden administration. Changes include halting visas for Afghans, pausing asylum decisions, and reviewing applications from individuals from countries subject to the travel ban. These policy shifts have already impacted immigrant applications for benefits, with some green card interviews and naturalization ceremonies being canceled. Additionally, the administration significantly reduced the number of refugees accepted, prioritizing certain groups.
