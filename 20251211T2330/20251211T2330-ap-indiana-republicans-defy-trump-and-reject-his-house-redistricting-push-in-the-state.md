## Article summary
Indiana's Republican-led Senate has rejected a proposed congressional map that would have favored the party, defying months of pressure from former President Donald Trump. This decision marks a significant setback for Trump's efforts to help Republicans maintain their House majority ahead of the midterm elections. Despite Trump's urging and similar redistricting efforts in states like Texas and Ohio, Indiana Republicans voted against the measure, with more opposing it than supporting it. Senator Spencer Deery stated that the federal government should not dictate state matters through threats. The proposed map aimed to eliminate Indiana's two Democrat-held districts, consolidating Republican control over all nine congressional seats. Trump had publicly pressured lawmakers, suggesting those who voted no should lose their seats, and conservative groups pledged to fund primary challenges against them. However, many Indiana Republicans, including former Governor Mitch Daniels, praised the senators for their principled stand against what they viewed as excessive pressure. Democratic lawmakers also spoke out against the redistricting, emphasizing the importance of political competition. Despite efforts from Vice President J.D. Vance and White House aides to garner support, the bill ultimately failed, highlighting divisions within the Republican party on the issue. The vote occurred amidst heightened tensions, with some lawmakers reporting threats and a hoax bomb threat targeting a state representative.
