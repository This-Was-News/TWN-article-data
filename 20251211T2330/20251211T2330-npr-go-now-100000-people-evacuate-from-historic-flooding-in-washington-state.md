## Article summary
Western Washington is experiencing historic flooding due to an atmospheric river, prompting widespread evacuations and a state of emergency. In Skagit County, over 100,000 residents are under mandatory evacuation orders as the Skagit River is projected to crest at unprecedented levels, potentially exceeding previous records by several feet. Officials are concerned about the integrity of dikes and levees, with some areas already showing seepage. Mount Vernon and Burlington have seen business and school closures, and emergency shelters are filling up, with challenges in providing food and accommodating pets. Governor Bob Ferguson has declared a state of emergency and is requesting expedited federal assistance from FEMA, highlighting the potential for catastrophic damage and a long recovery period. In Everett, the Snohomish River has peaked, but officials are monitoring potential road closures. The city of Duvall has also declared a state of emergency due to rising waters on the Snoqualmie River. Washington's congressional delegation has urged President Trump to approve the federal emergency declaration. Hundreds of National Guard members are being deployed to assist with sandbagging and other flood mitigation efforts.
