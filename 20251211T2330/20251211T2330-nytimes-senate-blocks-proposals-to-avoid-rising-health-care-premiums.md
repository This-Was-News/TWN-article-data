President Trump justified the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker by citing immigration, while his administration also imposed new sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector and Maduro family members. Trump announced an effort to curtail state regulation of artificial intelligence, arguing for a single federal source. A federal grand jury declined to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James for the second time, a setback for the Trump administration's efforts against political opponents. The Trump administration sided with Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Iran to block a UN report summary on the environment that called for phasing out fossil fuels. In Indiana, Republican state senators defied President Trump by voting down a new congressional map that would have favored Republicans. A federal judge ordered the release of an immigrant detained for months without lawful authority, a ruling the White House called judicial activism. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced sharp questioning from Democrats regarding immigration enforcement tactics, with some calling for her resignation. The Senate's failure to act on healthcare means millions of Americans may lose access to affordable coverage, setting the stage for a political battle.
