## Article summary
Texas is experiencing a significant influx of residents, particularly from California and Florida, with more people moving into the state than leaving for those populous states. An analysis of over 1.6 million moves between June 2024 and May 2025 revealed that 265,112 individuals relocated to Texas from out of state. California and Florida accounted for nearly one-third of these new residents, with more than double the number of Californians moving to Texas than vice versa. Similarly, about one-third more Floridians moved to Texas compared to Texans moving to Florida. The primary drivers for this migration appear to be economic opportunity, affordability, and a higher quality of life, especially as Texas has no state income tax, unlike many of the states people are leaving. Gen X and millennials constitute 75% of new Texans, indicating a trend of professionals and families seeking new prospects. North Texas, particularly the Dallas-Fort Worth area, is the top destination, followed by Houston and Austin. This trend is further supported by U.S. Census Bureau data, which shows Texas counties among the top for population growth, while California counties, like Los Angeles, are experiencing net losses. States with Democratic leadership and higher taxes, such as California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Illinois, are seeing more residents leave than arrive.
