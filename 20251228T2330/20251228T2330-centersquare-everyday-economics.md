## Article summary
As the new year begins, the housing market is shifting from reflection to recalibration, with key data releases like pending home sales and the Case-Shiller Home Price Index set to shape the outlook for 2026. The Zillow Housing Market Report offers an early, more timely view of trends, indicating a return to seasonality after an unseasonably active fall. Newly pending home sales softened in November due to colder weather and holidays, but remained above year-ago levels, suggesting underlying demand persists despite affordability constraints. National home values showed stability year-over-year in November, yet this masks significant variations, with 53% of homes experiencing a value decline over the past year. This unevenness reflects market adjustments to higher borrowing costs and increased inventory in some areas. Looking ahead to 2026, Zillow forecasts a modest 1.7% rise in home values and a 5.2% increase in existing home sales. This suggests a transition towards a healthier, more sustainable market characterized by price stability and gradual demand recovery, rather than a return to rapid appreciation. The market is neither frozen nor overheating, striking a potentially beneficial balance.
