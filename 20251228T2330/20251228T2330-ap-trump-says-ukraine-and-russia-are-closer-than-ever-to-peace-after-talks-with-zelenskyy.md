## Article summary
President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Florida resort, asserting that both Ukraine and Russia are closer than ever to a peace deal. Trump stated he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin genuinely desires peace, despite ongoing Russian attacks on Ukraine. The leaders discussed proposals to end the nearly four-year war, acknowledging that significant issues, such as territorial control, remain unresolved. Following their meeting, they communicated with several European leaders to discuss the situation. Zelenskyy expressed readiness for peace and thanked Trump for his efforts. Trump indicated he would speak with Putin again soon, with both sides agreeing to further discussions. However, Russian officials noted that Kyiv needs to make bold decisions regarding disputed territories for a complete cessation of hostilities. Recent Russian strikes on Ukraine, including attacks on civilian homes and Kyiv, highlight the ongoing conflict. Trump acknowledged that negotiations could falter, but expressed optimism about a resolution within weeks. The discussions involved security guarantees for Ukraine and potential compromises on its NATO aspirations. Zelenskyy also mentioned that while progress has been made, sensitive issues still require intensive work in the coming weeks. The peace proposal is reportedly about 90% ready, with the U.S. offering security guarantees and Ukraine considering dropping its NATO bid in exchange for protection. Putin's demands include recognition of Russian territorial gains and Ukraine's withdrawal from certain areas, which Kyiv has rejected.
