## Article summary
New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has responded to criticism from X CEO Elon Musk regarding his choice for FDNY commissioner. Mamdani appointed Lillian Bonsignore, a retired EMS chief with over 30 years of experience, to lead the Fire Department. Musk had publicly stated that people would die due to this appointment, citing a lack of firefighter experience and highlighting Bonsignore's status as the first openly gay commissioner. Mamdani defended his choice by emphasizing Bonsignore's extensive experience in EMS, which handles a significant portion of FDNY calls. He also pointed out that her background directly addresses the needs of the department. Bonsignore herself expressed confidence in her ability to lead, stating her deep understanding of both firefighter and EMS needs. Mamdani has also decided to retain Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner, a move that aligns with his approach to public safety leadership. The exchange highlights a public debate over qualifications and experience in high-stakes public service roles.
