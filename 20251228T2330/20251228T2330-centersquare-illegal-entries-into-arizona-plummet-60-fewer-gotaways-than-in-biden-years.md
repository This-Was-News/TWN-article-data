## Article summary
Illegal border crossings into Arizona have significantly decreased, with a 92% drop in apprehensions and a 60% reduction in gotaways compared to the Biden administration years. Under President Trump's first year in office, Arizona saw record lows in illegal entries. In fiscal year 2025, 65,813 illegal border crossers were apprehended in Arizona, a stark contrast to over 775,000 in fiscal year 2023, which included nearly 200,000 gotaways. The Center Square exclusively obtained gotaway data, revealing that many individuals attempting to cross illegally have criminal records or are on terrorist watchlists. During the Biden administration, the Tucson and Yuma sectors in Arizona were heavily impacted, with checkpoint closures and tactics like 'task saturation' overwhelming Border Patrol agents. Task saturation involves smuggling organizations sending numerous small groups of migrants across the border simultaneously to deplete Border Patrol resources, allowing contraband and criminals to pass undetected. However, under Trump's policies, Arizona Border Patrol agents are now actively in the field, supported by the National Guard and Coast Guard. Illegal border crossers are being processed for expedited removal rather than being released into the interior. The Department of Homeland Security is expanding smart wall construction and border barrier infrastructure in Arizona, while recruitment for DHS, CBP, and Border Patrol has reached record highs.
