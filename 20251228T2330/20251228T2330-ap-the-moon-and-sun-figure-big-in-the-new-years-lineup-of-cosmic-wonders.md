## Article summary
The year 2026 promises a spectacular lineup of celestial events, with the moon and sun taking center stage. The year kicks off with astronauts returning to the moon for the first time in over 50 years, alongside a fleet of robotic lunar landers, including Jeff Bezos's new Blue Moon. A supermoon graces the sky on January 3rd, followed by an astronomical blue moon in May. The sun will also be a focal point with a ring-of-fire eclipse in the Antarctic on February 17th and a total solar eclipse crossing the Arctic, Greenland, Iceland, and Spain on August 12th. More auroras are expected, though possibly less frequently than in recent years. The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, a visitor from another star, will be fading but still visible with powerful telescopes, heading towards Jupiter in March. Six planets will be visible in a parade around February 28th, with Mars joining a different planetary lineup in August. Three supermoons are predicted for 2026, with the closest occurring on Christmas Eve. The sun's activity is expected to remain high, potentially leading to more geomagnetic storms and auroras, though the 11-year solar cycle is beginning its decline.
