## Article summary
President Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago to discuss a peace plan for the war in Ukraine. Ahead of the meeting, Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who expressed interest in peace. European leaders also participated in calls, commending progress made so far and emphasizing the need for security guarantees and an end to the war. Polish President Karol Nawrocki stressed that any regional peace arrangements must involve all interested parties. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted good progress and Europe's readiness to continue working with Ukraine and the US. Trump suggested Putin was open to working with Ukraine on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, stating it was a significant step that he wasn't bombing it. Both leaders acknowledged the complexity of ending the war, with Zelensky indicating a 90 percent completion of a peace plan, though key issues like eastern territory and the nuclear plant remain. Trump stated there would be a strong security agreement involving European nations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, however, dismissed the idea of European peacekeepers in Ukraine and criticized EU leaders for hindering peace. Trump indicated he had no deadline for a peace agreement, believing both Russian and Ukrainian presidents want a deal.
