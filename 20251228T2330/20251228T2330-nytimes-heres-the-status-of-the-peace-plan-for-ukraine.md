## Article summary
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine met with President Trump to discuss a revised 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the war with Russia. The plan, developed with the United States, covers security guarantees, rebuilding efforts, and economic cooperation. Key areas of agreement include security assurances, such as maintaining a large army funded by Western partners and Ukraine's potential EU membership, along with a bilateral security agreement with the US. Provisions to prevent hostilities, like monitoring the contact line and releasing prisoners, are also included. However, significant sticking points remain, particularly regarding the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in the Donetsk region and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine proposes a demilitarized zone that includes Russian-controlled areas, while Russia likely seeks full control of Donbas. The plan also outlines economic opportunities for the US, including investment in a Ukraine Development Fund and cooperation on resource extraction. Russia, through President Putin, has indicated a waning interest in negotiations as its military advances, urging Ukraine to accept terms for peace. Putin's recent conversation with Trump suggested an agreement that a long-term settlement is preferable to a temporary ceasefire, emphasizing the need for Ukraine to make a decision regarding Donbas.
