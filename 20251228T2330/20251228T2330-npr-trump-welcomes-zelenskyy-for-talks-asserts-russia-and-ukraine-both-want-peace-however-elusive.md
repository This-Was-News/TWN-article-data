## Article summary
President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago resort, expressing belief that both leaders desire peace. Trump had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the meeting and planned to speak again. Zelenskyy stated he would discuss territorial concessions, which have been a point of contention for Ukraine, and that negotiators have been working towards peace. Russia had intensified attacks on Ukraine's capital in the days leading up to the meeting, causing casualties. Zelenskyy also spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and planned to contact other allies. He had previously met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who announced further economic aid for Ukraine. Zelenskyy indicated a willingness to withdraw troops from eastern Ukraine if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone. Discussions between U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have progressed, with a peace proposal reportedly nearing completion. The U.S. has offered security guarantees to Ukraine, and Zelenskyy has suggested he might drop Ukraine's NATO bid in exchange for such protections. Trump has been working to end the conflict, though he has expressed frustration with the complexities involved. Putin's demands include recognition of Russian control over occupied territories and Crimea, and Ukraine's abandonment of its NATO aspirations. Kremlin officials have indicated that reaching a compromise may be a lengthy process.
