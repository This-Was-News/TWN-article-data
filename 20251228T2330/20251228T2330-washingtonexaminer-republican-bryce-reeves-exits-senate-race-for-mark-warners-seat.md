## Article summary
Virginia Republican state Sen. Bryce Reeves has withdrawn from the 2026 U.S. Senate race to challenge incumbent Mark Warner. Reeves cited a serious family health matter that requires his full attention at home. He will instead focus on his reelection campaign for the Virginia state Senate, representing the 28th District. Reeves stated his commitment to continuing his work in the General Assembly on economic strength, military support, and bond ratings. His departure leaves the Republican Party without a prominent challenger to Warner, who is seeking his fourth term. Reeves also acknowledged recent Republican electoral setbacks in Virginia and urged party unity. He encouraged his colleagues to cease infighting and rally behind strong leadership. The decision comes after prayerful reflection and discussions with his family. Reeves' faith and family are his top priorities.
