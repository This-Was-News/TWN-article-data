## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that a peace deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war is nearing completion following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago. Trump stated that 95% of the peace deal is finalized, with only a few thorny issues remaining, such as security guarantees for Ukraine and potential land swaps. Zelensky confirmed that U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees are fully agreed upon, with European guarantees nearing completion. While Trump suggested a land swap might be beneficial now, Zelensky maintained that any such decision would require a national referendum. The two leaders also engaged in discussions with European leaders over the phone, who commended the progress. Trump indicated that the deal is still a few weeks away and offered to address Ukraine's parliament to help finalize it. Crucially, Russia's input is still required, and Trump reported a productive conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with further discussions planned. Delegations are set to finalize the discussed issues next week, and Trump is scheduled to host Ukrainian and European leaders at the White House in January.
