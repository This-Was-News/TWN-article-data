## Article summary
The burgeoning demand for memory chips driven by artificial intelligence is creating a global shortage, with prices expected to rise for various technology devices. This surge in demand, particularly for RAM chips used in AI data centers, now exceeds supply, leading to significant price increases for manufacturers. Companies are paying substantially more for these chips, and this trend is projected to continue through 2026. As chipmakers prioritize the lucrative AI market, fewer memory chips are available for other products like smartphones, computers, and gaming consoles. This reallocation of resources and the overall supply-demand imbalance are expected to drive up consumer prices for these devices. Analysts indicate that there is no immediate solution to this bottleneck, as expanding production capacity will take time. New manufacturing facilities are under construction, but they are not expected to be operational until 2027. Consequently, consumers should anticipate higher prices for technology products in the foreseeable future due to the ongoing AI boom's impact on the memory chip market.
