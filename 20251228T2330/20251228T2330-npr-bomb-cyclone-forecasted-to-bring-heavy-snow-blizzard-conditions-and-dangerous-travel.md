## Article summary
An intense cyclone system is projected to bring severe weather across the upper United States, with heavy snow, blizzard conditions, extreme cold, and damaging winds expected from Montana to Maine and Texas to Pennsylvania. Over eight million people are under winter storm warnings, and nearly two million are under blizzard warnings. Meteorologists anticipate a 'bomb cyclone,' a rapidly intensifying low-pressure system, could form over the Midwest and Great Lakes through Monday, creating harsh weather. Significant snowfall of 6-12 inches is predicted for areas including Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, with blizzard conditions leading to near-zero visibility and potential power outages. Marquette, Michigan, is preparing for these conditions, with public works crews ready to manage snow and the Board of Light & Power equipped for electricity loss. Minnesota is also bracing for major impacts, with the Twin Cities potentially receiving up to 10 inches of snow and life-threatening travel conditions anticipated. The 'bomb cyclone' is also driving down temperatures, with wind chills as low as 15 degrees below zero in Havre, Montana, and a dramatic temperature drop expected in Dallas, Texas. In the Northeast, freezing rain is forecast to cause travel issues, and in New York City, melting snow refreezing will create further hazardous conditions early this week.
