## Article summary
A 2013 attempt by conservative Republicans to leverage a government shutdown to repeal the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day closure with no changes to the law, ultimately proving to be a political debacle for the party. In contrast, the current shutdown sees Democrats using their leverage to fortify the law by extending tax credits for rising premiums, while Republicans criticize the impact of the shutdown on government services. Democrats believe their position is stronger due to public support for the subsidies and polls indicating more blame is placed on Republicans for the closure. This tactic of forcing policy changes through shutdown politics has historically been unsuccessful, as noted by Senator Lindsey Graham regarding a previous shutdown aimed at building a wall. The 2013 shutdown was preceded by an extended conservative campaign to defund Obamacare, despite internal Republican opposition and warnings from figures like Senator Harry Reid about the historical failures of such tactics. The fight, notably featuring Senator Ted Cruz's 21-hour speech, ultimately elevated him among conservatives but alienated others who saw it as a no-win situation. The shutdown repercussions also blunted the political fallout for Democrats from the Obamacare website's disastrous rollout. Years later, with the current shutdown extending and nearing record lengths, Republicans express openness to negotiating healthcare subsidies but insist Democrats reopen the government first. However, recent developments, including a federal judge's order to continue food stamp payments and upcoming elections, suggest a potential shift, with Democrats hoping for a victory that could allow them to claim a measure of success, a stark contrast to the Republicans' 2013 experience.
