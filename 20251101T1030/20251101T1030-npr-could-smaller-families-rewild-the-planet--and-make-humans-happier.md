## Article summary
The world is experiencing a significant population shift as families, particularly in developed nations, are having fewer children. This trend, driven by individuals choosing to delay or forgo parenthood to pursue other life goals, has profound implications. Proponents, like John Davis of the Rewilding Institute, believe a smaller human population could lead to environmental restoration, reduced consumption, and a better chance of addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. They advocate for a "small family ethic" among affluent populations, emphasizing reproductive freedom and family planning rather than coercion. Economists like Claudia Goldin suggest that people are happier when they can freely decide if and when to have children. Furthermore, research indicates that delaying motherhood and having fewer children often results in increased educational attainment, financial security, and better health for women. However, this demographic change also raises concerns about the sustainability of economies and social systems built on population growth. Sociologists like Martina Yopo-Díaz highlight the challenges for labor markets, pension systems, and social structures that rely on generational replacement. While the transition presents policy hurdles, such as funding elder care with a smaller workforce, advocates remain hopeful that human ingenuity will find solutions, potentially leading to a happier world for both people and wildlife.
