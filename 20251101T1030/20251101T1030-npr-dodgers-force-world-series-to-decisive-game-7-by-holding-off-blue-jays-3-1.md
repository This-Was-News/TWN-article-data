## Article summary
The Los Angeles Dodgers forced a decisive Game 7 in the World Series by defeating the Toronto Blue Jays 3-1 in Game 6. Yoshinobu Yamamoto secured his second win against Toronto, pitching six innings and allowing only one run. The Dodgers took a 3-0 lead in the third inning, highlighted by Mookie Betts's two-run single, breaking an 0-for-13 streak with the bases loaded. Rookie relievers Justin Wrobleski and Roki Sasaki combined for outs before starter Tyler Glasnow entered the game in the ninth inning to secure the win. Glasnow escaped a bases-loaded jam with a remarkable game-ending double play initiated by Kiké Hernández. Max Scherzer is set to start Game 7 for the Blue Jays, aiming for their first World Series title since 1993. The Dodgers, seeking their third title in six seasons, will rely on their pitching depth, with Shohei Ohtani also potentially playing a role. Yamamoto has been a dominant force for the Dodgers in the postseason, with a low ERA in his starts. Kevin Gausman matched a Series record with eight strikeouts in the first three innings but ultimately took the loss for the Blue Jays. The series now heads to a winner-take-all Game 7.
