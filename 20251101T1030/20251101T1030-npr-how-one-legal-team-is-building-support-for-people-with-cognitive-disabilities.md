## Article summary
Noah Cox, a lawyer in the Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office, established the neurocognitive disorder team to address the overrepresentation of individuals with cognitive disabilities in the justice system. Cox observed that many of his clients struggled with communication and logical thinking, indicative of underlying cognitive impairments. These impairments can stem from conditions like Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Down Syndrome, traumatic brain injuries, or intellectual disabilities, and often go undiagnosed throughout a person's life. Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are more likely to be victims of violent crimes and are also more easily misunderstood, leading to a cycle of involvement with the justice system. They may not grasp consequences, discern trustworthy individuals, or resist suggestion, making them vulnerable during police interrogations. The neurocognitive disorder team aims to provide alternatives to incarceration, such as diversion programs, for these individuals. The team works to gather evidence, conduct evaluations, and advocate for clients to access support services. Jimmy, a client diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability at age 54, is currently participating in a two-year diversion program. His program includes therapy and participation in a day program for adults with disabilities, marking a significant positive change in his life. He reports no longer using drugs, being homeless, or feeling frustrated, viewing his life as a clean slate.
