## Article summary
President Trump claimed that a lapse in SNAP funding would primarily affect Democrats, but data suggests otherwise. While Democrats may represent a slightly larger portion of SNAP recipients, millions of Republicans also rely on the program. Geographic breakdowns show that states and congressional districts with high SNAP participation rates are represented by both Democrats and Republicans. A 2012 survey indicated that conservatives were as likely as liberals to have received food stamps. Furthermore, rural counties, which largely voted for Trump, are disproportionately affected by SNAP interruptions. A recent analysis found that counties with the largest increases in SNAP households voted for Trump in 2020. Despite Trump's assertion, a federal judge ordered the administration to continue funding the program during the government shutdown, though benefit delivery remained uncertain.
