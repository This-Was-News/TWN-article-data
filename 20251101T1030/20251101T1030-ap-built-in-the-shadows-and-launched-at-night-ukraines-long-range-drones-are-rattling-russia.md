## Article summary
Ukraine is increasingly using long-range drones assembled in secret locations to strike deep into Russia, targeting oil refineries, fuel depots, and military hubs. These domestically produced drones, like the "Liutyi," have significantly increased their range over the past year, with some capable of reaching targets within a 1,000-kilometer radius. The attacks have begun to rattle Russia, causing gasoline shortages in some regions and stretching Moscow's air defenses thin. Western analysts suggest these strikes have impacted about 38% of Russia's refining capacity, although most plants have resumed operations. The Ukrainian Security Service reports over 160 successful strikes on Russian oil facilities this year. This drone campaign allows Ukraine to take the initiative within Russia, forcing Moscow to reroute supplies and commit air defenses to a wider area. The low cost of these drones, around $55,000 each, further challenges Russia's expensive air defense systems. While fewer than 30% of drones reach their targets, the strategic logic is to degrade Russia's capacity to sustain large-scale operations. This homegrown capability provides Ukraine with autonomy, bypassing the need for Western approval for imported long-range weapons. The conflict's geography has shifted, as Russia can no longer assume its territory is safe from attack.
