## Article summary
Two federal judges have ordered the Trump administration to use emergency reserve funds to continue paying for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the government shutdown. The U.S. Department of Agriculture had planned to freeze payments starting November 1, as the shutdown impacted the program which serves approximately one in eight Americans and costs about $8 billion monthly. Judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that the administration must fund the program, though the exact amount and timeline for November payments remain uncertain, potentially delaying benefits for many. The administration stated it was legally required to comply if given appropriate legal direction from the court. Democratic officials and organizations had challenged the plan to pause SNAP, arguing the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running and that contingency funds are available. One judge also ruled that previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. Despite the rulings, many beneficiaries may still experience delayed benefits due to processing times. Advocates expressed relief but acknowledged the temporary nature of the win, while the possibility of reduced benefits still causes concern for recipients. The court's decisions are seen as protecting millions from being used as leverage in political disputes and upholding the principle that no one should go hungry.
