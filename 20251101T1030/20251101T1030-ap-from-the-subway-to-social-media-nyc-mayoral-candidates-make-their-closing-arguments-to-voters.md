## Article summary
As Election Day approaches, New York City mayoral candidates Andrew Cuomo, Zohran Mamdani, and Curtis Sliwa are making their final appeals to voters. Cuomo, running as an independent, positions himself as the experienced leader capable of ensuring safety and progress, warning that Mamdani's inexperience could lead the city to ruin. He targets Republicans, urging them to vote for him over Sliwa. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, aims to maintain the progressive momentum from his primary victory, countering attacks by emphasizing his connection with diverse New Yorkers through social media and personal outreach. He warns supporters against complacency, highlighting the need for continued engagement. Sliwa, focusing on public safety, campaigns aggressively in the city's subways and streets, criticizing his Democratic opponents as similar in their approach. He argues for a compassionate leader, contrasting himself with Cuomo's perceived coldness. Mamdani, meanwhile, has held large rallies and engaged with various media platforms, including social media influencers and The Daily Show, to promote his platform. His energetic campaign style appears to be resonating with some undecided voters. The closing arguments reflect the candidates' distinct strategies and core messages in the final days of the race.
