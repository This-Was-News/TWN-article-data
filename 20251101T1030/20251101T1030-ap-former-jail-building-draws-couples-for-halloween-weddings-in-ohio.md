## Article summary
Nine couples exchanged vows on Friday inside a former county jail in Delaware, Ohio, which had been decorated for Halloween. The 1878 building, now owned by the Delaware County Historical Society, was the county lockup until 1988. Couples like Andrea Bates and Jessica Scales, and Nicole Bond and Jacob Beatty, were drawn to the unique Halloween-themed wedding opportunity. Court officials in Delaware County, who conduct weddings every other Friday, organized the event when they realized Halloween fell on a Friday this year. Court employees embraced the theme by wearing costumes and decorating the jail with pumpkins and spider webs. The couples were also offered the chance to take mugshot-style photos. Organizers had capped the event at 10 weddings, and nine couples ultimately participated in the spooky nuptials.
