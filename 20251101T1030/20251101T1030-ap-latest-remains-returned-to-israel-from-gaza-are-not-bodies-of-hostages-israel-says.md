## Article summary
Israel has stated that the remains of three individuals handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross this week do not belong to any of the hostages. This development follows Israel's return of 30 Palestinian bodies to Gaza, which was part of an exchange after militants returned the remains of two hostages. The unidentified remains were examined in Israel, with military officials confirming they were not those of any hostages. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also issued a statement to this effect. It remains unclear who the three individuals were or why their remains were returned to Israel. Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire began, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 17 hostages. However, the process of returning the bodies of the remaining 11 hostages is progressing slowly. Israel has returned a total of 225 Palestinian bodies since the ceasefire started, with 75 identified by families. The fragile truce has faced challenges, including Israeli strikes across Gaza that resulted in numerous casualties, following the killing of an Israeli soldier and incomplete hostage returns.
