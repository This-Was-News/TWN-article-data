## Article summary
Millions of Americans are facing uncertainty regarding their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits due to the ongoing government shutdown. A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the White House to use contingency funds to pay for these benefits, but the situation remains unclear due to a separate decision in Massachusetts. President Trump has directed lawyers to find a way to pay for SNAP, but delays are expected. Food bank administrators are warning of a potential public health crisis, as they are not equipped to handle the widespread need that SNAP typically addresses. Organizations like Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico and Central Texas Food Bank are experiencing a significant increase in demand. Businesses that offer discounted food are also seeing more interest. Meanwhile, the shutdown is also impacting open enrollment for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, with potential premium increases for consumers. Democrats are pushing to extend enhanced ACA subsidies, while Republicans insist on funding the government first. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has criticized Democrats for only now recognizing the consequences of the shutdown.
