## Article summary
The Trump administration has announced a $12 billion one-time payment program to aid farmers, primarily those growing soybeans and corn, who have been impacted by recent tariff hikes. This initiative, dubbed the Farm Bridge Assistance program, aims to provide support until President Trump's broader economic policies, including tax reductions and tariffs, become more effective. The funds will be disbursed from the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. President Trump stated that a portion of the revenue generated from his tariff program would be allocated to this farmer assistance. The administration views this as a way to address economic concerns within a key constituency and support farmers through a period of falling crop prices and rising input costs, exacerbated by tariffs. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly emphasized that this move demonstrates the President's commitment to the agriculture industry and aims to bridge the gap until his policies yield greater results. Trump also indicated plans to reduce environmental regulations on agricultural machinery to lower costs. However, tariffs have also negatively impacted manufacturers like John Deere, which has estimated significant losses due to these policies.
