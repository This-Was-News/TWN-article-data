## Article summary
Police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, arrested Luigi Mangione, who is suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The arrest occurred at a McDonald's, where an officer found a loaded gun magazine in Mangione's backpack, which convinced police he was the suspect. Mangione's defense is arguing that evidence found in his backpack, including the magazine, a 9mm handgun, and a notebook, should be excluded from the trial because the search was conducted without a warrant. Prosecutors contend the search was legal, and that the handgun matches the murder weapon, while the notebook contains writings showing Mangione's disdain for health insurers and plans to kill a CEO. The defense also argued that the officer's initial concern about a bomb in the bag was not a valid reason for a warrantless search, especially since the restaurant was not cleared of civilians. The gun and silencer were found later at the police station, followed by the notebook. A search warrant was later obtained for the bag. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to murder charges.
