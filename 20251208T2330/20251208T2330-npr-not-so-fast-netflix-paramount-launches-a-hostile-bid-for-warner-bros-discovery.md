## Article summary
Paramount Global, led by CEO David Ellison, has launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery with an all-cash offer of $108 billion. This offer significantly surpasses the $83 billion deal Netflix recently announced for Warner's streaming service and studios. The acquisition by Paramount, which is owned by Larry and David Ellison, would create a major Hollywood entity to compete with Netflix, Amazon, Apple, and Disney. Paramount executives stated that Warner had not engaged meaningfully with their previous proposals. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos expressed confidence in their existing deal, anticipating Paramount's counterbid. Despite Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav's reluctance, the Ellisons believe their premium offer for the entire enterprise gives them an advantage. They have also cultivated ties with President Trump, whose administration's approval would be necessary for such a merger. However, Trump has expressed mixed feelings about the Netflix deal and recently criticized CBS News, owned by Paramount, for a "60 Minutes" interview. Antitrust regulators would review the acquisition, but Trump's influence in Washington could play a role in the decision-making process.
