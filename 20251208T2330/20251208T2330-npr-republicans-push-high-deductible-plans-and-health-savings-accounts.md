## Article summary
Republicans are increasingly advocating for high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) and health savings accounts (HSAs) as an alternative to Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. This approach, supported by figures like Senator Bill Cassidy and former President Donald Trump, aims to give individuals more control over healthcare costs by sending government funds directly to HSAs. The idea is that with "skin in the game," consumers will seek lower-cost, higher-quality care. However, the reality has been different, with deductibles rising significantly over the past two decades while medical prices have also skyrocketed. Millions of Americans, even those with insurance, are now burdened by substantial medical debt. Stories like Sarah Monroe's, who accrued over $13,000 in medical debt despite having an HDHP and HSA, highlight the challenges. Monroe found it impractical to shop for care during a serious illness and childbirth, and the funds in her HSA were insufficient for her extensive medical bills. Experts like oncologist Fumiko Chino argue that expecting patients with serious illnesses to compare prices is unrealistic and can lead to devastating financial consequences. Research even suggests a link between HDHPs and increased mortality risk for cancer patients. Critics argue that the HDHP model, intended to control costs and empower patients, has instead led to widespread financial hardship and poorer health outcomes for many.
