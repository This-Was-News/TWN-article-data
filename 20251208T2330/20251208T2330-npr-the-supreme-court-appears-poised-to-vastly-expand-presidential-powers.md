## Article summary
The Supreme Court is considering a case that could significantly expand presidential powers by potentially overturning a 90-year-old precedent. The case centers on President Trump's removal of Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an independent agency. The precedent, established in Humphrey's Executor, limits a president's ability to fire officials from such agencies, requiring cause like "inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office." During oral arguments, conservative justices appeared open to revisiting this precedent, questioning its relevance to modern agencies like the FTC, which they noted wield more executive power today. Conversely, liberal justices expressed concern that overturning the precedent would undermine Congress's ability to create independent government structures. The Trump administration argues that the Humphrey's Executor decision was flawed and that allowing at-will removal would increase accountability to the public. This case follows previous instances where Trump removed members from other independent agencies, and a recent lower court ruling suggested that agencies with significant executive powers might be subject to presidential removal. The Supreme Court's decision could reshape the balance of power between the executive branch and independent agencies, with further deliberations scheduled on a related case involving the Federal Reserve.
