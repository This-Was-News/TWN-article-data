## Article summary
President Donald Trump has announced a $12 billion aid package for American farmers who have been significantly impacted by his trade war with China. This initiative aims to provide financial support to farmers struggling with rising costs and reduced crop sales due to increased tariffs. The aid package includes one-time payments totaling $11 billion for row-crop farmers, with an additional $1 billion set aside for specialty crops. Trump stated that the funds for this program will be derived from tariff revenues. Farmers, while appreciative of the assistance, express that it is a temporary solution and emphasize the need for stable markets and profitability rather than reliance on government aid. The trade dispute has particularly affected soybean and sorghum exports, with China, a major buyer, shifting purchases to other countries. The aid package's value is comparable to the total U.S. soybean exports to China in 2024. Farmers are concerned about the long-term viability of their operations, especially younger farmers and those who rent land. Some farmers are taking measures like selling equipment or seeking additional work to cope with financial pressures. Despite the challenges, some remain optimistic about the industry's resilience. In addition to the farm aid, Trump has also addressed soaring beef prices and signed an executive order to investigate anti-competitive practices in food supply chains.
