## Article summary
President Trump is launching a $12 billion bailout package to assist farmers who have been negatively impacted by his trade war policies. This relief measure comes after China, a major buyer of American farm products like soybeans, retaliated against U.S. tariffs by boycotting U.S. agricultural goods. The administration acknowledges that Trump's trade policies have had adverse effects on the American agriculture sector. The bailout funds will primarily be distributed through the Agriculture Department's Farmer Bridge Assistance program, benefiting farmers of corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, rice, cattle, wheat, and potatoes. This intervention highlights the challenges of Trump's trade strategy, which uses tariffs as a negotiating tool. American farmers have expressed concerns about facing their worst crisis since the 1980s as China has shifted its sourcing to countries like Brazil and Argentina. The White House has attributed some of the blame to former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., while asserting that Trump's actions are necessary for achieving fairer global trade. A White House spokeswoman stated that the president is committed to supporting farmers through new trade deals and by strengthening the farm safety net.
