Meanwhile, Republican senators are proposing alternative healthcare plans as a vote looms on extending Obamacare subsidies, though these proposals face an uphill battle. President Trump has also announced a $12 billion bailout package for farmers struggling with the fallout of his trade war, particularly the retaliatory tariffs from China.
