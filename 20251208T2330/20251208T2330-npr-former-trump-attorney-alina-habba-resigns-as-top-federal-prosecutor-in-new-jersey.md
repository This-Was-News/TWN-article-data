## Article summary
Alina Habba, former personal attorney for President Trump, has resigned as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey following an appeals court ruling that found her serving in the role unlawfully. Habba stated her resignation was to "protect the stability and integrity" of the U.S. attorney's office, and she will remain at the Justice Department as a senior advisor. This departure occurs amid a series of court cases where U.S. attorneys have been found not to have been appointed legally. Habba initially gained prominence defending Trump in civil and criminal cases. After Trump's return to the White House, he appointed Habba as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, but she failed to secure Senate confirmation for a permanent role. A subsequent legal battle and a unanimous ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit disqualified her from supervising cases, causing significant disruptions in New Jersey federal courts. Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized the ruling, calling it politically motivated and stating the department would seek further review.
