## Article summary
Bruce Blakeman, the Republican executive of Nassau County, is expected to announce his candidacy for New York governor on Tuesday. This move sets the stage for a contentious Republican primary race, as Blakeman is an ally of former President Donald Trump, as is U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik, who announced her bid last month. Trump has stated that both Blakeman and Stefanik are "great people" and has not yet endorsed either candidate. Blakeman has garnered attention for his policy banning transgender athletes from county sports facilities and for establishing a volunteer law enforcement unit criticized as a militia. He has also directed county detectives to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Stefanik, who represents a conservative district in northern New York, launched her campaign after Trump withdrew her nomination for UN ambassador. A spokesperson for Stefanik's campaign stated that she is the stronger candidate and that Blakeman's entry into the race may inadvertently benefit Governor Kathy Hochul. Hochul, a Democrat, is running for reelection and is also facing a primary challenge from her lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.
