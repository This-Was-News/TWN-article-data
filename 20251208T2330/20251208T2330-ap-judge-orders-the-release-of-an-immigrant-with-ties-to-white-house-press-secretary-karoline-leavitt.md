## Article summary
An immigration judge has ordered the release of Bruna Ferreira, a 33-year-old Brazilian woman with family ties to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, from ICE custody. Ferreira, a longtime Massachusetts resident, was previously engaged to Leavitt's brother, Michael, and is the mother of their 11-year-old son. She was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Revere, Massachusetts, on November 12 while driving to pick up her son. Ferreira was subsequently moved to a detention facility in Louisiana, where the judge ordered her release on a $1,500 bond. Her attorney argued that she posed neither a danger nor a flight risk, and the government agreed, waiving any appeal. The Department of Homeland Security had previously labeled Ferreira a "criminal illegal alien" and alleged she had been arrested for battery, claims her attorney denied. Ferreira reportedly came to the U.S. as a toddler and was participating in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program while applying for a green card. Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Karoline Leavitt responded to requests for comment.
