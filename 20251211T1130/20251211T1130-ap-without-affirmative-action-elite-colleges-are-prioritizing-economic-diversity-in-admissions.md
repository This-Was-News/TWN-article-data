## Article summary
In the absence of affirmative action, elite U.S. colleges are increasingly prioritizing economic diversity in their admissions processes, leading to record enrollment of low-income students. Universities like Princeton and MIT are implementing strategies such as offering free tuition for families below certain income thresholds and increasing recruitment in underserved urban and rural areas. This shift aims to attract a wider range of talent, though it has faced scrutiny from the Trump administration, which suggested it could be an illegal form of racial proxy. While these efforts are boosting socioeconomic diversity, many institutions are observing a concurrent decrease in racial diversity, as not all minority students are low-income and not all majority students lack financial means. Some colleges, like Amherst, have also stopped prioritizing children of alumni and donors to foster greater economic inclusivity. The College Board's discontinuation of a service providing neighborhood earnings data to admissions offices is seen by some as a retreat due to government pressure. Despite these challenges, researchers advocate for class-based affirmative action, highlighting the importance of including individuals who have faced economic hardships in leadership roles derived from selective colleges. Swarthmore College saw a significant increase in Pell-eligible students by proactively addressing financial aid forms and reducing campus costs, yet also experienced a drop in Black enrollment. The trend suggests that while economic diversity is a growing focus, maintaining racial diversity in a race-neutral admissions environment remains a complex challenge for elite institutions.
