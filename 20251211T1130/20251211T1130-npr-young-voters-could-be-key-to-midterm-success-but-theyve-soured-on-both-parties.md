## Article summary
Young voters, comprising a significant and growing portion of the electorate, are expressing dissatisfaction with both major political parties ahead of the midterm elections. A new poll from the University of Chicago's GenForward survey reveals that nearly 60% of young Americans disapprove of President Trump's job performance, a notable decrease from the previous year. The survey also indicates a substantial drop in support for Democrats, with approximately six in ten young people holding unfavorable views of both parties. This political disillusionment is strongly linked to economic concerns, particularly the high cost of living, with issues like housing, food, and healthcare affordability being top priorities. Many young adults worry about their financial future, with a significant portion concerned about paying rent or mortgages and believing they will be worse off than their parents. This sentiment is exacerbated by rising housing costs outpacing wages and higher rates of student loan and mortgage debt among Gen Z and millennials. While Democrats hold an early advantage on a generic congressional ballot, a considerable number of young voters are open to third parties, with over 80% agreeing that more political choices are needed due to the poor performance of the two major parties. This distrust in institutions is tied to economic anxieties, as young Americans emphasize that affordability is crucial for their ability to be full citizens and participate effectively in democracy.
