## Article summary
Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado believes the government was unaware of her whereabouts during her 11-month period in hiding. She arrived in Oslo to meet with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, a day after her daughter accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Machado, who mounted a significant peaceful challenge to President Nicolás Maduro's government, was awarded the prize in October. She expressed gratitude to those who risked their lives for her to be in Norway, stating she would reveal the details of her journey later to protect them. Machado affirmed her commitment to fighting for Venezuela's freedom and indicated she would employ clandestine methods to remain safe upon her return if Maduro's government is still in power. Her participation in the upcoming presidential election was blocked by the government, leading to widespread repression and the eventual disqualification of her candidacy. Despite these challenges, Machado remains resolute in her fight for a free Venezuela.
