## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the United States has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, escalating tensions with President Nicolás Maduro's government. This action, involving U.S. forces taking control of a merchant ship, is highly unusual and represents the latest effort by the Trump administration to pressure Maduro, who faces U.S. narcoterrorism charges. The U.S. has significantly increased its military presence in the region and conducted strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats. Trump stated the tanker, identified as the Skipper, was seized for a "very good reason" and that the U.S. would keep the oil. The seizure was led by the U.S. Coast Guard, supported by the Navy, and conducted under U.S. law enforcement authority. Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated the tanker had been sanctioned for its role in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations. Venezuela's government condemned the seizure as "blatant theft" and "international piracy," asserting it was an attempt to seize their natural resources. The seized oil tanker was previously known as the M/T Adisa and was sanctioned in 2022 for allegedly smuggling crude oil for Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah. Some lawmakers, like Senator Chris Van Hollen, expressed skepticism about the administration's stated reasons for military operations, suggesting the seizure indicates a focus on regime change rather than drug interdiction. Naval historian Vincent P. OHara described the seizure as "very unusual and provocative," potentially deterring maritime traffic and impacting Venezuela's economy. This incident follows recent U.S. military flights near Venezuelan airspace and comes amid growing scrutiny from Congress regarding the administration's campaign of boat strikes, which have resulted in civilian casualties and raised legal questions.
