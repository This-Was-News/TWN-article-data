## Article summary
The oil tanker seized by the United States off Venezuela's coast may have been deliberately falsifying its location, according to an analysis of satellite data by The New York Times. While the vessel's transponder indicated it was near Guyana, it was actually docked in Venezuela loading oil, a fact confirmed by satellite imagery and a photograph from TankerTrackers.com. This ship, identified as the Skipper, has a history of transporting oil from sanctioned countries like Iran and Venezuela. Data suggests it has carried nearly 13 million barrels of Iranian and Venezuelan oil since 2021. The Skipper previously delivered Iranian oil to Syria and transported crude oil from Iran to China. In 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the vessel, identifying it as part of an oil smuggling network supporting Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. The seizure operation was documented in a social media post by Attorney General Pam Bondi, showing helicopters and armed personnel boarding the tanker.
