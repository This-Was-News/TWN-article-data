## Article summary
President Trump has dismissed the affordability crisis as a "hoax" perpetrated by Democrats, despite rising prices for many goods and services. This assertion contradicts consumer experiences and official economic data, which show inflation at 3% over the past year, with grocery and electricity costs notably increasing. Experts like economist Betsey Stevenson state that Trump's claims are false, as policies like tariffs are contributing to higher prices by restricting supply. While gasoline prices have fallen, the overall cost of living continues to climb, with consumers spending less on major purchases. Polls indicate that a majority of voters believe Trump is losing the battle against inflation, and many view the economy as poor. Political consultant Frank Luntz warns that Trump risks appearing out of touch by denying the reality of increased costs. This sentiment is particularly concerning for Republicans as the midterm elections approach, especially after Democrats campaigning on affordability won key races in November. Although the Trump administration has taken some steps to mitigate tariff impacts, such as removing them on certain imported goods and providing payments to farmers, the core issue of rising prices remains a significant challenge for his administration.
