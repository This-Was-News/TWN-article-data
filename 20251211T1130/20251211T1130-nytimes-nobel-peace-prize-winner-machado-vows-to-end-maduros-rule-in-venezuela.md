## Article summary
Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, has vowed to end President Nicolás Maduro's rule and bring democracy to Venezuela. She reappeared on the global stage in Oslo, speaking alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, as the Trump administration intensified its pressure campaign against Maduro. This included the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker. Machado, a supporter of Trump's actions, accused Maduro's government of engaging in a vast array of illegal activities with adversaries, including hosting Russian and Iranian agents, and terrorist groups. While she did not comment on potential U.S. military action, she reiterated the administration's stance on Maduro's regime. Venezuela has economic ties with Iran, China, and Russia, and sells most of its oil to China, though evidence of Hezbollah and Hamas presence is inconclusive. Chevron, an American company, continues to export Venezuelan oil to the U.S. Machado supports cutting off funding to Maduro's government, citing gold smuggling, human trafficking, drugs, and illegal oil sales as his financing methods. She arrived in Oslo after her daughter accepted the Nobel Prize on her behalf, and expressed deep emotion at reuniting with her children after over a year apart.
