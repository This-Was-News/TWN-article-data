## Article summary
President Donald Trump has launched a new 'gold card' program, which offers a pathway to U.S. citizenship for individuals and corporations making significant investments. Individuals can obtain legal status and eventual citizenship by investing $1 million, while corporations must invest $2 million per foreign employee. This program aims to replace the existing EB-5 visa system, which was created to encourage foreign investment. Trump stated that the funds generated will go directly to the U.S. government, potentially bringing billions into the Treasury Department. He emphasized that this 'green card, but much better' program is designed to attract and retain top global talent, particularly graduates from U.S. universities who might otherwise be unable to stay and work in the country. Unlike the current EB-5 program, the gold card initiative, as presented by Trump, does not mention specific job creation requirements or overall program caps. This initiative contrasts with Trump's broader immigration policies, which have focused on stricter border control and deportations. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that applicant vetting will be rigorous, with a $15,000 fee for background checks, and that companies can receive multiple cards for individuals. The program is similar to 'golden visa' schemes offered by numerous other countries worldwide. Trump expressed confidence that the program will bring 'tremendous people' into the United States, specifically mentioning top graduates from countries like China, India, and France.
