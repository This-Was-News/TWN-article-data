## Article summary
President Donald Trump announced that the United States has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, escalating tensions with President Nicolás Maduro's government. This action, involving the U.S. Coast Guard and Navy, is part of the administration's increased pressure on Maduro, who faces U.S. narcoterrorism charges. The seized tanker, identified as the Skipper, was reportedly involved in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations. Venezuela's government condemned the seizure as "blatant theft and an act of international piracy," asserting it is motivated by a desire for Venezuela's natural resources. The Skipper departed Venezuela carrying approximately 2 million barrels of heavy crude, with a portion belonging to a Cuban state-run importer. This tanker was previously sanctioned in 2022 for allegedly smuggling oil for Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah. The seizure occurs amid a broader U.S. military buildup in the region and a campaign of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, which is facing scrutiny from Congress. Critics, including Senator Chris Van Hollen, suggest the military operations are aimed at regime change rather than drug interdiction. Naval historian Vincent P. O'Hara described the seizure as "very unusual" and "provocative," potentially impacting Venezuela's economy by deterring maritime traffic.
