## Article summary
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is strongly opposing a provision in a defense authorization bill that could undermine aviation safety improvements. These improvements were recommended following a deadly mid-air collision in January near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which killed 67 people. NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy called the provision a "safety whitewash" and expressed anger that it would recreate conditions similar to those that led to the fatal crash. The NTSB had secured an agreement with the Defense Department to require military aircraft to broadcast their position using ADS-B technology after the collision. However, the bill's language reportedly includes exemptions that could negate this policy. Homendy stated that the NTSB "vehemently" opposes this rollback and has communicated these concerns to congressional leaders. While some committee leaders defend the bill's language, asserting it ensures warnings of aircraft positions, other lawmakers share the NTSB's concerns. These senators argue the bill maintains outdated requirements for military aircraft and are advocating for the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would mandate ADS-B technology and limit exemptions. Families of the victims also expressed disappointment, urging Congress to strengthen the provision to protect the public and ensure accountability.
