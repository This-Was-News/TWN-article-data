## Article summary
Abbott Diabetes Care has issued a warning regarding faulty glucose readings from some of its FreeStyle Libre 3 and FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus sensors. These devices, potentially affecting around 3 million units, have been linked to seven deaths and hundreds of serious injuries. Internal testing revealed that a single production line caused the issue, leading to incorrect low glucose readings. Abbott advises customers to immediately discontinue use of affected sensors and dispose of them, as undetected incorrect readings can result in dangerous treatment decisions for individuals with diabetes, potentially leading to injury or death. While seven deaths were reported outside the U.S., 57 severe injuries occurred within the United States. Abbott has stated that they are continuing production and do not anticipate significant supply disruptions. Customers can check their sensor's status and receive replacements at no charge by visiting FreeStyleCheck.com. The Food and Drug Administration also provides further information on this recall.
