## Article summary
The National Park Service has announced a new schedule for free admission days, which will include President Donald Trump's birthday on Flag Day but will eliminate free entry for Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth. This change, effective January 1, has been criticized as an attempt by the Trump administration to downplay civil rights history while promoting the president's image. Juneteenth commemorates the emancipation of the last enslaved Americans, and MLK Day is a significant civil rights holiday often used for community service projects in parks. Civil rights leaders and Democratic lawmakers have expressed strong opposition, viewing the decision as racially motivated and a disregard for Black history and the struggles for freedom. The Park Service has not yet provided a reason for these changes. This move follows a pattern of actions by the administration to eliminate diversity-promoting programs and downplay America's history of racism and civil rights victories. The president has a history of seeking self-promotion, including attempts to have his name or image associated with various institutions and honors.
