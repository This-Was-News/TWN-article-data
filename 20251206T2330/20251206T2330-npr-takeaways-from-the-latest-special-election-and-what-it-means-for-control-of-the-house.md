## Article summary
Recent special elections indicate a potential wave of Democratic support in 2026, threatening Republican control of the House of Representatives. Despite a Republican win in a Tennessee special election, their margin of victory significantly decreased compared to previous elections, mirroring a national trend of Democrats outperforming expectations. This trend is further supported by an average 14-point improvement for Democrats in recent elections. Republicans are attempting to counter this by leveraging mid-decade redistricting, a strategy bolstered by a recent Supreme Court decision allowing a new Texas congressional map to proceed, despite accusations of racial gerrymandering. This new map is intended to secure five additional seats for the GOP. However, Democrats are pursuing their own redistricting efforts in states like California and Virginia, and a new map in Utah is expected to yield an additional Democratic seat. The economic climate presents a significant challenge for Republicans, with widespread public dissatisfaction regarding the cost of living and inflation. Polls indicate a negative view of President Trump's handling of the economy, with a majority of Latinos and a substantial portion of Trump voters expressing concern. This economic sentiment, coupled with public perception of tariffs increasing prices, suggests a difficult path for Republican candidates. Even Republican candidates are acknowledging the economic concerns, though their messaging has not yet overcome the broader trends. The current economic tide, combined with a notable number of Republican retirements from the House, points towards a potentially challenging election cycle for the party.
