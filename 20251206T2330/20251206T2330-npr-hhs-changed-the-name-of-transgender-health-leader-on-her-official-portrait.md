## Article summary
Admiral Rachel Levine's official portrait at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had her name changed to a previous one during the federal shutdown. Levine, the first transgender person to receive Senate confirmation for a high-ranking position at HHS, served as the assistant secretary for health. Her spokesperson called the alteration an "act of bigotry." An HHS spokesperson stated their priority is ensuring "gold standard science" and that "biological reality guides" their public health approach, implying a reversal of policies enacted under Levine. An anonymous HHS staff member described the change as "disrespectful" and indicative of "erasure of transgender individuals." This incident occurs in the context of political rhetoric and actions against transgender rights. Levine herself stated it was an "honor to serve" and declined to comment on the "petty action." Her spokesperson highlighted her significant public health work and urged current leaders to focus on pressing public health issues rather than "vindictive" actions.
