## Article summary
Russia launched a massive overnight drone and missile attack across Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure and causing widespread power outages. Ukrainian forces reported shooting down a significant portion of the incoming threats, but at least eight people were wounded. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost its off-site power, raising concerns about nuclear safety. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that energy facilities were the primary targets, and a drone strike also damaged a train station. Meanwhile, Russia claimed to have intercepted numerous Ukrainian drones over its territory, with reports of a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery. These attacks occur as diplomatic talks continue in Florida between U.S. officials and a Ukrainian delegation, aimed at finding a framework for peace. President Zelenskyy reported a substantive call with U.S. and Ukrainian officials involved in these negotiations. Both sides acknowledge that any lasting peace agreement will depend on Russia's commitment. Separately, leaders from the UK, France, and Germany are scheduled to meet with President Zelenskyy in London.
