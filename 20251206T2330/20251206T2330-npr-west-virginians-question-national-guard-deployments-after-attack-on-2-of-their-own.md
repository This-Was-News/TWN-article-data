## Article summary
In West Virginia, the National Guard has historically been viewed as both a patriotic duty and a vital economic resource, especially in poorer regions. This perspective is being re-examined following the deaths of Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and the wounding of Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, who were attacked while on duty in Washington D.C. as part of President Trump's National Guard deployments. These deployments, intended to combat crime, have faced legal challenges and growing scrutiny, even within West Virginia, a state that has heavily supported Trump. For many young West Virginians, the Guard offers crucial financial benefits, including college funding, pay, and bonuses, serving as a pathway to opportunities scarce in their hometowns. The incident has sparked debate about the rationale behind sending troops to D.C. for tasks that some report as menial rather than security-focused. While Governor Morrisey maintains unwavering support for the Guard's service, critics argue the deployment was a politically motivated risk that placed soldiers in harm's way. The loss of Beckstrom and Wolfe has deeply affected their communities, highlighting the personal cost of these deployments and prompting questions about their true purpose and necessity.
