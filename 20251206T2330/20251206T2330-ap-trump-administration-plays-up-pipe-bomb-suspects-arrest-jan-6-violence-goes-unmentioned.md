## Article summary
The Trump administration highlighted the arrest of a man accused of planting pipe bombs outside Republican and Democratic party headquarters, issuing a stern warning against attacking national institutions. However, officials remained silent about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot that occurred the day prior, a pattern seen as an effort to downplay or rewrite the events of that day. This disconnect is evident in the administration's actions, such as pardons for rioters and the dismissal of prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases, despite the significant violence against law enforcement. FBI Director Kash Patel, who previously referred to Jan. 6 rioters as political prisoners, now emphasizes the FBI's commitment to combating threats to the nation's capital. His deputy, Dan Bongino, who once suggested the pipe bomb incident was an inside job, now calls the investigation a top priority. The suspect, Brian Cole Jr., reportedly believed conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being stolen from Trump. This stance contrasts sharply with the confirmed lack of widespread fraud in the election. The administration's approach to the Jan. 6 aftermath, including pardons for individuals accused of attacking officers and personnel changes within the Justice Department, has drawn criticism for its selective enforcement and apparent attempt to mitigate the severity of the Capitol riot.
