## Article summary
President Donald Trump presented medals to the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in an Oval Office ceremony, calling them perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class ever assembled. The recipients include actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss, and actor-singer Michael Crawford. Trump, who stated he was a fan of all the honorees, personally announced the slate of artists in August, marking a shift from the traditional selection process. He also instituted changes at the Kennedy Center, including replacing its board of trustees and vowing to overhaul its programming and appearance. The new medals, designed and donated by Tiffany & Co., feature a gold disc with the Kennedy Center's image and the honoree's name. Previously, honorees received their medallions at a State Department dinner, but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House. The Kennedy Center Honors program and tribute performances are scheduled to be taped for broadcast later in December. Trump is set to attend the program for the first time as president and has indicated he will also host the show, a departure from presidential tradition. He previously spent time at the Kennedy Center on Friday, participating in the FIFA World Cup draw and accepting an inaugural peace prize.
