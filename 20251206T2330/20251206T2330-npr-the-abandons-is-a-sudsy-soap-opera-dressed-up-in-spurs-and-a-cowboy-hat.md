## Article summary
The Abandons is a new Netflix Western series set in the 1850s Washington Territory, featuring a large ensemble cast and a complex web of characters. The story primarily revolves around two powerful matriarchs: Constance Van Ness, a wealthy mining magnate, and Fiona Nolan, a struggling rancher. Constance desires Fiona's land, sparking a conflict that drives the narrative. The series is characterized by its explicit dialogue, where characters often state their thoughts and intentions directly, seemingly to assist viewers and prevent them from using external resources. Despite its Western setting with elements of banditry and stark landscapes, the show's core is a glitzy soap opera akin to Dynasty, focusing on intrigue, betrayal, and petty schemes. Lena Headey and Gillian Anderson deliver strong performances as the central figures, Fiona and Constance, respectively, portraying them as complex women with clear, albeit often negative, motivations. The conflict between them is depicted in black-and-white terms, with Fiona as a flawed hero and Constance as a villain. While the season builds tension effectively, it concludes on a cliffhanger, leaving the overarching conflict unresolved. Ultimately, The Abandons offers an entertaining, albeit sudsy, viewing experience within a Western guise.
