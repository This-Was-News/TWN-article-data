## Article summary
Western Washington state is experiencing catastrophic flooding due to back-to-back atmospheric rivers that brought heavy rains and strong winds. Tens of thousands of Washingtonians remain under evacuation advisories, with approximately 78,000 people in Skagit County's flood plain affected. Images depict the widespread impact, showing overflowing rivers inundating streets, farms, and homes in areas like Burlington, Lyman, and Monroe. National Guard members have been deployed to assist with evacuations, and residents are seen rescuing animals and fortifying their homes. In Chehalis, families are being evacuated by rescue boats. The flooding has forced rivers to burst their banks, leading to widespread disruption across the region. Flood watches and warnings are still in effect for Western Washington as the situation develops.
