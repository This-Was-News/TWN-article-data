## Article summary
The Trump administration has initiated a program where the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shares air passenger data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to facilitate deportations. This previously undisclosed initiative involves the TSA providing lists of travelers multiple times a week to ICE, which then cross-references this information with its database of individuals subject to deportation. The goal is to increase cooperation between federal agencies to carry out President Trump's objective of a large-scale deportation campaign. This program has led to arrests, including that of Any Lucía López Belloza, a college student who was detained at Boston Logan Airport and deported to Honduras. While the TSA historically avoided involvement in domestic immigration matters, this collaboration began in March and is seen by some as a way to turn routine travel into an opportunity for removals. Critics argue that this program is intended to terrorize immigrant communities and discourage travel. The effectiveness of the program is highlighted by the swiftness with which individuals can be apprehended and deported, as seen in Ms. López's case. This effort is part of a broader trend of the administration leveraging various databases to track and detain immigrants.
