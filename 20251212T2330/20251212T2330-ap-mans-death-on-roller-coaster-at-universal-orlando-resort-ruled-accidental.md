## Article summary
The death of a 32-year-old man, Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, after riding a roller coaster at Universal Epic Universe theme park has been ruled accidental by the Orange County Sheriff's Office. A medical examiner's report detailed significant blunt-impact injuries, including a fractured forehead, fractured nose, and fractured thigh bone. Security footage showed Zavala was engaged at the start of the ride but unresponsive by the end. Witnesses described him bleeding from the face and slumped over with a broken thigh bone. Zavala's girlfriend noted that the lap restraint may have been positioned too low and that he hit his head multiple times during the ride. The family stated that Zavala's pre-existing condition, spinal cord atrophy, did not cause his death. Ride operators reportedly had difficulty releasing the lap bar for ten minutes after the ride concluded. Warning signs at the ride's entrance advised patrons with certain physical conditions, including back or neck issues or recent surgeries, against riding. The Stardust Racers roller coaster, which reaches speeds up to 62 mph, debuted in May as part of Universal Orlando Resort's newest park.
