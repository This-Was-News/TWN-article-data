## Article summary
House Democrats have released a selection of photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, including images of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew. These photos are part of a larger collection of over 95,000 items received from Epstein's estate. The release comes as anticipation grows for the Department of Justice to release its own Epstein files. The photos were released without captions and some showed Trump with unidentified women, while another featured Bill Clinton with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats stated their commitment to redacting any information that could harm victims. Republicans accused Democrats of selectively releasing photos to create a false narrative. Many of the released photos have previously circulated publicly. Democrats plan to release more photos in the coming weeks to pressure Trump's administration regarding its earlier refusal to release documents. Donald Trump has stated he had no knowledge of Epstein's crimes and had parted ways with him long before the charges. Bill Clinton has also minimized his relationship with Epstein, stating he had no knowledge of the financier's crimes and has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's victims. Republicans on the House committee are pushing for the Clintons to testify. Prince Andrew lost his royal titles amid revelations of his ties to Epstein. The released photos also included images of Steve Bannon, Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Woody Allen, Larry Summers, and Alan Dershowitz, all of whom have denied wrongdoing in their associations with Epstein. Some lawmakers believe that more high-profile figures could be implicated if the full Justice Department files are released.
