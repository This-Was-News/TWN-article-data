## Article summary
The Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, has filed lawsuits against 18 states, primarily Democratic-led states that President Trump lost in the 2020 election, seeking access to sensitive voter data. The DOJ claims it needs this information, including driver's license and partial Social Security numbers, to verify compliance with federal laws regarding accurate voter rolls. However, most states have refused, citing privacy concerns. The latest states sued are Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Nevada. In addition to these states, the DOJ is also suing Georgia's Fulton County for 2020 election records, a county that has been central to baseless claims of election rigging by Trump and his allies. Colorado officials, like Secretary of State Jena Griswold, are actively pushing back against the administration's pursuit of voter data, asserting that sensitive information should not be handed over. This legal action against Colorado occurs as Trump announced a pardon for Tina Peters, a former county clerk convicted for unauthorized access to voting equipment, though the pardon may be symbolic as the conviction was on state charges. The Justice Department has also initiated a review of Colorado's prisons.
