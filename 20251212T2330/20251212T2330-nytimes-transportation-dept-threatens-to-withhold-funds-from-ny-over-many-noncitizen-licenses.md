## Article summary
The Trump administration is threatening to withhold $73 million in federal highway funds from New York unless the state revokes commercial driver's licenses issued to noncitizens without work authorization. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called New York the "worst offender" for issuing these licenses, citing a federal audit where over half of sampled non-domiciled commercial licenses were held by individuals lacking proper work authorization. The state has 30 days to respond, or it could also lose its certification to issue any commercial driver's licenses. New York's Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman Walter McClure accused federal officials of lying and stated that the state complies with federal rules. He characterized the threat as a "stunt" that doesn't improve road safety. The federal government's criticism is based on an audit of 200 licenses, questioning New York's verification process for the approximately 32,000 active non-domiciled commercial license holders. Federal officials also pointed out that New York issues eight-year licenses, even if applicants' work visas are shorter. New York maintains that it verifies lawful status through federally issued documents. This action follows similar pressure on California, which agreed to revoke 17,000 licenses. The administration's broader effort aims to prevent undocumented immigrants from obtaining commercial licenses, especially after a fatal crash in Florida involving an immigrant with a California-issued license. Secretary Duffy defended the focus on New York and California, stating they issue over half of the nation's non-domiciled commercial licenses, posing a risk to all states.
