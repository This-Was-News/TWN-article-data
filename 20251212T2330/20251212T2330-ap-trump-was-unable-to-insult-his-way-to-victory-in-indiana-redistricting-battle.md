## Article summary
Indiana Republican senators rejected a proposed congressional map that would have benefited the GOP, defying pressure from President Donald Trump. Trump's attempts to influence the vote through social media attacks and direct appeals to senators backfired, with many lawmakers citing his "nasty" and "coarse" language as reasons for their opposition. Senators stated that their constituents did not want the new districts, which were seen by some as an attempt to dilute Democratic influence. Despite a "full-court press" from the White House, including calls from Vice President JD Vance, the proposed map was defeated. Some senators felt Trump's tactics were akin to bullying, and that his threats to primary opponents were misplaced. The rejection represents a significant political defeat for Trump's national strategy to redraw congressional maps. Indiana's Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith criticized the senators' decision, but lawmakers maintained they were listening to their voters. The proposed map would have divided Indianapolis and altered districts across the state. Ultimately, the senators' decision was based on constituent opposition and a dislike for external pressure.
