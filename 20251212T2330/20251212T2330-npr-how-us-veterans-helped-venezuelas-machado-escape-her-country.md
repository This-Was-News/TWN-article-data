## Article summary
María Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from Venezuela, was successfully whisked out of the country in a daring nighttime maritime operation orchestrated by U.S. veterans. Machado had been in hiding for over a year after her opposition movement won an election widely considered fraudulent against President Nicolás Maduro. The extraction, codenamed Operation Golden Dynamite, was planned by Bryan Stern, founder of Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, and his team of U.S. military veterans. Due to security concerns and numerous checkpoints, a sea route was chosen over land. The operation involved navigating treacherous conditions, including 10-foot waves and darkness, as the team met Machado at sea after their initial rendezvous point proved inaccessible. Stern described Machado as remarkably resilient during the escape, enduring the harsh conditions without complaint. She was then transported by private plane to Oslo to receive her Nobel Peace Prize. Stern expressed admiration for Machado, noting her toughness and calling her 'pretty awesome'.
