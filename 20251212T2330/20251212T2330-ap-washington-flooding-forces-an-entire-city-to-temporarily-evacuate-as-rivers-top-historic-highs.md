## Article summary
Severe flooding in western Washington has forced the evacuation of the entire city of Burlington, home to nearly 10,000 people, as rivers have reached historic highs. An atmospheric river event brought over a foot of rain to the Cascade Mountains, causing rivers like the Skagit to swell and overflow. National Guard troops went door-to-door to assist residents, with some families stranded on rooftops and homes ripped from their foundations. While dozens of water rescues have occurred, no deaths have been reported as of Friday afternoon. The Skagit River crested at a record high in Mount Vernon, though a flood wall protected the downtown area. Other cities like Sumas, Nooksack, and Everson have also been inundated, with the border crossing at Sumas closed. Authorities are continuing rescue efforts by boat and helicopter. Scientists note that climate change is linked to more intense extreme weather events like this flood. More rain is expected Sunday, which could prolong or renew flooding in the region.
