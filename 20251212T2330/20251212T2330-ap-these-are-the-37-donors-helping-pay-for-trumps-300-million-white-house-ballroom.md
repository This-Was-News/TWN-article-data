## Article summary
President Donald Trump's $300 million White House ballroom project is being funded by 37 donors, including crypto billionaires, tech giants, sports team owners, and financiers. The White House released a list of these donors, though it is noted as incomplete, with some companies preferring anonymity until required by financial disclosure regulations. Among the tech giants contributing are Amazon, Apple, Google, HP, Meta, Micron Technology, Microsoft, and Palantir Technologies. The cryptocurrency sector is represented by donors such as Coinbase, Ripple, Tether, and the Winklevoss twins. Other contributors include companies in the energy and industrial sectors like Caterpillar and NextEra Energy, as well as philanthropic foundations and individuals. The list also features former Trump administration officials and individuals from the communications, entertainment, tobacco, and defense industries. Notably, no foreign individuals or entities are listed as donors. The funding aims to support the construction of a new ballroom at the White House, with some donors having complex or previously contentious relationships with the Trump administration.
