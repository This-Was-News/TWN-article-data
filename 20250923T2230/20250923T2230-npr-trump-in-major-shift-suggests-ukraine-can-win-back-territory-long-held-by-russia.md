## Article summary
President Trump has shifted his stance on Ukraine's territorial claims, now suggesting that Ukraine can win back all territory seized by Russia, including Crimea. This reversal comes after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the U.N. General Assembly. Trump's previous position was that Ukraine might need to cede some territory to end the war. He now believes Ukraine, with support from the EU and NATO, can reclaim all its land. Trump has also expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, even suggesting that NATO should shoot down Russian aircraft intruding into NATO airspace. He has resisted calls for tougher sanctions on Russia, urging European leaders to stop buying Russian oil. Trump criticized NATO members still purchasing Russian energy, calling it inexcusable. Zelenskyy supports Trump's push for NATO members to stop buying Russian energy but noted that not all members are ready to do so. Trump has not yet spoken to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban about cutting off Russian energy imports.
