## Article summary
World leaders gathered at the United Nations to address global issues, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict taking center stage due to growing support for a Palestinian state. The General Assembly's week-long meetings began with a conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, followed by the General Debate where leaders like Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, U.S. President Donald Trump, and others will speak. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock emphasized the need to choose the right path and work together, despite global challenges. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres highlighted ongoing conflicts, rising poverty, and climate change as pressing issues. Several countries, including France and Belgium, recognized a Palestinian state during the conference, while others like Germany and Japan did not. Israel and the U.S. boycotted the event, criticizing the push for a Palestinian state. Trump's return to the Assembly after five years is notable, given his America First policy's tension with the U.N.'s global approach. The U.S. has reduced international aid and withdrawn from some U.N. bodies under Trump's administration. The General Assembly's six-day speechfest includes 89 heads of state and numerous other officials.
