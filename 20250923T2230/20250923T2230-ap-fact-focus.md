## Article summary
President Donald Trump made several claims about autism, Tylenol use during pregnancy, and vaccines, which have been fact-checked. Trump suggested women avoid Tylenol during pregnancy, but medical experts argue there's no proven link between Tylenol and autism. He also claimed autism rates have surged by over 400% since 2000, but his numbers were inaccurate. Studies on Tylenol use during pregnancy are inconclusive, and avoiding it can have serious health risks for pregnant women. Trump's claims about Cuba and the Amish having no autism were also debunked, as both communities have reported cases. He inaccurately stated that the childhood vaccination schedule includes 80 vaccines, when it actually protects against 18 diseases. There is no evidence linking vaccines to autism. Trump's suggestion to delay or space out vaccines was criticized by pediatricians. Finally, his mention of a potential new treatment for autism using leucovorin is not yet proven effective.
