## Article summary
In a lengthy and rambling address to the United Nations, President Trump criticized global institutions, environmentalists, and various countries' policies. He questioned the purpose of the U.N. and aired grievances ranging from a malfunctioning escalator to immigration policies. Trump undermined climate change efforts, calling it a 'con job' and claiming environmentalists want to eliminate cows. He also falsely accused Muslim leaders of planning to institute Sharia law. The speech included policy announcements, such as enforcing the biological weapons convention with A.I. and warning drug smugglers of U.S. military action. Trump praised his role in peace agreements but criticized the U.N. for inaction. He also met with various world leaders, including those from Arab and Muslim countries, amid ongoing conflicts and diplomatic tensions.
