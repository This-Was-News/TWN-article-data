## Article summary
President Trump shifted his stance on the Ukraine-Russia war, now believing Ukraine can regain all lost territory with NATO and U.S. support. This change came after a meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky, who welcomed the shift. Trump criticized Russia as a 'paper tiger' with economic problems and suggested NATO should shoot down Russian aircraft entering allied airspace. At the U.N. General Assembly, Trump criticized the organization's effectiveness, boasted about his achievements, and questioned its purpose amid global conflicts. Other leaders, including France's Macron and Brazil's Lula, offered contrasting views, with Macron emphasizing the U.N.'s importance and Lula critiquing Trump's policies. Meanwhile, Iran's supreme leader rejected negotiations with the U.S. and denied intentions to build nuclear weapons, while European leaders threatened sanctions over Iran's uranium enrichment. Zelensky urged China to pressure Russia to end the war, and Macron had a brief encounter with Trump's motorcade in New York. Trump also attacked climate change policies, calling them a 'con job,' and criticized European renewable energy efforts. The U.N. Security Council discussed the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, with various leaders addressing the conflicts and their impacts.
