## Article summary
Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show is set to return to ABC after a suspension caused by controversial remarks about the Trump administration's response to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. However, major TV station groups Sinclair and Nexstar, which control over 20% of ABC's local affiliates, have decided to boycott the show indefinitely, replacing it with news programming. This boycott has created a high-stakes impasse between Disney, which owns ABC, and the TV station groups, highlighting a debate over free speech. The decision has been met with mixed reactions, with conservatives applauding the move and liberals condemning it. The boycott could lead to backlash from viewers who enjoy Jimmy Kimmel Live! and may undermine the network's business model. The controversy has also drawn attention to the First Amendment and the role of local TV stations in programming decisions. Nexstar, in particular, is navigating this situation carefully as it seeks approval for a $6.2 billion merger that requires FCC approval. Most other local TV groups, such as Gray and Hearst, plan to air Kimmel's show as scheduled. The situation has put Disney in a challenging position, with potential repercussions for its subscriber base and network-affiliate relationships.
