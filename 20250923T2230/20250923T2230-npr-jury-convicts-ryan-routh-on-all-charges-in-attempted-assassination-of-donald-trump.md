## Article summary
A federal jury in Fort Pierce, Florida, convicted Ryan Routh on all five charges, including attempted assassination of Donald Trump and weapons violations. The trial, which lasted two-and-a-half weeks, focused on Routh's alleged plan to shoot Trump at his golf club in West Palm Beach on September 15, 2024. Prosecutors presented 38 witnesses over seven days, detailing Routh's alleged surveillance and preparation. Routh, acting as his own attorney, offered a limited defense, arguing that mere planning does not constitute intent. The jury found that Routh had intent and took substantial steps in the alleged attempt, even though the rifle was never fired. After the verdict, Routh attempted to stab himself but was subdued by U.S. Marshals. His daughter reacted emotionally in the courtroom. The verdict was hailed as a message against political violence. Routh faces up to life in prison when sentenced on December 18. The trial highlighted the seriousness of attempts to assassinate political figures and the justice system's response to such threats.
