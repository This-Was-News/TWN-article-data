## Article summary
Ryan Routh, who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump at a Florida golf course in 2024, was found guilty on all counts after a brief jury deliberation. Immediately after the verdict, Routh tried to stab himself with a pen but failed to injure himself. His daughter screamed in protest as he was dragged from the courtroom. Routh, representing himself, faced charges including attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate and possessing firearms illegally. Prosecutors argued he had plotted the attack for weeks, while Routh claimed he never intended to harm anyone. The trial included testimony from a Secret Service agent who confronted Routh. Routh's sentencing is scheduled for December 18, with a potential life sentence. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche emphasized the verdict's importance in combating political violence. Routh's background includes previous felony convictions and attempts to recruit soldiers for conflicts abroad. Trump expressed appreciation for the justice system's handling of the case.
