## Article summary
A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that infection rates from drug-resistant 'nightmare bacteria' increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The rise is primarily driven by bacteria containing the NDM gene, which are difficult to treat with only two effective antibiotics available. These antibiotics are expensive and must be administered intravenously. Once considered rare, NDM bacteria cases in the U.S. have surged more than fivefold in recent years. Experts warn that many people may unknowingly carry these bacteria, potentially leading to community spread. Routine infections, like urinary tract infections, could become chronic due to this resistance. The misuse of antibiotics, including unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions, has contributed to the problem. The CDC has previously highlighted the danger of nightmare bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics, including carbapenems, which are a last resort for serious infections. The study, based on data from 29 states, identified 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections in 2023, with 1,831 of those being the NDM variety. The increase in resistance is likely linked to the surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the true extent of the problem is underestimated due to limited testing and reporting in many states, including some of the most populous ones.
