## Article summary
ABC has reinstated Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show after suspending it indefinitely due to criticism over his comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The network held conversations with Kimmel and decided to bring the show back on Tuesday. Kimmel's comments targeted President Donald Trump and his supporters for their response to Kirk's death. Two major ABC affiliates, Nexstar and Sinclair, will not air Kimmel's return, representing about 25% of all affiliates. They cited Kimmel's problematic comments regarding Kirk's murder as the reason. Disney and ABC initially suspended the show to avoid inflaming tensions, stating that some comments were ill-timed and insensitive. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel's comments but denied threatening to revoke ABC's licenses. Kimmel had condemned the murder and criticized Trump's response, accusing him of capitalizing on the tragedy. The suspension sparked a debate on free speech, with figures like Barack Obama and Megyn Kelly expressing opposing views. Congressional Democrats introduced a bill to bolster free speech protections, reflecting the controversy surrounding Kimmel's suspension.
