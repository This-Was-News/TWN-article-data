## Article summary
The Trump administration has raised concerns about the use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) during pregnancy, linking it to autism. President Trump advised against its use, but medical experts and the maker of Tylenol disputed this claim, citing insufficient evidence. Research on the topic is mixed, with some studies suggesting a link between acetaminophen and autism or ADHD, while others, particularly a large 2024 study in Sweden, found no causal relationship. Experts emphasize that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy can be dangerous, and acetaminophen remains one of the few safe options for managing these issues. The FDA advises minimizing its use for routine low-grade fevers but acknowledges its safety compared to other medications. Medical professionals urge parents to consult their healthcare providers for guidance, as the scientific community continues to debate the matter. They also stress that correlation does not imply causation, and more research is needed to fully understand any potential risks.
