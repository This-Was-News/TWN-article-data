## Article summary
Starting in 2026, Major League Baseball will allow players to challenge called balls and strikes using the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) system. This system, powered by 12 cameras, will enable batters, pitchers, and catchers to challenge calls by tapping their heads. Each team starts with two challenges, retaining them if overturned and losing them if upheld. The system, tested in minor leagues and spring training, has shown that calls are overturned over half the time. Players and fans have generally favored the challenge system over full automation. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and Seattle Mariners owner John Stanton have praised the system for balancing technology with the human element of the game. The ABS system, developed by Hawk-Eye, has been refined based on feedback from players, umpires, and fans. Replay review has been part of baseball since 2008, but called balls and strikes were previously considered a human element. The challenge system aims to correct missed calls without significantly slowing down the game.
