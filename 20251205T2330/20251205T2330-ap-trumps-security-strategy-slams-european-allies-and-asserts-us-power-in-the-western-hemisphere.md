## Article summary
The Trump administration has unveiled a new national security strategy that criticizes European allies for their migration and free speech policies, suggesting they face "civilizational erasure" and questioning their reliability. The strategy emphasizes an "America First" philosophy, prioritizing U.S. interests and questioning long-standing alliances. It advocates for reasserting American dominance in the Western Hemisphere, drawing parallels to the Monroe Doctrine and outlining potential military actions against drug trafficking and to control migration. Simultaneously, the strategy suggests abandoning efforts to influence Middle Eastern nations' governments and policies, instead encouraging organic reform and viewing the region as a source of economic opportunities. The document also aims to rebalance the U.S.-China relationship, countering Beijing's assertiveness toward Taiwan while urging regional allies to increase their defense contributions. This approach marks a significant departure from the Biden administration's focus on reinvigorating alliances and checking Russian influence. Critics, like Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, have labeled the strategy "catastrophic" and a retreat that will make the world more dangerous.
