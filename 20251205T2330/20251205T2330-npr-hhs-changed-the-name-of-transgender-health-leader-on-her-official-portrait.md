## Article summary
The official portrait of Admiral Rachel Levine, the first transgender person to hold a four-star admiral position at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), was altered during a federal shutdown. Her portrait, displayed in the HHS headquarters hallway, was changed to show her previous name beneath her image. A spokesperson for HHS stated that the change was made by current leadership to ensure information reflects "gold standard science" and that "biological reality guides our approach to public health," indicating a reversal of policies enacted during Levine's tenure. Admiral Levine, who served as the assistant secretary for health, called the action "petty" and declined to comment further. Her former deputy assistant secretary and current spokesperson, Adrian Shanker, condemned the act as "bigotry" and unprecedented, urging current leaders to focus on public health challenges instead of vindictiveness. An HHS staff member anonymously described the change as "disrespectful" and indicative of the "erasure of transgender individuals by this administration." The alteration occurred amidst a political climate where transgender individuals have been a target of anti-transgender campaigns and policy changes by the Trump administration across various federal agencies. Levine's public health work on issues like COVID-19, syphilis, HIV/AIDS, and opioids was also highlighted.
