## Article summary
Federal agents have arrested Brian J. Cole Jr., 30, in connection with the two pipe bombs that were placed near the U.S. Capitol complex the night before the January 6, 2021, attack. Cole allegedly told investigators that he believed conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being stolen from President Trump and expressed support for Trump. The FBI spent years searching for the individual responsible for placing the bombs near the Democratic and Republican committee headquarters. Cole was arrested at his home in Woodbridge, Virginia, and charged with transportation of an explosive device via interstate commerce and attempted malicious destruction by means of an explosive device. The Department of Justice stated that Cole spoke with law enforcement for over four hours after his arrest. The investigation was intensified this year by new leadership at the FBI and the Justice Department. According to court documents, Cole purchased components that could have been used to construct the pipe bombs, and a cell phone linked to him pinged cell towers near the locations of the bombs on the night they were placed. A license plate reader also captured his vehicle in the vicinity. The discovery of the bombs occurred just before the Capitol breach and as fighting intensified, with officials suggesting they may have served as diversionary tactics. FBI Director Kash Patel stated that the suspect will have his day in court.
