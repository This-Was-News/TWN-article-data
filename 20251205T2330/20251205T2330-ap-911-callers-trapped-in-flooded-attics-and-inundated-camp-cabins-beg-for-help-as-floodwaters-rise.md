## Article summary
Hundreds of 911 audio files released from the July 4 floods in the Texas Hill Country reveal the terror of victims trapped by rising waters. Calls detail people clinging to trees, families seeking refuge in attics, and staff pleading for immediate assistance as floodwaters inundated homes and summer camps. One caller from Camp Mystic described the water rising in their room and questioned how they could reach the roof, while another reported a destroyed wall amidst screams. Tragically, 27 people, mostly girls, died at Camp Mystic. Other calls captured individuals trapped in buildings with water nearing their heads, with one dispatcher advising to "try to keep your head above the water." A family in an attic feared they would die as the water approached the windows, with a mother expressing concern for her infant. A firefighter, stranded in a tree, desperately requested a helicopter, fearing he had only minutes to live; he did not survive, though his wife was found alive. Another woman reported her children trapped in an RV trailer that was being carried away by the forceful floodwaters, emphasizing the urgent need for immediate help.
