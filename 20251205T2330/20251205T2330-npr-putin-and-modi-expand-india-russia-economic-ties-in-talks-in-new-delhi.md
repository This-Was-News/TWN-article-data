## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin visited New Delhi for a two-day state visit, marking his first trip since the invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago. The visit signaled India's independent foreign policy and its continued engagement with Russia, a long-standing strategic partner. Despite pressure from the Trump administration to sever ties, India reaffirmed its relationship with Russia, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally welcoming Putin. The leaders discussed expanding economic ties, including a deal to allow more Indian nationals to work in Russia and continued Russian fuel shipments to India's growing economy. However, India's purchases of Russian oil have recently decreased due to punitive tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and EU sanctions. India is also increasing its purchases of U.S. oil and natural gas, navigating a complex geopolitical landscape. While Russia remains a key strategic partner for India, the long-term trajectory suggests a managed decline in the relationship. India emphasizes its readiness to contribute to peaceful resolutions in Ukraine, though the specifics of any peace efforts remain unclear. The trade between Russia and India is heavily dominated by India's fossil fuel imports from Russia, with a stated goal of reaching $100 billion.
