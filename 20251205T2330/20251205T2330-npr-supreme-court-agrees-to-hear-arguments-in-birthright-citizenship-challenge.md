## Article summary
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on a challenge to the principle of birthright citizenship, a legal understanding that has been in place for 127 years. The Trump administration argues that citizenship has been too easily granted to children of non-citizens. An executive order signed by President Trump on his first day in office aimed to deny citizenship to children born to non-citizens unlawfully present or temporarily in the U.S. This order would apply to births occurring 30 days after January 20, 2025. However, four federal courts and two appeals courts have blocked the order's implementation, citing the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction. The administration contends that individuals present temporarily are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction and criticizes "birth tourism." The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case suggests the importance of the issue to the President, who may be pursuing a "long game" strategy. The governing precedent for birthright citizenship is the 1898 Supreme Court case, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which affirmed the citizenship of a child born in San Francisco to Chinese citizens. By taking this case, the Supreme Court could potentially alter the understanding of birthright citizenship and highlight the issue before the 2026 mid-term elections.
