## Article summary
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's order on birthright citizenship. This order declared that children born to parents residing in the U.S. illegally or temporarily are not American citizens. The justices will review Trump's appeal after a lower court struck down the citizenship restrictions, which have not yet taken effect anywhere. This birthright citizenship order, signed on Trump's second term's first day, is part of a broader immigration crackdown. The administration is facing multiple court challenges, with the Supreme Court sending mixed signals in emergency orders. This case marks the first Trump immigration policy to reach the Supreme Court for a final ruling. The order challenges over 125 years of understanding that the Constitution's 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on U.S. soil. Lower courts have consistently struck down the executive order as unconstitutional. The case under review originates from New Hampshire, where a federal judge blocked the order in a class-action lawsuit. The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team challenging the order, asserting that no president can alter the 14th Amendment's promise of citizenship. The administration argues that children of noncitizens are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction and thus not entitled to citizenship.
