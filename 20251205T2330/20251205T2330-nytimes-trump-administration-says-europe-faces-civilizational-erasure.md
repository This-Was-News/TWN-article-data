## Article summary
The Trump administration has issued a stark warning that Europe is facing "civilizational erasure" due to current immigration policies. This assessment was part of the annual update to the United States national security strategy. The document suggests that the U.S. should support patriotic and nationalist parties in Europe that oppose migration. It criticizes European migration policies for undermining national identities and making the continent unrecognizable. The administration believes the U.S. should help Europe correct its trajectory over the coming decades. The strategy emphasizes an "America First" approach, aiming to maintain American global dominance. The document implicitly refers to right-wing populist parties, such as Reform UK and Germany's AfD, as potential allies in this endeavor. The goal is to prevent NATO members from becoming majority non-European. This policy reflects President Trump's expressed disdain for European political leadership.
