## Article summary
California Rep. Darrell Issa considered moving to Texas to run for Congress after redistricting efforts in both states created a scramble for midterm elections. Texas colleagues had encouraged him to consider the move, seeing it as a way to fill newly created seats. However, Issa ultimately decided to stay in California, citing his deep roots in the state and urging fellow California Republicans facing tough new districts to do the same. He believes redrawing districts in between censuses is unconstitutional. Several other California Republican representatives are facing difficult reelection prospects due to the new maps, with some opting to run against each other. President Donald Trump had initiated the nationwide redistricting battle by urging Republicans in Texas to redraw their congressional lines to gain seats, prompting a response from California Democrats. Issa's decision to remain in California ensures an incumbent will contest a battleground seat in San Diego County. The National Republican Congressional Committee had encouraged incumbents to stay in their seats to help hold the party's majority.
