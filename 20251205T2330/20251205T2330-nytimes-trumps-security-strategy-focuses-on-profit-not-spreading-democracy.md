## Article summary
The Trump administration's updated National Security Strategy prioritizes profit and American business interests over spreading democracy or imposing social change. This document, released late Thursday, narrows the focus of U.S. national interests, moving away from the portrayal of the United States as a global force for freedom. It emphasizes reducing migration and engaging with authoritarians as sources of revenue rather than promoting democratic values. The strategy suggests that Latin American countries must grant no-bid contracts to U.S. companies and that the U.S. will reassert the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere. It also calls for an end to U.S. pressure on wealthy Gulf monarchies to change their forms of government. Unlike previous strategies, this document does not characterize democracy as a value to be defended, viewing Israel and Taiwan primarily through the lens of their economic significance. The strategy also adopts a more restrained view of geopolitical competition, not describing Russia as an adversary and framing China mainly in commercial terms. It calls for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine to re-establish strategic stability with Russia and enable Ukraine's survival. While some analysts caution against overemphasizing its impact due to the President's mercurial nature, the document signifies a shift towards avoiding military entanglements and promoting commerce as core foreign policy aims.
