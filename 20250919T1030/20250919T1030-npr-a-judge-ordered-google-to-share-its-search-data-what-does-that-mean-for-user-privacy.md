## Article summary
A judge ordered Google to share its search index and user click-and-query data with competitors to reduce its monopoly power. This data includes sensitive information about users' searches and clicks, raising privacy concerns. Google has previously shared aggregate data but not detailed user information. The ruling requires Google to share this data with 'qualified competitors,' determined by a future technical oversight committee. Experts warn that sharing this data could expose private information to third parties, potentially identifying users and their search histories. Google has expressed concerns about privacy risks, and the committee will establish standards for data security. The data includes a snapshot of Google's search index and users' click-and-query data, which is highly valuable for improving search engines. Privacy experts emphasize the lack of user control over their data and the potential for misuse. The committee will also decide how to anonymize data to protect users while making it useful for competitors. Google is expected to appeal the ruling, potentially delaying the process. The committee's dual mandate to increase competition and protect privacy may lead to conflicts.
