## Article summary
A U.S. vaccine advisory committee recommended new restrictions on the MMRV vaccine, advising against its use before age 4 and suggesting separate vaccines for younger children. The panel also delayed a vote on hepatitis B shots for newborns, which they will reconsider on Friday. The committee, appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has faced criticism for promoting vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Doctors and public health experts warn that the committee's actions could reduce vaccine access and increase public mistrust. The MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox, has been linked to rare feverish seizures in young children. Despite this, experts argue that the benefits outweigh the risks. The committee's decisions have raised concerns about the lack of new safety data supporting the changes. Meanwhile, discussions on hepatitis B vaccines highlighted the effectiveness of infant vaccinations in preventing chronic infections. Some committee members questioned the necessity of immediate vaccination for all newborns, while others emphasized the vaccine's safety and importance. Overall, the panel's actions have sparked debate about vaccine policies and public health strategies.
