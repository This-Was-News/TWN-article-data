## Article summary
Prosecutors in Utah are preparing to argue that 22-year-old Tyler Robinson killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk due to disagreements with Kirk's anti-trans rhetoric. Text messages suggest Robinson had personal grievances and was influenced by online culture. High-profile conservatives have speculated about political motives, but evidence remains inconclusive. Researchers suggest Robinson's actions were driven by a single-issue grievance and a desire to perform violence for online attention. The bullet casings engraved with memes and in-jokes indicate a focus on being remembered rather than conveying a clear political message. The act of violence is seen as performative, aiming to generate discourse and fit into the narrative of mass shooters. Kirk's assassination has left his family devastated and sparked discussions about the intersection of online culture and real-world violence. Researchers warn that targeted political shootings may become a means for aspiring perpetrators to gain notoriety.
