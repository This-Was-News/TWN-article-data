## Article summary
The term 'consequence culture' is being used by some conservatives to rebrand what was previously known as 'cancel culture' following the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk. This shift comes as numerous individuals, including Jimmy Kimmel, face job losses for remarks deemed insensitive about Kirk. The White House and Vice President JD Vance have encouraged reporting those celebrating Kirk's death, leading to accusations of hypocrisy from the right. Conservatives argue that consequence culture is about facing repercussions for offensive actions, not censorship. The term has gained traction in conservative media, though it has been used since the late 2010s. Initially, conservatives opposed cancel culture but now embrace the concept under a new name. Critics argue that consequence culture enforced by government entities, like the FCC, is an authoritarian crackdown rather than a cultural shift. The debate highlights the evolving language and tactics in political and social discourse.
