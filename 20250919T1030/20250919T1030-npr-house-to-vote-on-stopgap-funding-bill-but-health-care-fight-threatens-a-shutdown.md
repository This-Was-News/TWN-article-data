## Article summary
The House is set to vote on a stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown, with Republicans aiming to fund federal agencies through November 21 and increase security for officials. However, Democrats oppose the bill, citing its impact on health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. House Speaker Mike Johnson expects the bill to pass, despite some Republican dissent. Former President Trump has endorsed the bill, urging Republicans to support it. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have introduced their own bill, extending funding through October 31 and reversing Medicaid changes. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has stated that Democrats will not support the Republican bill, citing its impact on health care. The fight over health care has split congressional Republicans, with some acknowledging the popularity of the Affordable Care Act. Senate leaders are prepared to allow votes on both the GOP and Democratic bills. Speaker Johnson has not ruled out addressing the ACA subsidies but believes it should be discussed in December.
