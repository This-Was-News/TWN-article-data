## Article summary
More than a dozen elected officials were arrested while protesting conditions at a New York City immigration holding facility. The officials, including city and state lawmakers, were among 77 people detained during protests at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. They attempted to inspect holding rooms on the 10th floor, which are the subject of ongoing litigation alleging squalid conditions and overcrowding. Federal agents arrested them during a sit-in in the hallway. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticized the officials, particularly city comptroller Brad Lander, for their actions. State Sen. Jabari Brisport described the conditions as disgusting and cowardly. Outside, police arrested dozens more, including politicians and advocates. A federal judge had issued an injunction requiring ICE to improve conditions, including limiting capacity and ensuring cleanliness. Detainees had previously complained about inedible food and unsanitary conditions. The protests followed a lawsuit filed by immigration and civil rights organizations.
