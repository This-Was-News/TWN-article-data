## Article summary
Russia and Vietnam have developed a covert method to circumvent U.S. and Western sanctions by using profits from joint oil and gas ventures to pay for Russian military equipment. This system allows Vietnam to purchase arms on credit and repay using profits from the Rusvietpetro joint venture in Siberia, avoiding direct cash transfers through the global banking system. The arrangement was finalized despite initial leaks and concerns about U.S. sanctions, as outlined in internal Vietnamese documents obtained by The Associated Press. The U.S. State Department has not commented specifically on the documents but reiterated that sanctions remain in place. The mechanism involves transferring profits to Russian state-owned oil company Zarubezhneft, which then uses a joint venture in Vietnam to complete the payment, effectively keeping transactions within Russia and Vietnam to avoid international scrutiny. This strategy is seen as a way to insulate both countries from potential future sanctions. The revelation comes at a time when the U.S. is strengthening ties with Vietnam as a counterbalance to China's growing influence in Southeast Asia, while also imposing tariffs and threatening further sanctions on Russia. Vietnam's military purchases from Russia include fighter jets, tanks, and ships, with recent deals involving significant credit extensions. The arrangement highlights Vietnam's delicate balancing act between maintaining military ties with Russia and fostering a growing relationship with the U.S.
