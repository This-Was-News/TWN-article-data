## Article summary
A federal vaccine advisory panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), voted 8-3 to change childhood vaccine recommendations, reducing the option for children under 4 to receive the MMRV vaccine, which covers measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. The vote, which requires final approval from the CDC director, was met with opposition from medical groups. The panel also debated changes to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule, with some members questioning the necessity of universal vaccination at birth. CDC scientists presented data showing potential risks and benefits, including a slightly increased risk of fever-related seizures from the MMRV shot. The changes reflect Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign to reshape vaccine policy, sparking controversy and tension with the medical establishment. The meeting occurred amid a broader debate over vaccine policymaking, with the American Academy of Pediatrics boycotting the process, citing a lack of credibility. The ACIP chair, Martin Kulldorff, defended the panel against criticism, challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. The proposed changes could impact insurance coverage and vaccination rates, raising concerns about public health outcomes.
