## Article summary
Authorities in Washington state believe they have found the remains of Travis Decker, an ex-soldier wanted for the deaths of his three daughters. The Chelan County Sheriff's Office is processing the site with the help of the Washington State Patrol crime scene response team, and DNA analysis will follow. Decker, 32, has been wanted since June 2, when his truck and the bodies of his daughters—9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn, and 5-year-old Olivia—were found at a campground. He failed to return the girls to their mother's home in Wenatchee after a scheduled visit. Decker served in the Army and had training in navigation and survival skills, having once lived off the grid for over two months. A massive search involving state and federal agencies was conducted, with a $20,000 reward offered for his capture. His ex-wife had previously reported his worsening mental health and instability, leading her to seek restrictions on his visits with the girls. An autopsy revealed the girls died of suffocation, bound with zip ties and plastic bags over their heads.
