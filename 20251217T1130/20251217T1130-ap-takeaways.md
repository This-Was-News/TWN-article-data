## Article summary
White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has offered a candid perspective on the Trump administration, detailing her views on President Trump, his inner circle, and key policy decisions in interviews with Vanity Fair. Despite the White House's efforts to label the article a "hit piece," Wiles has not denied the attributed quotes. She described Trump as having an "alcoholic's personality" and acknowledged his penchant for retribution, though she believes his motives have shifted from personal score-settling to preventing others from facing similar hardships. Wiles criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and stated Trump was incorrect about former President Bill Clinton's alleged visits to Epstein's island. She also shared insights on figures like Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., noting Vance's "MAGA conversion" as political and Musk's approach to government efficiency as "odd." Wiles admitted the administration's tariff strategy has been "more painful than I expected" and conceded mistakes were made in immigration policies, particularly concerning the deportation of mothers and children. Regarding foreign policy, she expressed skepticism about Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, believing he desires more than just the Donbas region of Ukraine. Wiles also indicated that Trump's strategy of targeting vessels in the Caribbean is aimed at ousting Nicolás Maduro from power in Venezuela.
