## Article summary
The suspected gunman in the Bondi Beach massacre, Naveed Akram, has been charged with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder, following an antisemitic attack that killed 15 people and injured over 20. The victims, all identified as Jewish, ranged in age from 10 to 87. Funerals for the victims have begun, with the first being Rabbi Eli Schlanger, a community leader and father of five. Authorities believe the attack was inspired by the Islamic State group, and investigations are underway into the suspects' backgrounds and a recent trip to the Philippines. The incident has prompted discussions about gun control and antisemitism in Australia. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to tighten gun laws and combat antisemitism, with proposed measures including restricting gun ownership to citizens. In the wake of the tragedy, Australians have come together to grieve, with blood donations and vigils held. Despite the attack, the community plans to continue the annual Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach to defy the attackers' intent.
