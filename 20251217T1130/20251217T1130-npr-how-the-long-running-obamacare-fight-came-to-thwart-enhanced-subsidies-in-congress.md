## Article summary
Enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans are set to expire at the end of the year, potentially doubling or tripling premiums for millions of Americans. Despite broad public support for extending these subsidies, Congress is heading for a holiday recess without a solution. Bipartisan efforts to pass legislation have stalled, with dueling partisan measures failing to gain traction. House Speaker Mike Johnson's proposed health reform package, set for a vote, does not include an extension of the subsidies. Democrats are pushing for a standalone extension, while some Republicans favor reforms like association health plans or health savings accounts. Some Republicans, including those in conservative districts, are calling for the subsidies to be maintained due to constituent concerns about affordability. The debate over the ACA, which has evolved significantly since its passage, continues to be a major political issue, with potential implications for upcoming elections. Lawmakers acknowledge the ACA's deep integration into the healthcare system, making outright repeal unlikely. As the deadline approaches, the urgency to address the expiring subsidies grows, though a resolution remains uncertain.
