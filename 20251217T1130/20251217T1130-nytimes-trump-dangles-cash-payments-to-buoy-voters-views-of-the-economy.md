## Article summary
President Trump is considering offering cash payments to Americans to address concerns about the economy and rising prices. This strategy mirrors his past approach during the COVID-19 pandemic, where stimulus checks proved politically popular. He has teased the possibility of one-time $2,000 rebate checks funded by tariffs, though a detailed plan and congressional approval are lacking. Additionally, the White House is highlighting anticipated larger tax refunds in 2026, resulting from recent tax cuts. Economists express skepticism, arguing that such payments may not solve underlying affordability issues and could potentially worsen inflation. While the administration claims these measures will bolster the economy and ease financial burdens, experts caution against simply injecting money without addressing root causes. The proposed tariff rebates could be significantly more expensive than the revenue generated from tariffs. Meanwhile, upcoming tax refunds, particularly those related to new tax breaks for tips and overtime, are expected to provide a boost to some households, though the most substantial benefits may go to wealthier individuals. The political impact of these lump-sum payments is seen as potentially significant for improving public perception of the economy.
