## Article summary
Heating costs in the U.S. are projected to rise by 9.2% this winter, with the average household expected to spend nearly $1,000. This increase is attributed to higher electricity and natural gas prices, coupled with forecasts for colder weather. For many families already struggling financially, these rising costs are devastating, pushing millions deeper into utility debt and closer to service shut-offs. Home energy costs have been steadily climbing due to increased spending by utility companies on electric grids for wildfire mitigation, extreme weather resilience, and deferred maintenance. Additionally, billions are being invested in grid upgrades to meet the anticipated surge in electricity demand from data centers supporting artificial intelligence services. The cost of energy has become a significant consumer concern, impacting recent elections. Residential electricity prices have outpaced overall inflation, with the average cost per kilowatt-hour rising nearly 30% since 2021. Those relying on electric heaters face an average increase of 12.2%, while natural gas users can expect an 8.4% rise. Compounding these issues, federal funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has been cut by about a third compared to two years ago, leaving millions of eligible households without sufficient aid. Consequently, energy experts warn that some individuals may resort to unsafe indoor temperatures or go without heat. The number of utility service shut-offs is also on the rise, with an expected four million accounts to be disconnected in 2024. Political rhetoric surrounds the issue, with differing views on the causes and solutions, including debates over energy policies and their impact on affordability.
