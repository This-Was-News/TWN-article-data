## Article summary
Donald Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency has significantly impacted the digital currency landscape, transforming it into a major economic force. He declared himself the "first crypto president," ending regulatory crackdowns, promoting crypto investments, signing pro-crypto legislation, and even launching a memecoin. This advocacy has spurred a frenzy of crypto activity, leading to the emergence of numerous new ventures. Over 250 publicly traded companies are now accumulating cryptocurrencies as investments. Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street financier, became an adviser to three companies with strategies centered on accumulating crypto to attract investors. However, the crypto market experienced a significant downturn in the fall, causing the shares of these ventures, including those Scaramucci advised, to plummet dramatically, with one falling over 80 percent. The consequences of Trump's pro-crypto stance are now becoming apparent as more people are exposed to the volatile nature of virtual currencies.
