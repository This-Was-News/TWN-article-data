## Article summary
President Donald Trump has ordered a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela, escalating pressure on the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro. This action follows a recent seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker by U.S. forces. Trump stated on social media that Venezuela uses oil to fund drug trafficking and other crimes, demanding the return of oil, land, and assets he claims were stolen from the U.S. Venezuela's government condemned the blockade as a violation of international law and a threat to free navigation, vowing to denounce the situation at the United Nations. The U.S. military buildup in the region includes several ships and aircraft capable of monitoring maritime traffic. The Trump administration has defended its actions, including military strikes on vessels, as necessary to stop drug trafficking, though critics question the legality of these operations. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles suggested the campaign aims to force Maduro's resignation. Venezuela, possessing the world's largest oil reserves, has relied on oil revenue, with its state-owned oil company, PDVSA, circumventing U.S. sanctions by selling exports on the black market, primarily to China. The U.S. has previously imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector and designated some Venezuelan military officers involved in drug trafficking as a foreign terrorist organization.
