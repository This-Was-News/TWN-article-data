## Article summary
A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll reveals that President Trump's approval rating for his handling of the economy has hit a new low of 36%, marking his worst performance on this issue in six years. The poll indicates that 70% of Americans find things too unaffordable, and a majority believe the country is already in a recession, with significant divides based on race, age, and gender. Prices are the primary economic concern for most respondents, overshadowing issues like housing and job security. Despite the economic challenges, Trump retains strong support from Republicans, with 84% approving of his job performance. However, his overall job approval rating stands at a low 38%, the lowest of his second term. The survey also highlights that many Americans are struggling to make ends meet, with a significant portion reporting that their expenses exceed their income. Concerns about healthcare costs are also prevalent, particularly among minority groups, lower-income individuals, and younger people. The poll suggests a general pessimism about the future, with nearly 6 in 10 Americans feeling more pessimistic about the year ahead. These findings indicate that President Trump faces a significant challenge in convincing Americans that his administration can improve the economic situation.
