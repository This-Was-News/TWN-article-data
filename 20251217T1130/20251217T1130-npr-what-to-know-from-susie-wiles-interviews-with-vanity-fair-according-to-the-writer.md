## Article summary
Chris Whipple, a writer for _Vanity Fair_, has published a profile based on 11 in-depth interviews with White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Whipple describes Wiles as someone who rarely speaks but is direct and unhesitant when she does. The profile reveals Wiles' critical assessments of several colleagues, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom she felt mishandled the Epstein files, and Vice President J.D. Vance, labeled a "conspiracy theorist." Wiles also offered a candid description of President Donald Trump, characterizing his personality as akin to that of an "alcoholic," a sentiment Trump himself later echoed. Despite Wiles' assertion that the profile was a "disingenuously framed hit piece" and presented a "chaotic and negative narrative," Whipple noted that none of the factual claims within the reporting were contested. This access and Wiles' candidness are described by Whipple as a rare occurrence in his career.
