## Article summary
The accused gunman in the Bondi Beach massacre, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, has been charged with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder. The attack, which targeted Jews celebrating Hanukkah, resulted in 15 deaths and over 20 injuries. Authorities are investigating the incident as a terrorist act inspired by the Islamic State group, and are also examining a trip the suspects made to the Philippines. The victims ranged in age from a 10-year-old girl to an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor. Funerals for the victims have begun, with hundreds of mourners gathering in Sydney to pay their respects. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has vowed to take action against antisemitism and has pledged to tighten Australia's gun laws, potentially restricting ownership to citizens and limiting the number of weapons an individual can possess. In the wake of the tragedy, Australians have come together to grieve, with blood donation sites seeing long lines and a commemorative swim held at Bondi Beach. The community is determined to continue traditions like the Hanukkah celebration, defying the attackers' intent to instill fear.
