## Article summary
Police in Providence have released information indicating that the suspect in a mass shooting at Brown University appeared to be casing the area for hours before the incident. Surveillance footage shows a person of interest arriving around 10:30 a.m. and remaining until the shooting began at approximately 4:05 p.m. The suspect, described as heavyset and wearing a winter hat and surgical mask, has not been identified. Investigators are urging the public to provide any additional security footage from the neighborhood to aid in identification, focusing on the suspect's movement patterns. The FBI has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. The shooting resulted in the deaths of two students, identified as sophomore Ella Cook and freshman Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, and injured nine others. While most of the injured are in stable condition, the motive behind the attack remains unclear, with no evidence currently suggesting an ethnicity or politically related cause. Authorities are continuing to gather and review evidence as the investigation progresses.
