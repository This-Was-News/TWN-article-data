## Article summary
NPR's weekly quiz continues, even as government shutdowns end and political matters become subdued. This week's quiz features a mix of topics, including trivia about President James Garfield (both the president and a cat), killer rodents, and bro culture. The quiz touches upon subjects like the northern lights, John Fetterman, the Louvre, rats, bats, Representative Adelita Grijalva, podcasting, mortgages, and pennies. Despite a light mention of politics, the quiz promises a diverse range of questions for participants to test their knowledge.
