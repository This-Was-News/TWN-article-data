## Article summary
President Trump has directed the Justice Department to investigate Democrats' dealings with Jeffrey Epstein, following revelations of his own past association with the convicted sex offender. This directive came after a trove of Epstein's emails, mentioning Trump, were made public. Attorney General Pam Bondi quickly agreed to Trump's demand, despite the Justice Department previously stating no further investigation was warranted. This action is seen as a significant erosion of the Justice Department's independence. Trump publicly accused Democrats of using Epstein for political gain, a tactic he has employed during past crises. The demand for an investigation was prompted by emails released by House Democrats suggesting Trump had deeper knowledge of Epstein's sex-trafficking operation than previously admitted. Trump denies any involvement or knowledge of Epstein's crimes. The investigation's assignment to U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton could potentially allow the Justice Department to withhold further Epstein files. Democrats accuse Trump of attempting to deflect from scrutiny of his own relationship with Epstein, while some Republicans criticize him for undermining the Justice Department's credibility.
