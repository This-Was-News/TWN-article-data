## Article summary
Federal immigration agents are reportedly planning an enforcement operation in Charlotte, North Carolina, the state's largest city. While the federal government has not publicly announced this move, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden was informed of the potential operation, which could begin soon after the upcoming weekend. This action is seen as an extension of a strategy employed by the Trump administration to deploy immigration agents or the military in major cities, a tactic that has raised concerns and led to legal challenges. Charlotte, a diverse city with a significant foreign-born population, has seen a decrease in crime. However, the administration has cited the fatal stabbing of a refugee in the city as evidence of perceived failures in Democratic-led cities. Local authorities, including the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, have stated they have no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and are not involved in these operations. Community groups are organizing to monitor sweeps, inform immigrants of their rights, and support residents. There is no indication that the National Guard will be involved in Charlotte, despite requests from some congressional members. The governor's office suggested local police are better suited to ensure neighborhood safety.
