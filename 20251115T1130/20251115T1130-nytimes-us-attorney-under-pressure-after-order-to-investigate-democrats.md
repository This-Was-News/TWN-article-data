## Article summary
Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, is now under pressure following President Trump's order to investigate ties between Jeffrey Epstein and prominent Democrats. Initially, Clayton had a quiet tenure, avoiding politically charged directives. However, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him to lead this explicit political assignment, citing his capability and trustworthiness. Clayton, a corporate lawyer with no prior prosecutorial experience before leading the Manhattan office, must now navigate this directive. His response will significantly impact the independence of his office, which was once defined by its separation from Washington. Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a former Manhattan district attorney, described Clayton as a smart, independent lawyer unlikely to compromise his principles for the president. The coming months will test this assertion, especially as Clayton's office has not yet brought high-profile cases or shown public progress on another politically charged assignment involving a group funded by George Soros.
