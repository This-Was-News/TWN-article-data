## Article summary
The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days, has ended. The shutdown began due to a disagreement over funding, with Democrats, led by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, prioritizing the extension of health care subsidies. Initially, Democrats presented a united front, refusing to pass a spending package without these subsidies. However, the shutdown concluded without the inclusion of the health care extensions Democrats sought. A deal was struck when eight moderate senators crossed the aisle, agreeing with Senate Republicans to reopen the government, citing the suffering of the public and the unlikelihood of negotiation with President Trump and congressional Republicans. The new spending package funds the government until January 30, with specific carveouts for programs like SNAP, WIC, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Congress itself funded until September 2026. The bill also addresses back pay for federal workers and includes increased security funding for government officials. A potential for another shutdown looms after January 30, depending on lessons learned by Democrats and potential future votes on health care subsidies. While Democrats did not secure immediate health care subsidy extensions, they elevated the issue, potentially holding Republicans accountable for future increases in healthcare costs. Federal workers are returning to work, and airport operations are expected to normalize gradually. The shutdown also saw unexpected developments, including a controversial provision allowing senators to sue the Justice Department and a heated disagreement between Republican senators over hemp regulation. The release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein was also indirectly impacted, with a new Democratic representative's support potentially aiding efforts to compel their release. Politically, Democrats are seen as gaining an advantage, particularly in upcoming midterm elections, by highlighting affordability and healthcare issues.
