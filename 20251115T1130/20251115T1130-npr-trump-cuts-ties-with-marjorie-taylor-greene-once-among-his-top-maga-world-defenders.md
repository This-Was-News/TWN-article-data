## Article summary
Donald Trump has publicly severed ties with Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a once prominent supporter within his MAGA movement. Trump referred to Greene as "Wacky" Marjorie and stated he would endorse a challenger against her in the upcoming midterm elections. This public break follows months of simmering disputes, with Greene increasingly diverging from Republican leadership, particularly during a recent federal government shutdown. Trump accused Greene of "going Far Left" and engaging in constant complaints, dismissing her calls as those of a "ranting Lunatic." Greene responded by accusing Trump of attacking and lying about her, suggesting his anger stemmed from her push to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. She asserted that she does not "worship or serve Donald Trump," despite her past strong support. The rift appears to be a consequence of recent off-cycle election results where Democrats saw gains. Greene has also voiced concerns that Trump's focus on foreign affairs detracts from domestic issues like high prices. Trump believes Greene has "lost her way" and a "wonderful conservative reputation." Greene's discontent has been building since May, marked by her decision not to run for Senate and her public support for Tucker Carlson. In recent weeks, she has made media appearances, including on "The View," where some observers noted a shift in her demeanor, leading to speculation about her political future and a potential moderation of her profile.
