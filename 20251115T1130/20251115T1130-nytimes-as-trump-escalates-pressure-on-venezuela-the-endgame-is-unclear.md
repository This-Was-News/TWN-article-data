## Article summary
The Trump administration is intensifying its efforts against Venezuela, with the USS Ford aircraft carrier positioned to strike the country. President Trump has held meetings to discuss military options, including Special Operations and direct action, but his ultimate decision remains unclear. Trump stated he had made up his mind but did not disclose it, mentioning progress in stopping drug flow. The administration's new posture, dubbed 'Southern Spear' by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, aims to remove 'narco-terrorists' from the Western Hemisphere. The deployment of the Ford and accompanying destroyers brings 15,000 troops to the region, the largest presence in decades. Nicolás Maduro's forces are on high alert, increasing tensions between the two nations.
