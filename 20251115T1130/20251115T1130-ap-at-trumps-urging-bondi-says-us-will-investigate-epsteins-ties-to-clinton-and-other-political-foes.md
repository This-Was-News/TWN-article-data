## Article summary
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered a federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's ties to political figures, including former President Bill Clinton, at the urging of President Donald Trump. Trump, who has a past friendship with Epstein, demanded the probe into Epstein's connections with Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, labeling it an "Epstein Hoax" involving Democrats. This action is seen as an erosion of the Justice Department's independence and an attempt at deflection, given Trump's own past scrutiny over his closeness to Epstein. JPMorgan Chase, which provided banking services to Epstein, expressed regret for its association but stated it did not facilitate his crimes. Clinton, through a spokesperson, denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, despite having traveled on his private jet. The FBI's previous memo indicated no evidence was found to predicate investigations against uncharged third parties. The release of nearly 23,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate has fueled the ongoing political debate, with Democrats releasing emails mentioning Trump and Republicans disclosing broader correspondence. Trump maintains his authority as the chief law enforcement officer to request such investigations, while Democrats are pushing for the release of all Epstein-related government files and communications, viewing the calls for investigations as political persecution.
