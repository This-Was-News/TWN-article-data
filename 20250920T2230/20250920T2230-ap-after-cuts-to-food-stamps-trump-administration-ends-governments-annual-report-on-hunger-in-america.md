## Article summary
The Trump administration has decided to end the annual Household Food Security Report on hunger in America, citing politicization and inaccuracies. This decision follows recent legislation that reduced food aid, potentially affecting 3 million people's access to SNAP benefits. The USDA claims the report's data is subjective and not representative of current economic conditions, which include lower poverty rates and job growth. Critics argue the administration is suppressing data that could show increased hunger due to its policies. The final report is scheduled for release on October 22, 2024. The Census Bureau reported a slight decrease in the poverty rate before Trump's tenure. The administration's move has drawn comparisons to non-democratic practices of manipulating or canceling unfavorable reports.
