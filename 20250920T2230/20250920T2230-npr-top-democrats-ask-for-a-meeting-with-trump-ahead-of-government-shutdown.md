## Article summary
Top congressional Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have requested a meeting with President Trump ahead of an impending government shutdown. In a letter, they criticized GOP leaders for refusing bipartisan negotiations to keep the government open. The House approved a short-term spending bill, but it failed in the Senate, along with a Democratic alternative. With a deadline of Sept. 30 to fund the government, both parties are blaming each other for potential shutdown consequences. Schumer and Jeffries argue that Republicans will bear responsibility, while House Speaker Mike Johnson claims Democrats will own the consequences if they oppose the spending bill.
