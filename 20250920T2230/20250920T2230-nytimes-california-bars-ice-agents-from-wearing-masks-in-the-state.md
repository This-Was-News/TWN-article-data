## Article summary
California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill to prevent federal immigration agents from wearing masks in the state, a response to President Trump's deportation crackdown. The law, which also applies to local law enforcement, is expected to face legal challenges as it is unclear if California can enforce such restrictions on federal agents. Videos of masked agents handcuffing immigrants in Southern California have sparked protests and criticism, with Democratic leaders and activists arguing that the masks allow agents to act with impunity. The law bars officers from wearing face coverings that shield their identities, though it does not apply to medical masks or safety devices. Law enforcement agencies oppose the law, arguing that masks protect officers and their families from retaliation. Similar bills have been proposed in other Democratic-led states, but California is the first to pass such legislation. Legal experts agree that while the state can require local officers to unmask, regulating federal agents is more complex. The law is likely to be challenged in court, with the federal government potentially seeking an injunction. Newsom also signed four other bills aimed at restricting ICE activity in California, including preventing agents from entering schools and hospitals without a warrant. The bills aim to protect undocumented immigrants from enforcement actions that could deter them from seeking essential services.
