## Article summary
Mary Maggie Cleary, a conservative lawyer, has been appointed as the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, replacing Erik Siebert who resigned amidst political pressure. Cleary's appointment comes as the office faces turmoil over efforts by Trump administration officials to pursue criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. The investigation, which has not yet resulted in charges, focuses on alleged paperwork discrepancies in James' properties. Cleary, who has previously worked as a prosecutor and in Virginia's Republican administration, has spoken out about being falsely accused of being at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. She described the experience as political targeting and expressed her desire to address such issues in her new role. The Justice Department's investigation into James has been ongoing for months without any indication of incriminating evidence. Cleary's appointment is seen as unexpected but she has expressed humility in taking on the role. President Trump claimed he fired Siebert, contradicting Siebert's resignation statement. Cleary's background includes working in the criminal division of the Justice Department and serving in Virginia's Attorney General office.
