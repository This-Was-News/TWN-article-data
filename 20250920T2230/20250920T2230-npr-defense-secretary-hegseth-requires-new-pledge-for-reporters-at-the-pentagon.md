## Article summary
The Pentagon is implementing new rules for journalists, requiring them to sign a pledge not to gather unauthorized information, including unclassified reports. The policy, outlined in a 17-page document, threatens to revoke press credentials for non-compliance, effectively cutting off access to the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the changes on social media, stating that the press does not run the Pentagon. The new rules align with the broader Trump administration's efforts to limit coverage from outlets deemed unfair. Media organizations and free press advocates have sharply criticized the move, arguing it undermines independent journalism and transparency. The National Press Club and the Pentagon Press Association have expressed concerns about the policy's impact on reporting vital information about the U.S. military. NPR and other news organizations are planning to push back against the restrictions, emphasizing the importance of the First Amendment and transparency. The changes also follow earlier restrictions on reporters' movement within the Pentagon, breaking long-standing traditions. The new policy has drawn widespread criticism for potentially limiting the public's access to crucial information about military operations and defense spending.
