## Article summary
California has become the first state to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces while conducting official business. This ban was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom in response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, where federal agents wore masks during mass arrests, sparking protests. Newsom emphasized California's diversity and the need to protect immigrants' rights, stating that the state is pushing back against the practice of masked agents detaining people without identification. However, the enforcement of this ban on federal agents is uncertain, as Trump administration officials argue that obscuring identities is necessary for agents' safety. The new law prohibits facial coverings for local and federal officers, with exceptions for undercover agents, medical masks, and tactical gear. Similar proposals have been introduced in several other states. Additionally, Newsom signed legislation preventing immigration agents from entering schools and health care facilities without a valid warrant, aiming to protect students from fear of deportation. The California Safe Haven Schools Act sends a clear message to the Trump administration to keep ICE out of schools. Earlier this year, California also authorized $50 million for legal groups to sue the Trump administration, resulting in over 40 lawsuits.
