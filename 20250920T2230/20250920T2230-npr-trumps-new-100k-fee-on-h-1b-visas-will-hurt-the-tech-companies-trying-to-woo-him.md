## Article summary
President Trump has signed an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, impacting tech companies that heavily rely on this program for hiring high-skilled foreign workers. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase have warned their employees to stay in the U.S. or return before the deadline. The fee does not apply to renewals or current visa holders. Over half a million U.S. residents are on H-1B visas, with 85,000 issued annually through a lottery. The program is intended for highly educated workers, and companies must attest that they cannot find American workers with similar skills. Critics argue that the program has been abused to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign labor. Some economists and politicians have long criticized the H-1B program for exploiting workers. While some praise Trump's move, immigration-focused groups argue it shrinks the talent pipeline and undermines job creation. The new fee is a setback for tech companies that have tried to curry favor with Trump, highlighting the challenges they face in dealing with his administration.
