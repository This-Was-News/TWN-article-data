## Article summary
The Fortunato's Green Idea House in Hermosa Beach, California, is a remodelled 1959 home that generates more energy than it consumes, achieving net-zero energy and zero carbon emissions. Robert Fortunato transformed his family's house using standard construction materials and off-the-shelf technologies, making it affordable compared to traditional remodels. The house features 26 solar panels that provide all the electricity needed for the home and two electric cars, eliminating utility bills for over a decade. The design includes a flat roof with a five-foot overhang that shields the sun, reducing heating and cooling energy use by 60%. The house also employs heat pump water heaters and efficient LED lighting to minimize energy consumption. Fortunato's project required extensive research, planning, and persistence, including overcoming contractor skepticism about new technologies like heat pump water heaters. The home's design prioritizes natural light and passive cooling strategies, such as an open stairway acting as a thermal chimney. Despite initial challenges, the Green Idea House serves as a model for sustainable living, inspiring others to adopt similar eco-friendly practices. Fortunato hopes his experience will encourage more people to build energy-efficient homes that are both stylish and functional.
