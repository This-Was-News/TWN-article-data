## Article summary
Israeli strikes in Gaza City have killed at least 14 people, prompting Palestinians to flee amid escalating conflict. Thousands in Israel protested, demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiate an end to the war. Meanwhile, several Western countries, including the U.K., France, and Canada, are preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly. Portugal announced it will recognize a Palestinian state on Sunday. The Israeli military's offensive, aimed at dismantling Hamas, has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and caused a severe humanitarian crisis, with famine reported in Gaza City. Aid groups warn that forced evacuations will worsen the crisis and are calling for a ceasefire. Families of hostages held by Hamas accuse Netanyahu of using the conflict to retain power. Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than half believed to be alive. Additionally, lifesaving food meant for malnourished children in Gaza was stolen from UNICEF trucks, with Israel blaming Hamas for the theft. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 65,100 since the conflict began.
