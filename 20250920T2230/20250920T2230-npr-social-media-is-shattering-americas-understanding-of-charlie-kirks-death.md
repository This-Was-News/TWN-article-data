## Article summary
The assassination of Charlie Kirk, CEO of Turning Point USA, has sparked a divisive national debate, with Vice President Vance blaming left-wing extremism and Jimmy Kimmel suggesting the shooter was part of the 'MAGA gang.' Social media has amplified this schism, with over half of U.S. adults getting news from these platforms, which fragment understanding of events. The rapid dissemination of graphic images of Kirk's death, shared by various outlets and individuals, provided a consistent forensic account but lacked context on the shooter's motives. Influencers quickly spread differing narratives, some linking the shooter to far-right groups, others to leftist militarization, or nihilistic video game culture. The arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who grew up in a conservative household but leaned left, particularly supporting gay and trans rights, has not resolved the debate. Charging documents reveal Robinson acted alone, motivated by Kirk's online attacks on the trans community, and his cryptic bullet messages were meant as an online meme. Despite this, social media continues to fuel conspiracy theories and calls to label left-wing activists as terrorists, highlighting how platforms prioritize engagement over nuance, reinforcing people's preexisting beliefs.
