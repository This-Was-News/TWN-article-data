## Article summary
The Supreme Court's "major questions doctrine," a principle requiring clear congressional authorization for sweeping executive actions, has been used to block several Biden administration initiatives. This doctrine will be tested again as the court considers former President Trump's tariffs program. The law underlying Trump's tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, lacks explicit mention of tariffs or similar terms, and the economic impact of these tariffs is substantial, potentially trillions of dollars. Critics argue the doctrine is applied inconsistently, appearing when ordinary legal principles fail to thwart disfavored programs. However, a potential distinction for national security and foreign policy contexts, suggested by Justice Kavanaugh, could favor Trump in this case. This distinction argues that the major questions canon has not typically been applied in foreign affairs, where presidents are usually granted broad authority. A recent Federal Circuit Court decision, however, applied the doctrine against Trump's tariffs, stating the executive's use of tariffs is of vast economic and political significance requiring clear congressional authorization. A dissenting judge in that case, and legal experts, argued the doctrine should not apply to foreign affairs, though they acknowledge the court may feel pressure to apply it given its previous rulings against Biden's agenda.
