## Article summary
Argentinas libertarian President Javier Milei secured significant victories in midterm elections, garnering over 40% of the vote and strengthening his mandate for free-market reforms. His party, La Libertad Avanza, won crucial seats in Congress, bolstering his ability to enact spending cuts and pursue tax and labor reforms. These results were closely watched by Washington, with former President Donald Trump having previously conditioned financial aid on Mileis success. Milei declared the election a turning point, aiming to reverse what he called "100 years of decadence" in Argentina. Despite these gains, Mileis austerity measures have polarized the electorate, with some benefiting from deregulation while others struggle with rising costs. The opposition, Peronism, suffered a significant defeat, highlighting its weakening influence. While the election provides Milei with momentum, he still needs to build coalitions to pass his legislative agenda. The victory is seen as a relief by foreign investors, but challenges remain in balancing economic reforms with public welfare. Turnout for the election was notably low, reflecting a sense of resignation among some voters.
