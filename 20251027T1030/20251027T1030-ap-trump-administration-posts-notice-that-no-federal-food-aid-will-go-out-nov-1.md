## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced that federal food aid, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), will not be issued on November 1st due to the ongoing government shutdown. This decision impacts approximately one in eight Americans who rely on SNAP for groceries. The Trump administration stated that contingency funds, intended for disaster relief, are not legally available to cover regular SNAP benefits. The shutdown, which began October 1st, is now the second-longest on record, and the cutoff of food aid would significantly broaden its impact. The administration blames Senate Democrats for the impasse, while Democrats insist on negotiating Affordable Care Act subsidies before reopening the government. Some states have expressed concern and considered ways to continue benefits, but face uncertainty regarding federal directives and reimbursement. Other states are advising SNAP recipients to prepare for the halt in payments and seek assistance from food banks. Senator Chris Murphy criticized Republicans and President Trump for refusing to negotiate, suggesting a resolution could be reached quickly if discussions began.
