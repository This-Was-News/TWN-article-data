## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa has intensified to a Category 5 storm as it approaches Jamaica, bringing the threat of up to 30 inches of rain and a life-threatening storm surge. The hurricane is expected to make landfall on the island Tuesday, with forecasts indicating it will cross Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday. Melissa, with sustained winds of 160 mph, is the strongest hurricane in recent history poised to directly impact Jamaica. Eastern Jamaica could experience up to 40 inches of rain, while western Haiti may receive 16 inches, raising concerns about catastrophic flash flooding and landslides. The storm has already caused deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, damaging homes and displacing thousands. Officials in Jamaica are urging residents to take the threat seriously, emphasizing the potential for severe disruption and delayed recovery efforts due to widespread flooding and landslides. Hurricane warnings are in effect for several Cuban provinces, with significant rainfall and storm surge anticipated. The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization warns that the flooding could jeopardize harvests and the winter agricultural season in Haiti, exacerbating an existing hunger crisis.
