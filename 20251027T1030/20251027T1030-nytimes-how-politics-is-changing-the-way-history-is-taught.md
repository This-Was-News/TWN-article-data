## Article summary
In the current political climate, history and civics education are undergoing significant changes, with a notable shift away from curricula perceived as too progressive. Major curriculum publishers are withdrawing products, and teachers are increasingly hesitant to cover once-uncontroversial topics like executive power limits. California, a large Democratic-led state, has enacted a law restricting classroom speech and has scaled back a proposed ethnic studies requirement for high school students. Supporters view these changes as a necessary correction to a perceived leftward educational tilt, while free speech advocates express alarm over the Trump administration's influence on patriotic historical narratives in schools. Historians note that while curriculum restrictions have occurred before, the current fervor from the right, coupled with the executive branch's involvement, is unprecedented. A significant increase in teachers modifying their curricula due to political pressure has been observed. Conservative activist Christopher Rufo attributes these shifts to a broader cultural change and the political liability of elite ideologies diverging from America's center-right culture. Institutions like Brown University's Choices curriculum have been shut down, and the Anti-Defamation League has removed numerous lesson plans, narrowing its focus to antisemitism and Jewish identity. Organizations like iCivics are seeing a decline in usage of their civics lessons, as teachers fear venturing into politically sensitive discussions. California's move away from ethnic studies, despite research showing its benefits for at-risk students, reflects a broader trend of legislative action to prevent perceived antisemitism and discrimination, leading to concerns about chilling speech.
