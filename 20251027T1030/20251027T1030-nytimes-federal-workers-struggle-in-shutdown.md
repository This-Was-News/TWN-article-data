## Article summary
As the federal government shutdown enters its fifth week, over a million federal employees are working without pay, leading many to seek side jobs, sell personal belongings, and rely on food banks to make ends meet. The prolonged impasse has caused significant financial and emotional distress, with workers facing mounting bills and uncertain futures. Some federal employees are resorting to desperate measures, such as selling sentimental items or seeking loans from their pensions. The situation is particularly dire for those in critical roles like air traffic controllers and T.S.A. officers, with concerns about their ability to continue working under such conditions. While federal law mandates back pay, the president has indicated that not all workers may receive it, and some have been prioritized for payment through reprogramming of funds. Labor unions are advocating for affected members, but even essential programs like SNAP are facing funding shortages. Federal workers express deep frustration with Congress, highlighting the disparity between their unpaid labor and the continued salaries of lawmakers. The shutdown is described as having a devastating impact, with some workers considering quitting their jobs altogether due to the immense pressure and lack of resolution.
