## Article summary
Hurricane Melissa has intensified to Category 5 strength as it approaches Jamaica, bringing the threat of up to 30 inches of rain and a life-threatening storm surge. The storm is forecast to make landfall on the island and then move across Cuba and the Bahamas. With maximum sustained winds of 160 mph, Melissa is the strongest hurricane in recent history expected to directly impact Jamaica. Local areas in eastern Jamaica could receive up to 40 inches of rain, leading to catastrophic flash flooding and landslides. The slow-moving storm has already caused fatalities in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with several people missing. Officials in Jamaica are urging residents to take the threat seriously, emphasizing the potential for severe impacts. Hurricane warnings are in effect for several Cuban provinces, with significant rainfall and storm surge anticipated. Melissa's expected landfall in Cuba could be the strongest hurricane the island has experienced in decades, potentially delaying cleanup efforts due to widespread flooding and blocked roads. The storm surge on Jamaica's southern coast could reach approximately 13 feet. The hurricane has already damaged homes and displaced thousands in the Dominican Republic, and destroyed crops in Haiti, exacerbating an existing hunger crisis.
