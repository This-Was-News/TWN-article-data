## Article summary
Two aircraft, an F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet and an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter, both based on the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, crashed into the South China Sea within a 30-minute period. The three crew members of the helicopter and the two aviators from the fighter jet were safely rescued. The causes of these two crashes are currently under investigation. President Donald Trump suggested that bad fuel might be the cause, ruling out foul play. The USS Nimitz is returning to its home port after a deployment to the Middle East. This incident follows a series of mishaps involving another aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, in recent months. These included a guided-missile cruiser mistakenly shooting down a fighter jet, and two separate instances of fighter jets falling into the Red Sea, one from the hangar deck and another that went overboard after failing to catch arresting cables during landing. In all of these previous incidents, no sailors were killed, and the results of investigations are still pending.
