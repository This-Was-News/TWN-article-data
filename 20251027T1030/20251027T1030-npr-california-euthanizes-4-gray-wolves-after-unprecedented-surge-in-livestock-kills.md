## Article summary
California has euthanized four gray wolves from the Beyem Seyo pack due to an unprecedented surge in livestock kills. These wolves were responsible for 70 livestock losses between late March and early September, representing nearly two-thirds of the state's total wolf-caused depredations during that period. Despite extensive non-lethal deterrents, the wolves became too reliant on cattle as a food source, making it impossible to break the cycle. This decision was made by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) after careful consideration, as it was deemed detrimental to both the long-term recovery of wolves and the well-being of people. Gray wolves were extirpated from California by the 1920s but have been slowly repopulating the state since then, dispersing from Oregon. This resurgence has led to increased conflicts with ranchers, a pattern observed in other states where wolf populations have rebounded. Wildlife officials employ various non-lethal methods to prevent wolf attacks, but these were unsuccessful in this case. The CDFW director emphasized that the euthanasia was a difficult but necessary decision for wolf recovery and human safety. In other parts of the country, gray wolves have been reintroduced or recolonized areas, often leading to similar conflicts between conservation goals and rancher livelihoods. Federal protections for gray wolves in the lower 48 states were removed in 2020 but reinstated by a judge in 2022.
