## Article summary
Officials from the United States and China have indicated that a trade deal is nearing finalization, with Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping expected to conclude it during an upcoming meeting. This potential agreement offers a measure of relief to global markets, even if it doesn't fully resolve underlying issues like manufacturing imbalances and access to advanced computer chips. China's top trade negotiator and the U.S. Treasury Secretary both described the progress as a "preliminary consensus" and a "very successful framework," respectively. President Trump expressed confidence in reaching a deal, stating that both sides desire to make it happen. As part of the preliminary agreements, China is expected to halt the flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl into the U.S. and make substantial purchases of American agricultural products, while also deferring export controls on rare earth elements. This progress was made during the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, where Trump also witnessed a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, brokered partly by his threats of economic pressure. Additionally, Trump signed economic frameworks with Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia aimed at increasing trade and securing supply chains, reducing reliance on China. During the summit, Trump also met with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, discussing potential tariff reductions. However, Trump avoided Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney due to a protest advertisement, threatening increased tariffs on Canada.
