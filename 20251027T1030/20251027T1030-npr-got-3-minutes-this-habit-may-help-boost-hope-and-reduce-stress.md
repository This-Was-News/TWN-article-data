## Article summary
A new study suggests that watching just three to five minutes of inspirational content daily can significantly boost hope and reduce stress. Researchers found that people who feel down are more likely to consume negative social media content, but exposure to uplifting stories, such as those of individuals overcoming adversity, leads to increased feelings of hope. Participants in the study who watched inspiring videos daily for five days reported higher hope levels and lower stress compared to those who watched comedy or no media at all. The positive effects of inspirational videos were found to be comparable to those of meditation in increasing hope. While the effects may not be dramatic, researchers emphasize that these small, positive impacts can accumulate over time, helping individuals feel more capable of managing life's stressors. Experts suggest that actively choosing positive content, even when feeling low, is crucial for mood management. Strategies to counter negative social media algorithms include proactively searching for uplifting content, tracking media consumption and its emotional impact, and periodically resetting social media accounts or taking breaks. These proactive steps can help cultivate a more positive online environment and improve overall well-being.
